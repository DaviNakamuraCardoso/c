# Jukebox
This program uses a [Linked List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list) to sort a set of
song names and write the sorted list to a new file.

## Solution
Using the triple ref pointer technique, all the songs were added to the list in order.
The program then just loops over the list and writes the results to the output.
Finally, the memory is released with a while loop.
