LORD
God
took

put
him

And
the
LORD

commanded
the
Of

the
LORD
God
It
is
not
good
that

will
make
him
an
help
meet
for
Ge2:19
And
out
of
the
ground
the
LORD
God
formed
every
beast
of
the

every
fowl
of

brought
them
unto
Adam
to
see
what
he
would
call
and
whatsoever
Adam
called
every
living
that
was
the
name
Ge2:20
And
Adam
gave
names
to
all

to
every
beast
of

but
for
Adam
there
was
not

And
the
LORD
God
caused
a
deep
sleep
to
fall
upon

he
and
he
took
one

closed
up

And
the

the
LORD
God
had
taken

now
bone
of
my

shall
be
called

she
was
taken
out
of

Therefore
shall
a
man
leave
his
father
and
his

shall
cleave
unto
his

While

Every

I
given

But

And

hand
of
every
beast
will
I
require
and
at

Whoso

Why

And

And
he
left
off
talking
with

God
went
up
from

And
Abraham
took
Ishmael

all
that
were
born
in
his

all
that
were
bought
with
his
every
male
among
the
men
of
Abraham's

circumcised
the
flesh
of
their
foreskin

God
had
said
unto

And
Abraham
was
ninety
years
old

And
Ishmael
his
son
was
thirteen
years
when
he
was

In
the
selfsame
day

And
all
the
men
of

born
in

circumcised
with

And
the
LORD
appeared
unto
him
in
the
plains
of
Mamre:
and
he
sat
in
the
tent

in
the
heat
of
the
Ge18:2
And
he
lift
up
his
eyes
and
three
men
stood
by
and
when
he
saw
he
ran
to
meet
them
from
the
tent
and
bowed
himself
toward
the
Ge18:3
And
My
if
now
I
have
found
favour
in
thy
pass
not
I
pray
from
thy
Ge18:4
Let
a
little
I
pray
be
and
wash
your
and
rest
yourselves
under
the
Ge18:5
And
I
will
fetch
a
morsel
of

comfort
ye
your

that
ye
shall
pass

are
ye
come

And
they
So
as
thou
hast

And
Abraham
hastened
into
the
tent
unto
and
Make
ready
quickly
three
measures
of
fine
knead
and
make
cakes
upon
the
Ge18:7
And
Abraham
ran
unto
the
and
fetcht
a
calf
tender
and
and
gave
it
unto
a
young
and
he
hasted
to
dress
Ge18:8
And
he
took
and
and
the
calf
which
he
had
and
set
it
before
and
he
stood
by
them
under
the
tree
,
and
they
did
Ge18:9
And
they
said
unto
Where
is
Sarah

And
he
in
the
Ge18:10
And
he
I
will
certainly
return
unto
thee
according
to
the
time
of
Sarah
thy
wife
shall
have
a
And
Sarah
heard
it
in
the
tent
which
was
behind
Ge18:11
Now
Abraham
and
Sarah
were
old
and
well
stricken
in
and
it
ceased
to
be
with
Sarah
after
the
manner
of
Ge18:12
Therefore
Sarah
laughed
within
After
I
am
waxed
old
shall
I
have
my
lord
being
old
Ge18:13
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Wherefore
did
Sarah
Shall
I
of
a
surety
bear
a
which
am
Ge18:14
Is
any
thing
too
hard
for
the
At
the
time
appointed
I
will
return
unto
according
to
the
time
of

Sarah
shall
have
a

Then
Sarah
I
laughed
for
she
was
And
he
but
thou
didst
Ge18:16
And
the
men
rose
up
from
and
looked
toward
and
Abraham
went
with
them
to
bring
them
on
the
Ge18:17
And
the
LORD
Shall
I
hide
from
Abraham
that
thing
which
I
Ge18:18
Seeing
that
Abraham
shall
surely
become
a
great
and
mighty
and
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
shall
be
blessed
in
him
?
Ge18:19
For
I
know
that
he
will
command
his
children
and
his
household
after
and
they
shall
keep
the
way
of
the
to
do
justice
and
that
the
LORD
may
bring
upon
Abraham
that
which
he
hath
spoken
of
Ge18:20
And
the
LORD
Because
the
cry
of
Sodom
and
Gomorrah
is
and
because
their
sin
is
very
Ge18:21
I
will
go
down
and
see
whether
they
have
done
altogether
according
to
the
cry
of
which
is
come
unto
and
if
not
,
I
will
Ge18:22
And
the
men
turned
their
faces
from
and
went
toward
but
Abraham
stood
yet
before
the
Ge18:23
And
Abraham
drew
and
Wilt
thou
also
destroy
the
righteous
with
the
Ge18:24
Peradventure
there
be
fifty
righteous
within

not
spare

place
for

That

far
from
thee
to

after
this
to
slay
the
righteous

that
the
righteous
should
be

And
the
LORD
If
I
find
in
Sodom
fifty
righteous
within
the
then
I
will
spare
all
the
place
for
their

And
Abraham
answered
and
Behold
I
have
taken
upon
me
to
speak
unto
the
which
am
but
dust
and
Ge18:28
Peradventure
there
shall
lack
five
of

fifty

thou
destroy
all
the
city
for
lack
of

he
If
I
find
there
forty
and
I
will
not
destroy
Ge18:29
And
he
spake
unto
him
yet
and
Peradventure
there
shall
be
forty
found
And
he
I
will
not
do
it
for
forty's
Ge18:30
And
he
said
unto
Oh
let
not
the
LORD
be

I
will
Peradventure
there
shall
thirty
be
found
And
h

I
will
not
do

And
he
Behold
I
have
taken
upon
me
to
speak
unto

Peradventure
there
shall
be
twenty
found
And

I

And
he
Oh

Peradventure
ten

Ge18:33
And
the
LORD
went

as
soon
as
he
had
left
communing
with
and
Abraham
returned
unto
his
Ge19:1
And
there
came
two
angels
to
Sodom
at
and
Lot
sat
in
the
gate
of

Lot
seeing
them
rose
up
to
meet

he
bowed
himself
with
his
face
toward

And
he
Behold

Behold

And
they
pressed
sore
upon

But
the
men
put
forth

so
that
they
wearied

But
he
seemed
as

And

the
angels
hastened

Then
the

rained
upon

And
Abraham
gat
up
early
in
the
morning
to

place
where
he
stood
before

And
he
looked
toward

toward

the
smoke
of

went
up

And
it
came
to
when
God
destroyed

And
the
firstborn
said
unto
the
Our

And
they
made
their
father
drink

that
and
the
firstborn
went
and
lay
with

and
he
perceived
not
when

And
it
came
to

on
the
that
the
firstborn
said
unto

Thus
were
both
the
daughters
of
Lot
with

And
the
first
born
bare
a

called
his
name
the

is
the
father
of
the
Moabites
unto
this

And
the
she
also
bare

called
his
name
Benammi:
the

is
the
father
of

children
of

Ge20:1
And
Abraham
journeyed
from
thence
toward
the
south
and
dwelled
between
Kadesh
and
Shur,
and
sojourned
in
Gerar.
Ge20:2
And
Abraham
said
of
Sarah
his
She
is
my
and
Abimelech
king
of
Gerar
and
took
Ge20:3
But
God
came
to
Abimelech
in
a
dream
by
and
said
to
thou
art
but
a
dead
for
the
woman
which
thou
ha
st
for
she
is
a
man's
Ge20:4
But
Abimelech
had
not
come
near
and
he
wilt
thou
slay
also
a
righteous
Ge20:5
Said
he
not
unto
She
is
my
and
even
she
herself
He
is
my
in
the
integrity
of
my
heart
and
in
nocency
of
my
hands
have
I
done
Ge20:6
And
God
said
unto
him
in
a
I
know
that
thou
didst
this
in
the
integrity
of
thy
for
I
also
withheld
thee
f
rom
sinning
against
therefore
suffered
I
thee
not
to
touch
Ge20:7
Now
therefore
restore
the
man

he
is

he
shall
pray
for

thou
shalt
and
if
thou
re
store

know
thou
that
thou

all
that
are

Therefore
Abimelech
rose
early
in
the
and
called
all
his
and
told
all
these
things
in
their
and
the
men
were
sore
Ge20:9
Then
Abimelech
called
and
said
unto
What
hast
thou
done
unto
and
what
have
I
offended
that
thou
hast
brought
on
me
and
on
my
kingdom
a
great
thou
hast
done
deeds
unto
me
that
ought
not
to
be

And
Abimelech
said
unto
What
sawest
that
thou
hast
done
this
Ge20:11
And
Abraham
Because
I
Surely
the
fear
of
God
is
not
in
this
and
they
will
slay
me
for
my
wife's
Ge20:12
And
yet
indeed
she
is
my
she
is
the
daughter
of
my
but
not
the
daughter
of
my
and
she
became
my
wif
e.
Ge20:13
And
it
came
to
when
God
caused
me
to
wander
from
my
father's
that
I
said
unto
This
is
thy
kindness
which
thou
shalt
shew
unto
at
every
place
whither
we
shall
say
of
He
is
my
Ge20:14
And
Abimelech
took
and
and
and
womenservants,
and
gave
them
unto
and
restored
him
Sarah
his
Ge20:15
And
Abimelech
my
land
is
before
dwell
where
it
pleaseth
Ge20:16
And
unto
Sarah
he
I
have
given
thy
brother
a
thousand
pieces
of

is
to
thee
a
covering
of
t
he
unto
all
that
are
with
and
with
all
thus
she
was
Ge20:17
So
Abraham
prayed
unto
and
God
healed
Abimelech,
and
his
and
his
maidservants;
and
they
bare
Ge20:18
For
the
LORD
had
fast
closed
up
all
the
wombs
of
the
house
of
Abimelech,
because
of
Sarah
Abraham's
Ge21:1
And
the
LORD
visited
Sarah
as
he
had
and
the
LORD
did
unto
Sarah
as
he
had
Ge21:2
For
Sarah
and
bare
Abraham
a
son
in
his
old
at
the
set
time
of
which
God
had
spoken
to
Ge21:3
And
Abraham
called
the
name
of
his
son
that
was
born
unto
whom
Sarah
bare
to
Ge21:4
And
Abraham
circumcised
his
son
Isaac
being
eight
days
as
God
had
commanded
Ge21:5
And
Abraham
was
an
hundred
years
when
his
son
Isaac
was
born
unto
Ge21:6
And
Sarah
God
hath
made
me
to
so
that
all
that
hear
will
laugh
with
Ge21:7
And
she
Who
would
have
said
unto
that
Sarah
should
have
given
children
for
I
have
born
him
a
son
in
his
old
Ge21:8
And
the
child
and
was
and
Abraham
made
a
great
feast
the
same
day
that
Isaac
was
Ge21:9
And
Sarah
saw
the
son
of
Hagar
the
which
she
had
born
unto
Ge21:10
Wherefore
she
said
unto
Cast
out
this
bondwoman
and
her
for
the
son
of
this
bondwoman
shall
not
be
heir
with
my
even
with
Ge21:11
And
the
thing
was
very
grievous
in
Abraham's
sight
because
of
his
Ge21:12
And
God
said
unto
Let
it
not
be
grievous
in
thy
sight
because
of
the
and
because
of
thy
in
all
tha
t
Sarah
hath
said
unto
hearken
unto
her
for
in
Isaac
shall
thy
seed
be
Ge21:13
And
also
of
the
son
of
the
bondwoman
will
I
make
a
because
he
is
thy
Ge21:14
And
Abraham
rose
up
early
in
the
and
took
and
a
bottle
of
and
gave
it
unto
putting
it
on
her
and
the
and
sent
her
and
she
and
wandered
in
the
wilderness
of
Ge21:15
And
the
water
was
spent
in
the
and
she
cast
the
child
under
one
of
the
Ge21:16
And
she
and
sat
her
down
over
against
him
a
good
way
as
it
were
a
bow
for
she
Let
me
not

dea

of

And
she
sat
over
against
and
lift
up
her
and
Ge21:17
And
God
heard
the
voice
of
the
and
the
angel
of
God
called
to
Hagar
out
of
and
said
unto
What
aileth
thee
,

for
God
hath
heard
the
voice
of
the
lad
where
he
Ge21:18
lift
up
the
and
hold
him
in
thine
for
I
will
make
him
a
great
Ge21:19
And
God
opened
her
and
she
saw
a
well
of
and
she
and
filled
the
bottle
with
and
gave
the
lad

And
God
was
with

and
he
and
dwelt
in
the
and
became
an
Ge21:21
And
he
dwelt
in
the
wilderness
of
Paran:
and
his
mother
took
him
a
wife
out
of
the
land
of
Ge21:22
And
it
came
to
pass
at
that
that
Abimelech
and
Phichol
the
chief
captain
of
his
host
spake
unto
God
is
with
thee
in
all
that
thou
doest:
Ge21:23
Now
therefore
swear
unto
me
here
by
God
that
thou
wilt
not
deal
falsely
with
nor
with
my
nor
with
my
son's
bu

according
to
the
kindness
that
I
have
done
unto
thou
shalt
do
unto
and
to
the
land
wherein
thou
hast
sojourned.
Ge21:24
And
Abraham
I
will
Ge21:25
And
Abraham
reproved
Abimelech
because
of
a
well
of
which
Abimelech's
servants
had
violently
taken
Ge21:26
And
Abimelech
I
wot
not
who
hath
done
this
neither
didst
thou
tell
neither
yet
heard
I
of
but
to
Ge21:27
And
Abraham
took
sheep
and
and
gave
them
unto
Abimelech;
and
both
of
them
made
a
Ge21:28
And
Abraham
set
seven
ewe
lambs
of
the
flock
by
Ge21:29
And
Abimelech
said
unto
What
mean
these
seven
ewe
lambs
which
thou
hast
set
by
Ge21:30
And
he
For
these
seven
ewe
lambs
shalt
thou
take
of
my
that
they
may
be
a
witness
unto
that
I
have
digged
t
his
Ge21:31
Wherefore
he
called
that
place
because
there
they
sware
both
of
Ge21:32
Thus
they
made
a
covenant
at
then
Abimelech
rose
and
Phichol
the
chief
captain
of
his
and
they
returne
d
into
the
land
of
the
Ge21:33
And
Abraham
planted
a
grove
in
and
called
there
on
the
name
of
the
the
everlasting
Ge21:34
And
Abraham
sojourned
in
the
land
many

And
it
came
to
pass
after
these
that
God
did
tempt
and
said
unto
and
he
here

And
he
Take
now
thy
thine
only
son
whom
thou
lovest,
and
get
thee
into
the
land
of
Moriah;
and
offer
him
t
here
for
a
burnt
offering
upon
one
of
the
mountains
which
I
will
tell
thee
Ge22:3
And
Abraham
rose
up
early
in
the
and
saddled
his
and
took
two
of
his
young
men
with
and
Isaac
his
an
d
clave

wood
for
the
burnt
and
rose
and
went
unto
the
place
of
which
God
had
told
Ge22:4
Then
on
the
third
day
Abraham
lifted
up
his
and
saw
the
place
afar
Ge22:5
And
Abraham
said
unto
his
young
Abide

and
I
and
the
lad

go
yonder
and
and
come

to
Ge22:6
And
Abraham
took
the
wood
of
the
burnt
and
laid
it
upon
Isaac
his
and
he
took
the
fire
in
his
and
a

and
they
went
both
of
them

And
Isaac
spake
unto
Abraham

And
he
Behold

but
where

Ge22:8
And
Abraham
My
God
will
provide
himself
a
lamb
for
a
burnt
so
they
went
both
of
them
Ge22:9
And
they
came
to
the
place
which
God
had
told
him
and
Abraham
built
an
altar
and
laid
the
wood
in
and
boun

Isaac

and
laid
him
on
the
altar
upon

Ge22:10
And
Abraham
stretched
forth
his
and
took
the
knife
to
slay
his
Ge22:11
And
the
angel
of
the
LORD
called
unto
him
out
of

and
he
Here
am
Ge22:12
And
he
Lay

neither
do

any

unto
for
now
I
know
that
thou
fearest
see

thou
hast
not
withheld
thy
thine
only
son
from
Ge22:13
And
Abraham
lifted
up
his
and
and
behold
behind
him
a
ram
caught
in
a
thicket
by
his
and
Abraham
went
and
took
the
and
offered
him
up
for
a
burnt
offering
in
the
stead
of
his
Ge22:14
And
Abraham
called
the
name
of
that
place

it
is
said
to
this
In

And
the
angel
of
the
LORD
called
unto
Abraham
out
of

And
By
myself
have
I
saith

done
this
and

That

So
Abraham
returned
unto

they
rose
up

went
together

And
the
first

And
after
that

And
Jacob
Sell

And
Jacob

Ge26:2
And
the
LORD
appeared
unto

land
which
I
shall
tell
thee
Ge26:3
Sojourn
in

and
I
will
be
with

will
bless

unto
thy

will
give
all
these
and
I
will
perform
the
oath
which
I
sware
unto
Abraham
thy
Ge26:4
And
I
will
make
thy
seed
to
multiply
as

give
unto
thy
seed
all
these
and
in
thy
see

Because
that
Abraham
obeyed
my
and
kept
my
my
my
and
my
Ge26:6
And
Isaac
dwelt
in
Gerar:
Ge26:7
And
the
men
of
the
place
asked
him
of
his

he
She
is
my
for
he
feared
to
She
is
my
s
aid
the
men
of
the
place
should
kill
me
for
Rebekah;
because
she
was
fair
to
look
Ge26:8
And
it
came
to
when
he
had
been
there
a
long
that
Abimelech
king
of
the
Philistines
looked
out
at
a
and
Isaac
was
sporting
with
Rebekah
his
Ge26:9
And
Abimelech
called
and
of
a
surety
she
is
thy
and
how
saidst
She
is
my
And
Isaac
said
unto
Because
I
Lest
I
die
for
Ge26:10
And
Abimelech
What
is
this
thou
hast
done
unto
one
of
the
people
might
lightly
have
lien
with
thy
and
thou
shouldest
have
brought
guiltiness
upon
Ge26:11
And
Abimelech
charged
all
his
He
that
toucheth
this
man
or
his
wife
shall
surely
be
put
to

Then
Isaac
sowed
in
that
and
received
in
the
same
year
an

the
LORD
blessed
Ge26:13
And
the
man
waxed
and
went
and
grew
until
he
became
very

For
he
had
possession
of
and
possession
of

great
store
of

the
Philistines
envied
Ge26:15
For
all
the
wells
which
his
father's
servants
had
digged
in
the
days
of
Abraham
his
the
Philistines
had
stopped
the

and
filled
them
with

And
Abimelech
said
unto
Go
from
for
thou
art
much
mightier
than
Ge26:17
And
Isaac
departed
and
pitched
his
tent
in
the
valley
of
Gerar,
and
dwelt
Ge26:18
And
Isaac
digged
again
the
wells
of
which
they
had
digged
in
the
days
of
Abraham
his
for
the
Philistines
had
stopped
them
after
the
death
of
and
he
called
their
names
after
the
names
by
which
his
father
had
called
Ge26:19
And
Isaac's
servants
digged
in
the
and
found
there
a
well
of
springing
Ge26:20
And
the
herdmen
of
Gerar
did
strive
with
Isaac's
herdmen,
The
water
is
and
he
called
the
name
of
the
well
Ese
k;
because
they
strove
with
Ge26:21
And
they
digged
another
and
strove
for
that
and
he
called
the
name
of
it
Sitnah.
Ge26:22
And
he
removed
from
and
digged
another
and
for
that
they
strove
and
he
called
the
name
of
it
Rehoboth;
a
nd
he
For
now
the
LORD
hath
made
room
for
and
we
shall
be
fruitful
in
the
Ge26:23
And
he
went
up
from
thence
to
Ge26:24
And
the
LORD
appeared
unto
him
the
same
and
I
am
the
God
of
Abraham
thy
fear
for
I
am
with
and
will
bless
and
multiply
thy
seed
for
my
servant
Abraham's
Ge26:25
And
he
builded
an
altar
and
called
upon
the
name
of
the
and
pitched
his
tent
and
there
Isaac's
servants
digged
a
Ge26:26
Then
Abimelech
went
to
him
from
Gerar,
and
Ahuzzath
one
of
his
and
Phichol
the
chief
captain
of
his
Ge26:27
And
Isaac
said
unto
Wherefore
come
ye
to
seeing
ye
hate
and
have
sent
me
away
from
Ge26:28
And
they
We
saw
certainly
that
the
LORD
was
with
and
we
Let
there
be
now
an
oath
betwixt
even
betwixt
us
and
and
let
us
make
a
covenant
with
Ge26:29
That
thou
wilt
do
us
no
as
we
have
not
touched
and
as
we
have
done
unto
thee
nothing
but
and
have
sent
th
ee
away
in
thou
art
now
the
blessed
of
the
Ge26:30
And
he
made
them
a
and
they
did
eat
and
Ge26:31
And
they
rose
up
betimes
in
the
and
sware
one
to
and
Isaac
sent
them
and
they
departed
from
him
in
Ge26:32
And
it
came
to
pass
the
same
that
Isaac's
servants
and
told
him
concerning
the
well
which
they
had
and
s
aid
unto
We
have
found
Ge26:33
And
he
called
it
Shebah:
therefore
the
name
of
the
city
is
Beersheba
unto
this
Ge26:34
And
Esau
was
forty
years
old
when
he
took
to
wife
Judith
the
daughter
of
Beeri
the
and
Bashemath
the
daughter
of
E
lon
the
Ge26:35
Which
were
a
grief
of
mind
unto
Isaac
and
to
Rebekah.
Ge27:1
And
it
came
to
that
when
Isaac
was
and
his
eyes
were
so
that
he
could
not
he
called
Esau
his
eldest
son
,
and
said
unto
My
and
he
said
unto
here
am
Ge27:2
And
he
Behold
I
am
I
know
not
the
day
of
my
Ge27:3
Now
therefore
I
pray
thy
thy
quiver
and
thy
and
go
out
to
the
and
take
me
some
Ge27:4
And
make
me
savoury
such
as
I
and
bring
it
to
that
I
may
that
my
soul
may
bless
thee
before
I
Ge27:5
And
Rebekah
heard
when
Isaac
spake
to
Esau
his
And
Esau
went
to
the
field
to
hunt
for
and
to
bring
Ge27:6
And
Rebekah
spake
unto
Jacob
her
I
heard
thy
father
speak
unto
Esau
thy
Ge27:7
Bring
me
and
make
me
savoury
that
I
may
and
bless
thee
before
the
LORD
before
my
Ge27:8
Now
my
obey
my
voice
according
to
that
which
I
command
Ge27:9
Go
now
to
the
and
fetch
me
from
thence
two
good
kids
of
the
and
I
will
make
them
savoury
meat
for
thy
such
as
he
loveth:
Ge27:10
And
thou
shalt
bring
it
to
thy
that
he
may
and
that
he
may
bless
thee
before
his
Ge27:11
And
Jacob
said
to
Rebekah
his
Esau
my
brother
is
a
hairy
and
I
am
a
smooth
Ge27:12
My
father
peradventure
will
feel
and
I
shall
seem
to
him
as
a
and
I
shall
bring
a
curse
upon
and
not
a
bl
essing.
Ge27:13
And
his
mother
said
unto
Upon
me
be
thy
my
only
obey
my
and
go
fetch
me
Ge27:14
And
he
and
and
brought
them
to
his
and
his
mother
made
savoury
such
as
his
father
Ge27:15
And
Rebekah
took
goodly
raiment
of
her
eldest
son
which
were
with
her
in
the
and
put
them
upon
Jacob
her
young
er
Ge27:16
And
she
put
the
skins
of
the
kids
of
the
goats
upon
his
and
upon
the
smooth
of
his
Ge27:17
And
she
gave
the
savoury
meat
and
the
which
she
had
into
the
hand
of
her
son
Ge27:18
And
he
came
unto
his
and
My
and
he
Here
am
who
art
my
Ge27:19
And
Jacob
said
unto
his
I
am
Esau
thy
first
I
have
done
according
as
thou
badest
I
pray
sit
and
eat
of
my
that
thy
soul
may
bless
Ge27:20
And
Isaac
said
unto
his
How
is
it
that
thou
hast
found
it
so
my
And
he
Because
the
LORD
thy
God
br
ought
it
to
Ge27:21
And
Isaac
said
unto
Come
I
pray
that
I
may
feel
my
whether
thou
be
my
very
son
Esau
or
Ge27:22
And
Jacob
went
near
unto
Isaac
his
and
he
felt
and
The
voice
is
Jacob's
but
the
hands
are
the
han
ds
of
Ge27:23
And
he
discerned
him
because
his
hands
were
as
his
brother
Esau's
so
he
blessed
Ge27:24
And
he
Art
thou
my
very
son
And
he
I
Ge27:25
And
he
Bring
it
near
to
and
I
will
eat
of
my
son's
that
my
soul
may
bless
And
he
brought
it
near
t
o
and
he
did
and
he
brought
him
and
he
Ge27:26
And
his
father
Isaac
said
unto
Come
near
and
kiss
my
Ge27:27
And
he
came
and
kissed
and
he
smelled
the
smell
of
his
and
blessed
and
the
smell
of
my
son
is
as
the
smell
of
a
field
which
the
LORD
hath
Ge27:28
Therefore
God
give
thee
of
the
dew
of
and
the
fatness
of
the
and
plenty
of
corn
and
Ge27:29
Let
people
serve
and
nations
bow
down
to
be
lord
over
thy
and
let
thy
mother's
sons
bow
down
to
cursed
be
every
one
that
curseth
and
blessed
be
he
that
blesseth
Ge27:30
And
it
came
to
as
soon
as
Isaac
had
made
an
end
of
blessing
and
Jacob
was
yet
scarce
gone
out
from
the
presenc
e
of
Isaac
his
that
Esau
his
brother
came
in
from
his
Ge27:31
And
he
also
had
made
savoury
and
brought
it
unto
his
and
said
unto
his
Let
my
father
and
eat
o
f
his
son's
that
thy
soul
may
bless
Ge27:32
And
Isaac
his
father
said
unto
Who
art
And
he
I
am
thy
thy
firstborn
Ge27:33
And
Isaac
trembled
very
and
where
is
he
that
hath
taken
and
brought
it
and
I
have
eate
n
of
all
before
thou
camest,
and
have
blessed
and
he
shall
be
Ge27:34
And
when
Esau
heard
the
words
of
his
he
cried
with
a
great
and
exceeding
bitter
and
said
unto
his
Bles
s
even
me
O
my
Ge27:35
And
he
Thy
brother
came
with
and
hath
taken
away
thy
Ge27:36
And
he
Is
not
he
rightly
named
for
he
hath
supplanted
me
these
two
he
took
away
my
beh
now
he
hath
taken
away
my
And
he
Hast
thou
not
reserved
a
blessing
for
Ge27:37
And
Isaac
answered
and
said
unto
I
have
made
him
thy
and
all
his
brethren
have
I
given
to
him
for
serva
nts;
and
with
corn
and
wine
have
I
sustained
and
what
shall
I
do
now
unto
my
Ge27:38
And
Esau
said
unto
his
Hast
thou
but
one
my
bless
even
me
O
my
And
Esau
lifted
up
his
and
Ge27:39
And
Isaac
his
father
answered
and
said
unto
thy
dwelling
shall
be
the
fatness
of
the
and
of
the
dew
of
heaven
from
Ge27:40
And
by
thy
sword
shalt
thou
and
shalt
serve
thy
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
when
thou
shalt
have
the
that
thou
shalt
break
his
yoke
from
off
thy
Ge27:41
And
Esau
hated
Jacob
because
of
the
blessing
wherewith
his
father
blessed
and
Esau
said
in
his
The
days
of
mour
ning
for
my
father
are
at
then
will
I
slay
my
brother
Ge27:42
And
these
words
of
Esau
her
elder
son
were
told
to
Rebekah:
and
she
sent
and
called
Jacob
her
younger
and
said
unto
hi
m,
thy
brother
as
touching
doth
comfort
purposing
to
kill
Ge27:43
Now
my
obey
my
and
flee
thou
to
Laban
my
brother
to
Haran;
Ge27:44
And
tarry
with
him
a
few
until
thy
brother's
fury
turn
Ge27:45
Until
thy
brother's
anger
turn
away
from
and
he
forget
that
which
thou
hast
done
to
then
I
will
and
fetch
thee
from
why
should
I
be
deprived
also
of
you
both
in
one
Ge27:46
And
Rebekah
said
to
I
am
weary
of
my
life
because
of
the
daughters
of
if
Jacob
take
a
wife
of
the
daughters
of
such
as
these
which
are
of
the
daughters
of
the
what
good
shall
my
life
do
Ge28:1
And
Isaac
called
and
blessed
and
charged
and
said
unto
Thou
shalt
not
take
a
wife
of
the
daughters
of
Ge28:2
go
to
Padanaram,
to
the
house
of
Bethuel
thy
mother's
and
take
thee
a
wife
from
thence
of
the
daughters
of
La
ban
thy
mother's
Ge28:3
And
God
Almighty
bless
and
make
thee
and
multiply
that
thou
mayest
be
a
multitude
of
Ge28:4
And
give
thee
the
blessing
of
to
and
to
thy
seed
with
that
thou
mayest
inherit
the
land
wherein
thou
ar
t
a
which
God
gave
unto
Ge28:5
And
Isaac
sent
away
and
he
went
to
Padanaram
unto
son
of
Bethuel
the
the
brother
of
Rebekah,
Jacob's
a
nd
Esau's
Ge28:6
When
Esau
saw
that
Isaac
had
blessed
and
sent
him
away
to
Padanaram,
to
take
him
a
wife
from
and
that
as
he
b
lessed
him
he
gave
him
a
Thou
shalt
not
take
a
wife
of
the
daughters
of
Ge28:7
And
that
Jacob
obeyed
his
father
and
his
and
was
gone
to
Padanaram;
Ge28:8
And
Esau
seeing
that
the
daughters
of
Canaan
pleased
not
Isaac
his
Ge28:9
Then
went
Esau
unto
and
took
unto
the
wives
which
he
had
Mahalath
the
daughter
of
Ishmael
Abraham's
the
sister
of
Nebajoth,
to
be
his
Ge28:10
And
Jacob
went
out
from
and
went
toward
Haran.
Ge28:11
And
he
lighted
upon
a
certain
and
tarried
there
all
because
the
sun
was
and
he
took
of
the
stones
of
tha
t
and
put
them
for
his
and
lay
down
in
that
place
to
Ge28:12
And
he
and

a
ladder
set
up
on
the
and
the
top
of
it
reached
to
and
behold
the
angels
of
God
ascending
and
descending
on
Ge28:13
the
LORD
stood
above
and
I
am
the
LORD
God
of
Abraham
thy
and
the
God
of
the
land
whe
reon
thou
liest,
to
thee
will
I
give
and
to
thy
Ge28:14
And
thy
seed
shall
be
as
the
dust
of
the
and
thou
shalt
spread
abroad
to
the
and
to
the
and
to
the
north
,
and
to
the
and
in
thee
and
in
thy
seed
shall
all
the
families
of
the
earth
be
Ge28:15
I
am
with
and
will
keep
thee
in
all
places
whither
thou
goest,
and
will
bring
thee
again
into
this
for
I
will
not
leave
until
I
have
done
that
which
I
have
spoken
to
thee
Ge28:16
And
Jacob
awaked
out
of
his
and
he
Surely
the
LORD
is
in
this
and
I
knew
it
Ge28:17
And
he
was
and
How
dreadful
is
this
this
is
none
other
but
the
house
of
and
this
is
the
gate
of
h
eaven.
Ge28:18
And
Jacob
rose
up
early
in
the
and
took
the
stone
that
he
had
put
for
his
and
set
it
up
for
a
and
poured
oil
upon
the
top
of
Ge28:19
And
he
called
the
name
of
that
place
but
the
name
of
that
city
was
called
Luz
at
the
Ge28:20
And
Jacob
vowed
a
If
God
will
be
with
and
will
keep
me
in
this
way
that
I
and
will
give
me
bread
to
ea
t,
and
raiment
to
put
Ge28:21
So
that
I
come
again
to
my
father's
house
in
then
shall
the
LORD
be
my
Ge28:22
And
this
which
I
have
set
for
a
shall
be
God's
and
of
all
that
thou
shalt
give
me
I
will
surely
give
the
tenth
unto
Ge29:1
Then
Jacob
went
on
his
and
came
into
the
land
of
the
people
of
the
Ge29:2
And
he
and
behold
a
well
in
the
there
were
three
flocks
of
sheep
lying
by
for
out
of
that
well
t
hey
watered
the
and
a
great
stone
was
upon
the
well's
Ge29:3
And
thither
were
all
the
flocks
and
they
rolled
the
stone
from
the
well's
and
watered
the
and
put
th
e
stone
again
upon
the
well's
mouth
in
his
Ge29:4
And
Jacob
said
unto
My
whence
be
And
they
Of
Haran
are
Ge29:5
And
he
said
unto
Know
ye
Laban
the
son
of
Nahor?
And
they
We
know
Ge29:6
And
he
said
unto
Is
he
And
they
He
is
Rachel
his
daughter
cometh
with
the
Ge29:7
And
he
it
is
yet
high
neither
is
it
time
that
the
cattle
should
be
gathered
water
ye
the
and
go
and
feed
Ge29:8
And
they
We
until
all
the
flocks
be
gathered
and
till
they
roll
the
stone
from
the
well's
the
n
we
water
the
Ge29:9
And
while
he
yet
spake
with
Rachel
came
with
her
father's
for
she
kept
Ge29:10
And
it
came
to
when
Jacob
saw
Rachel
the
daughter
of
Laban
his
mother's
and
the
sheep
of
Laban
his
mother's
that
Jacob
went
and
rolled
the
stone
from
the
well's
and
watered
the
flock
of
Laban
his
mother's
Ge29:11
And
Jacob
kissed
and
lifted
up
his
and
Ge29:12
And
Jacob
told
Rachel
that
he
was
her
father's
and
that
he
was
Rebekah's
and
she
ran
and
told
her
Ge29:13
And
it
came
to
when
Laban
heard
the
tidings
of
Jacob
his
sister's
that
he
ran
to
meet
and
embraced
and
kissed
and
brought
him
to
his
And
he
told
Laban
all
these
Ge29:14
And
Laban
said
to
Surely
thou
art
my
bone
and
my
And
he
abode
with
him
the
space
of
a
Ge29:15
And
Laban
said
unto
Because
thou
art
my
shouldest
thou
therefore
serve
me
for
tell
what
shall
t
hy
wages
Ge29:16
And
Laban
had
two
the
name
of
the
elder
was
and
the
name
of
the
younger
was
Ge29:17
Leah
was
tender
but
Rachel
was
beautiful
and
well
Ge29:18
And
Jacob
loved
and
I
will
serve
thee
seven
years
for
Rachel
thy
younger
Ge29:19
And
Laban
It
is
better
that
I
give
her
to
than
that
I
should
give
her
to
another
abide
with
Ge29:20
And
Jacob
served
seven
years
for
and
they
seemed
unto
him
but
a
few
for
the
love
he
had
to
Ge29:21
And
Jacob
said
unto
Give
me
my
for
my
days
are
that
I
may
go
in
unto
Ge29:22
And
Laban
gathered
together
all
the
men
of
the
and
made
a
Ge29:23
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
that
he
took
Leah

and
brought
her
to
and
he
went
in
unto
Ge29:24
And
Laban
gave
unto
his
daughter
Leah
Zilpah
his
maid
for
an
Ge29:25
And
it
came
to
that
in
the
it
was
and
he
said
to
What
is
this
thou
hast
done
unto
d
id
not
I
serve
with
thee
for
wherefore
then
hast
thou
beguiled
Ge29:26
And
Laban
It
must
not
be
so
done
in
our
to
give
the
younger
before
the
Ge29:27
Fulfil
her
and
we
will
give
thee
this
also
for
the
service
which
thou
shalt
serve
with
me
yet
seven
other

And
Jacob
did
and
fulfilled

And
Laban
gave
to

went
in
also
unto
and
he
loved
also
Rachel
more
than

served
with
him
yet
seven
other

And
when
the
LORD
saw
that
Leah
was

opened
her
but
Rachel

And
Leah
and
bare

said
unto

And
Jacob's
anger
was
kindled
against

he
Am
I
in
God's

hath
withheld
from
thee
the
fruit
of
the

And

wrestlings
have
I
wrestled
with

When

And
Reuben
went
in
the
days
of
wheat
and
found
mandrakes
in
the

brought
them
unto
his
mother
Then
Rachel
said
to
Give

And
she
said
unto
Is
it
a
small
matter
that
thou
hast
taken
my
and
wouldest
thou
take
away
my
son's
mandrakes
And
Rachel
Therefore
he
shall
lie
with
thee
to
night
for
thy
son's
Ge30:16
And
Jacob
came
out
of
the
field
in
the
and
Leah
went
out
to
meet
and
Thou
must
come
in
unto
for
sur
ely
I
have
hired
thee
with
my
son's
And
he
lay
with
her
that
Ge30:17
And
God
hearkened
unto
and
she
and
bare

the
fifth
Ge30:18
And

hath
given

And

And
Leah

And
afterwards

And
she
called

and
The
LORD
shall
add
to
me
another
Ge30:25
And
it
came
to
when
Rachel
had
born
that
Jacob
said
unto
Send
me
that
I
may
go
unto
mine
own
pla
ce,
and
to
my
Ge30:26
Give
me
my
wives
and
my
for
whom
I
have
served
and
let
me
for
thou
knowest
my
service
which
I
have
done
Ge30:27
And
Laban
said
unto
I
pray
if
I
have
found
favour
in
thine
for
I
have
learned
by
experience
that
th
e
LORD
hath
blessed
me
for
thy
Ge30:28
And
he
Appoint
me
thy
and
I
will
give
Ge30:29
And
he
said
unto
Thou
knowest
how
I
have
served
and
how
thy
cattle
was
with
Ge30:30
For
it
was
little
which
thou
hadst
before
I
and
it
is
now
increased
unto
a
and
the
LORD
hath
blessed
thee
since
my
and
now
when
shall
I
provide
for
mine
own
house
Ge30:31
And
he
What
shall
I
give
And
Jacob
Thou
shalt
not
give
me
any
if
thou
wilt
do
this
thing
for
I
will
again
feed
and
keep
thy
Ge30:32
I
will
pass
through
all
thy
flock
to
removing
from
thence
all
the
speckled
and
spotted
and
all
the
brown
cattl
e
among
the
and
the
spotted
and
speckled
among
the
and
of
such
shall
be
my
Ge30:33
So
shall
my
righteousness
answer
for
me
in
time
to
when
it
shall
come
for
my
hire
before
thy
every
one
that
is
not
speckled
and
spotted
among
the
and
brown
among
the
that
shall
be
counted
stolen
with
Ge30:34
And
Laban
I
would
it
might
be
according
to
thy
Ge30:35
And
he
removed
that
day
the
he
goats
that
were
ringstraked
and
and
all
the
she
goats
that
were
speckled
and
spotte
d,
and
every
one
that
had
some
white
in
and
all
the
brown
among
the
and
gave
them
into
the
hand
of
his
Ge30:36
And
he
set
three
journey
betwixt
himself
and
and
Jacob
fed
the
rest
of
Laban's
Ge30:37
And
Jacob
took
him
rods
of
green
and
of
the
hazel
and
chestnut
and
pilled
white
strakes
in
and
made
the
white
appear
which
was
in
the
Ge30:38
And
he
set
the
rods
which
he
had
pilled
before
the
flocks
in
the
gutters
in
the
watering
troughs
when
the
flocks
came
to
dr
that
they
should
conceive
when
they
came
to
Ge30:39
And
the
flocks
conceived
before
the
and
brought
forth
cattle
and
Ge30:40
And
Jacob
did
separate
the
and
set
the
faces
of
the
flocks
toward
the
and
all
the
brown
in
the
flock
of
and
he
put
his
own
flocks
by
and
put
them
not
unto
Laban's
Ge30:41
And
it
came
to
whensoever
the
stronger
cattle
did
that
Jacob
laid
the
rods
before
the
eyes
of
the
cattle
in
the
that
they
might
conceive
among
the
Ge30:42
But
when
the
cattle
were
he
put
them
not
so
the
feebler
were
and
the
stronger
Jacob's.
Ge30:43
And
the
man
increased
and
had
much
and
maidservants,
and
and
and
Ge31:1
And
he
heard
the
words
of
Laban's
Jacob
hath
taken
away
all
that
was
our
and
of
that
which
was
our
f
ather's
hath
he
gotten
all
this
Ge31:2
And
Jacob
beheld
the
countenance
of
it
was
not
toward
him
as
Ge31:3
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Return
unto
the
land
of
thy
and
to
thy
and
I
will
be
with
Ge31:4
And
Jacob
sent
and
called
Rachel
and
Leah
to
the
field
unto
his
Ge31:5
And
said
unto
I
see
your
father's
that
it
is
not
toward
me
as
but
the
God
of
my
father
hath
been
with
Ge31:6
And
ye
know
that
with
all
my
power
I
have
served
your
Ge31:7
And
your
father
hath
deceived
and
changed
my
wages
ten
but
God
suffered
him
not
to
hurt
Ge31:8
If
he
said
The
speckled
shall
be
thy
then
all
the
cattle
bare
and
if
he
said
The
ringstraked
sh
all
be
thy
then
bare
all
the
cattle
Ge31:9
Thus
God
hath
taken
away
the
cattle
of
your
and
given
them
to
Ge31:10
And
it
came
to
pass
at
the
time
that
the
cattle
that
I
lifted
up
mine
and
saw
in
a
the
rams
which
leaped
upon
the
cattle
were
and
grisled.
Ge31:11
And
the
angel
of
God
spake
unto
me
in
a
And
I
Here
am
Ge31:12
And
he
Lift
up
now
thine
and
all
the
rams
which
leap
upon
the
cattle
are
and
grisle
d:
for
I
have
seen
all
that
Laban
doeth
unto
Ge31:13
I
am
the
God
of
where
thou
anointedst
the
and
where
thou
vowedst
a
vow
unto
now
get
thee
out
fro
m
this
and
return
unto
the
land
of
thy
Ge31:14
And
Rachel
and
Leah
answered
and
said
unto
Is
there
yet
any
portion
or
inheritance
for
us
in
our
father's
Ge31:15
Are
we
not
counted
of
him
for
he
hath
sold
and
hath
quite
devoured
also
our
Ge31:16
For
all
the
riches
which
God
hath
taken
from
our
that
is
and
our
now
whatsoever
God
hath
sa
id
unto
Ge31:17
Then
Jacob
rose
and
set
his
sons
and
his
wives
upon
Ge31:18
And
he
carried
away
all
his
and
all
his
goods
which
he
had
the
cattle
of
his
which
he
had
gotten
i
n
Padanaram,
for
to
go
to
Isaac
his
father
in
the
land
of
Ge31:19
And
Laban
went
to
shear
his
and
Rachel
had
stolen
the
images
that
were
her
Ge31:20
And
Jacob
stole
away
unawares
to
Laban
the
in
that
he
told
him
not
that
he
Ge31:21
So
he
fled
with
all
that
he
and
he
rose
and
passed
over
the
and
set
his
face
toward
the
mount
Ge31:22
And
it
was
told
Laban
on
the
third
day
that
Jacob
was
Ge31:23
And
he
took
his
brethren
with
and
pursued
after
him
seven
and
they
overtook
him
in
the
mount
Ge31:24
And
God
came
to
Laban
the
Syrian
in
a
dream
by
and
said
unto
Take
heed
that
thou
speak
not
to
Jacob
either
good
or
Ge31:25
Then
Laban
overtook
Now
Jacob
had
pitched
his
tent
in
the
and
Laban
with
his
brethren
pitched
in
the
mount
of
Ge31:26
And
Laban
said
to
What
hast
thou
that
thou
hast
stolen
away
unawares
to
and
carried
away
my
as
captives
taken

Wherefore
didst
thou
flee

didst
not

I
might

sent
thee
away
wi

And
hast
not
suffered
me
to

It
is
in
the
power
of
my
hand
to

but
the
God
of
your
father
spake
unto
me
yesternight,
Take
thou
heed
that
thou
speak
not
to
Jacob
either
good
or

And
though
thou
wouldest
needs
be
because
thou
sore
longedst
after
thy
father's

wherefore
hast
thou
s

Ge31:31
And
Jacob
answered
and
said
to
Because
I
was
for

Peradventure
thou
wouldest
take
by
force
thy

With

thou
findest

what

For
Jacob
knew
not
that
Rachel
had
stolen
Ge31:33
And
Laban
went
into
Jacob's
and
into
Leah's
and
into
the
two
maidservants'
but
he
found
them
Then
w

he
out
of
Leah's

entered
into
Rachel's
Ge31:34
Now
Rachel
had
taken
the

put
them
in
the
camel's
and
sat
upon
And
Laban
searched
all
the
but
found
them
Ge31:35
And
she
said
to
her
Let
it
not
displease
my
lord
that
I
cannot
rise
up

custom
of

And
he
but
found

Ge31:36
And
Jacob
was
and
chode
with
and
Jacob
answered
and
said
to
What

my
that
thou
hast
so
hotly
pursued
after

Whereas
thou
hast
searched

This
twenty
years

Thus
I
in
the
day

drought
consumed

the
frost

departed
from

Ge31:41
Thus

Ge31:43
And
Laban
answered
and
said
unto
These
daughters

these
children

Jacob
called

This

Therefore

Laban
said
to

This

Then
Jacob
offered

they
did

And
early
in

morning
Laban
rose

kissed
his
sons

And
Jacob
went
on

the
angels
of

And
when
Jacob
saw
he
This
is
God's

he
called

Ge32:3
And
Jacob
sent
messengers
before
him
to
Esau
his
brother
unto
the
land
of
Seir,
the
country
of

And
he
commanded
Thus
shall
ye
speak
unto
my
lord
Thy
servant
Jacob
saith
I
have
sojourned
with
La
and
stayed
there
until
Ge32:5
And
I
have

and
and
womenservants:
and
I
have
sent
to
tell
my
that
I
may
find

And
the
messengers
returned
to
We
came
to
thy
brother
and
also
he
cometh
to
meet
and
four
hundred
men
with
Ge32:7
Then
Jacob
was
greatly
afraid
and
and
he
divided
the
people
that
was
with

the
and
and
th

into
two

And
If
Esau
come
to
the
one
and
smite

which
is
left

And
Jacob
O
God
of

of

which
saidst
unto
Return
unto
thy
count

and
to
thy
and
I
will
deal
well
with
Ge32:10
I
am
not
worthy
of
the
least
of
all
the
and
of
all
the
which
thou
hast
shewed
unto
thy
for
with
my
staff
I
passed
over

and
now
I
am
become

Deliver

pray
from

I
fear
lest

And
thou
saidst,

surely
do
thee

Ge32:13
And
he
lodged
there
that
same
and
took

that
which
came
to
his
hand
a
present
for
Esau

Ge32:14
Two

Thirty

And
he
delivered
them
into
the
hand
of
his
every
drove
by
and
said
unto
his
Pass
over

and
put
a
space
betwixt

And
he
commanded
the
When

Jacob's;
it
is
a
present
sent
unto
my
lord
also
he
is
behind

Ge32:19
And
so
commanded
he
the
and
the
and
all
that
followed
the
On
this
manner
shall
ye
speak
unto
when
ye

And
say
ye
thy

For
he
I
will
appease
him
with
the

afterward
I
will
see
his

So
went
the
present
over
before
and
himself
lodged
that
night
in
the
Ge32:22
And
he
rose
up
that
and
took
his
two
and
his
two
womenservants,
and
his
eleven
and
passed
over
the
ford
Jabbok.
Ge32:23
And
he
took

sent
them
over

sent
over

And
Jacob
was
left
and
there
wrestled
a
man
with
him
until
the
breaking
of
the
Ge32:25
And
when
he
saw
that
he
prevailed
not
against

touched
the
hollow
of
his
and
the
hollow
of
Jacob's
thigh
was
out
of
as
he
wrestled
with
Ge32:26
And
he
Let
me
for
the
day
breaketh.
And

I
will
not
let
thee

thou
bless

And
he
said
unto
What
is
thy
And
he
Ge32:28
And
he
Thy
name
shall
be
called
no
more
but
for

a
prince

thou
power
with
God
and
with

hast

And
Jacob
asked
and
Tell

pray
thy
And
he
Wherefore
is
it
that
thou
dost
ask
after
my
nam

And
he
blessed
him
Ge32:30
And
Jacob
called
the
name
of
the
place
Peniel:
for
I
have
seen
God
face
to
and
my
life
is

And
as
he
passed
over
Penuel
the
sun
rose
upon
and
he
halted
upon
his
Ge32:32
Therefore
the
children
of
Israel

And
Jacob
lifted
up
his
and
Esau
and
with
him
four
hundred
And
he
divided
the
children
unto
and
unto
and
unto
the
two
handmaids.
Ge33:2
And
he
put
the
handmaids
and
their
children
and
Leah
and
her
children
and
Rachel
and
Joseph
hindermost.
Ge33:3
And
he
passed
over
before
and
bowed
himself
to
the
ground
seven
until
he
came
near
to
his
Ge33:4
And
Esau
ran
to
meet
and
embraced
and
fell
on
his
and
kissed
and
they

And
he
lifted
up
his

saw
the
women
and
the

Who
are
those
with
And
he
The
children

God
hath
graciously
given

Then
the
handmaidens
came
they
and
their
and
they
bowed
Ge33:7
And
Leah
also
with
her
children
came
and
bowed
and
after
came
Joseph
near

and
they
bowed

And
he
What
meanest
thou
by
all
this
drove
which

And
he
These
are
to
find
grace
in
the
sight
of

And
Esau
I
have
my
keep
that
thou
hast
unto
Ge33:10
And
Jacob
I
pray
if
now
I
have
found
grace
in
thy
then
receive
my
present
at
my
for
therefore
I
have
seen
thy
as
though
I
had
seen
the
face
of

thou
wast
pleased
with
Ge33:11
I
pray
my
blessing
that
is
brought
to

God
hath
dealt
graciously
with

because
I
have

And
he
urged
and
he
took
Ge33:12
And
he
Let
us
take
our
and
let
us
and
I
will
go
before
Ge33:13
And
he
said
unto
My
lord
knoweth
that
the
children
are
and
the
flocks
and
herds
with
young
are
with
and
if
men
should
overdrive
them
one
all
the
flock
will

Let
my

pray
pass
over

I
will
lead
on
according
as
the
cattle
that
goeth
befor

me
and
the
children
be
able
to

I
come
unto
my
lord
unto
Seir.
Ge33:15
And
Esau
Let
me
now
leave
with
thee
some
of

folk
that
are
with

he
What
needeth

So
Esau
returned
that
day
on
his
way
unto
Seir.
Ge33:17
And
Jacob
journeyed
to
and
built
him
an
and
made
booths
for
his
therefore
the
name
of
the
place
is
called
Ge33:18
And
Jacob
came
to
Shalem,
a
city
of
which
is
in
the
land
of
when
he
came
from
Padanaram;
and
pitched
his
t
ent
before
the
Ge33:19
And
he
bought
a
parcel
of
a
where
he
had
spread
his
at
the
hand
of
the
children
of
Hamor,
Shechem's
fo
r
an
hundred
pieces
of
Ge33:20
And
he
erected
there
an
and
called
it
EleloheIsrael.
Ge34:1
And
Dinah
the
daughter
of
which
she
bare
unto
went
out
to
see
the
daughters
of
the
Ge34:2
And
when
Shechem
the
son
of
Hamor
the
Hivite,
prince
of
the
saw
he
took
and
lay
with
and
defiled
her
.
Ge34:3
And
his
soul
clave
unto
Dinah
the
daughter
of
and
he
loved
the
and
spake
kindly
unto
the
Ge34:4
And
Shechem
spake
unto
his
father
Hamor,
Get
me
this
damsel
to
Ge34:5
And
Jacob
heard
that
he
had
defiled
Dinah
his
now
his
sons
were
with
his
cattle
in
the
and
Jacob
held
his
p
eace
until
they
were
Ge34:6
And
Hamor
the
father
of
Shechem
went
out
unto
Jacob
to
commune
with
Ge34:7
And
the
sons
of
Jacob
came
out
of
the
field
when
they
heard
and
the
men
were
and
they
were
very
because
he
had
wrought
folly
in
Israel
in
lying
with
Jacob's
which
thing
ought
not
to
be
Ge34:8
And
Hamor
communed
with
The
soul
of
my
son
Shechem
longeth
for
your
I
pray
you
give
her
him
to
Ge34:9
And
make
ye
marriages
with
and
give
your
daughters
unto
and
take
our
daughters
unto
Ge34:10
And
ye
shall
dwell
with
and
the
land
shall
be
before
dwell
and
trade
ye
and
get
you
possessions
Ge34:11
And
Shechem
said
unto
her
father
and
unto
her
Let
me
find
grace
in
your
and
what
ye
shall
say
unto
me
I
wil
l
Ge34:12
Ask
me
never
so
much
dowry
and
and
I
will
give
according
as
ye
shall
say
unto
but
give
me
the
damsel
to
Ge34:13
And
the
sons
of
Jacob
answered
Shechem
and
Hamor
his
father
and
because
he
had
defiled
Dinah
their
siste
r:
Ge34:14
And
they
said
unto
We
cannot
do
this
to
give
our
sister
to
one
that
is
for
that
were
a
reproach
unto
Ge34:15
But
in
this
will
we
consent
unto
If
ye
will
be
as
we
that
every
male
of
you
be
Ge34:16
Then
will
we
give
our
daughters
unto
and
we
will
take
your
daughters
to
and
we
will
dwell
with
and
we
will
be
come
one
Ge34:17
But
if
ye
will
not
hearken
unto
to
be
then
will
we
take
our
and
we
will
be
Ge34:18
And
their
words
pleased
Hamor,
and
Shechem
Hamor's
Ge34:19
And
the
young
man
deferred
not
to
do
the
because
he
had
delight
in
Jacob's
and
he
was
more
honourable
than
all
the
house
of
his
Ge34:20
And
Hamor
and
Shechem
his
son
came
unto
the
gate
of
their
and
communed
with
the
men
of
their
Ge34:21
These
men
are
peaceable
with
therefore
let
them
dwell
in
the
and
trade
for
the
it
is
large
enough
for
let
us
take
their
daughters
to
us
for
and
let
us
give
them
our
Ge34:22
Only
herein
will
the
men
consent
unto
us
for
to
dwell
with
to
be
one
if
every
male
among
us
be
as
they
are
Ge34:23
Shall
not
their
cattle
and
their
substance
and
every
beast
of
theirs
be
only
let
us
consent
unto
and
they
will
dwell
with
Ge34:24
And
unto
Hamor
and
unto
Shechem
his
son
hearkened
all
that
went
out
of
the
gate
of
his
and
every
male
was
circumcised
,
all
that
went
out
of
the
gate
of
his
Ge34:25
And
it
came
to
pass
on
the
third
when
they
were
that
two
of
the
sons
of
Simeon
and
Dinah's
brethren
,
took
each
man
his
and
came
upon
the
city
and
slew
all
the
Ge34:26
And
they
slew
Hamor
and
Shechem
his
son
with
the
edge
of
the
and
took
Dinah
out
of
Shechem's
and
went

The

no
hand
upon

might
rid
him
out

they
stript
Joseph
out

and
let

sell

returned
unto

he
rent

he
returned
unto
his
and

And
they
took
Joseph's

killed
a
kid
of

dipped

rose
up
to
comfort

refused

saw
there
a
daughter
of
a
certain
whose
name
was
Shuah;
and
he
took
and
went
in
unto
Ge38:3
And
she
and
bare
a

he
called
his
name
Er.
Ge38:4
And
she
conceived
and
bare
a

she
called
his
name
Onan.
Ge38:5
And
she
yet
again
and
bare
a
and
called
his
name
Shelah:
and
he
was
at
Chezib,
when
she
bare
Ge38:6
And
Judah
took
a
wife
for
Er
his
whose
name
was
Tamar.
Ge38:7
And
Er,
Judah's
was
wicked
in
the
sight
of
the
and
the
LORD
slew
Ge38:8
And
Judah
said
unto
Onan,
Go
in
unto
thy
brother's
and
marry
and
raise
up
seed
to
thy
Ge38:9
And
Onan
knew
that
the
seed
should
not
be
and
it
came
to
when
he
went
in
unto
his
brother's
that
he
spilled
it
on
the
lest
that
he
should
give
seed
to
his
Ge38:10
And
the
thing
which
he
did
displeased
the
wherefore
he
slew
him
Ge38:11
Then
said
Judah
to
Tamar
his
daughter
in
Remain
a
widow
at
thy
father's
till
Shelah
my
son
be
for
he

Lest
peradventure
he
die
as
his
brethren
And
Tamar
went
and
dwelt
in
her
father's
Ge38:12
And
in
process
of
time
the
daughter
of
Shuah
Judah's
wife
and
Judah
was

went
up
unto
his
sheepshearers
to
Timnath,
he
and
his
friend
Hirah

Ge38:13
And
it
was
told
Tamar,
Behold
thy
father
in
law
goeth
up
to
Timnath
to
shear
his

And
she
put
her
widow's
garments
off
from
and
covered
her
with
a
and
wrapped
and
sat
in
an
open
which
is
by
the
way
to
Timnath;
for
she
saw
that
Shelah
was
and
she
was
not
given
unto
him
to
Ge38:15
When
Judah
saw
he
thought
her
to
be
an

she
had
covered
her
Ge38:16
And
he
turned
unto
her
by
the
and
Go
I
pray
let
me
come
in
unto
(for
he
knew
not
that
she
was
hi
s
daughter
in
law.)
And
she
What
wilt
thou
give

thou
mayest

she

And
she

thine

And
he
gave
it
and
came
in
unto
and
she
conceived
by
Ge38:19
And
she
and
went
and
laid
by
her
vail
from

put
on
the
garments
of
her
Ge38:20
And
Judah
sent
the
kid
by
the
hand
of
his
friend
the
to
receive
his
pledge
from
the
woman's
but
he
found
her
Ge38:21
Then
he
asked
the
men
of
that
Where

the
way
And
they
There
was
no
harlot

And
he
returned
to

I
cannot
find

also
the
men
of
the
place
that
there
was
no
harlot
in

And
Judah
Let
her

it
came
to
pass
about
three
months
that
it
was
told

Judah
Bring

When
she
was

sent

Judah
acknowledged

it
came
to
pass
in
the
time
of
her
twins

in

And
it
came
to
when
she
travailed,
that
the

the
midwife

And
it
came
to

he
drew

she
How

this
breach

upon
therefore
his
name
was
called
Pharez.
Ge38:30
And
afterward
came
out
his
that
had
the
scarlet
thread
upon
his
and
his
name
was
called
Zarah.
Ge39:1
And
Joseph
was
brought
down
to
and
an
officer
of
captain
of
the
an
bought
him
of
the
hands
of
the
Ishmeelites,
which
had
brought
him
down
Ge39:2
And
the
LORD
was
with
and
he
was
a
prosperous
and
he
was
in
the
house
of
his
master
the
Ge39:3
And
his
master
saw
that
the
LORD
was
with
and
that
the
LORD
made
all
that
he
did
to
prosper
in
his
Ge39:4
And
Joseph
found
grace
in
his
and
he
served
and
he
made
him
overseer
over
his
and
all
that
he
had
he
put
into
his
Ge39:5
And
it
came
to
pass
from
the
time
that
he
had
made
him
overseer
in
his
and
over
all
that
he
that
the
LORD
blesse
d
the
Egyptian's
house
for
Joseph's
and
the
blessing
of
the
LORD
was
upon
all
that
he
had
in
the
and
in
the
Ge39:6
And
he
left
all
that
he
had
in
Joseph's
and
he
knew
not
ought
he
save
the
bread
which
he
did
And
Joseph
was
a
goodly
and
well
Ge39:7
And
it
came
to
pass
after
these
that
his
master's
wife
cast
her
eyes
upon
and
she
Lie
with
Ge39:8
But
he
and
said
unto
his
master's
my
master
wotteth
not
what
is
with
me
in
the
and
he
hath
com
mitted
all
that
he
hath
to
my
Ge39:9
There
is
none
greater
in
this
house
than
neither
hath
he
kept
back
any
thing
from
me
but
because
thou
art
his
how
then
can
I
do
this
great
and
sin
against
Ge39:10
And
it
came
to
as
she
spake
to
Joseph
day
by
that
he
hearkened
not
unto
to
lie
by
or
to
be
with
Ge39:11
And
it
came
to
pass
about
this
that
Joseph
went
into
the
house
to
do
his
and
there
was
none
of
the
men
of
t
he
house
there
Ge39:12
And
she
caught
him
by
his
Lie
with
and
he
left
his
garment
in
her
and
and
got
him
Ge39:13
And
it
came
to
when
she
saw
that
he
had
left
his
garment
in
her
and
was
fled
Ge39:14
That
she
called
unto
the
men
of
her
and
spake
unto
he
hath
brought
in
an
Hebrew
unto
us
to
mock
u
s;
he
came
in
unto
me
to
lie
with
and
I
cried
with
a
loud
Ge39:15
And
it
came
to
when
he
heard
that
I
lifted
up
my
voice
and
that
he
left
his
garment
with
and
and
got
him
Ge39:16
And
she
laid
up
his
garment
by
until
his
lord
came
Ge39:17
And
she
spake
unto
him
according
to
these
The
Hebrew
which
thou
hast
brought
unto
came
in
unto
me
to
mock
Ge39:18
And
it
came
to
as
I
lifted
up
my
voice
and
that
he
left
his
garment
with
and
fled
Ge39:19
And
it
came
to
when
his
master
heard
the
words
of
his
which
she
spake
unto
After
this
manner
did
t
hy
servant
to
that
his
wrath
was
Ge39:20
And
Joseph's
master
took
and
put
him
into
the
a
place
where
the
king's
prisoners
were
and
he
was
there
in
the
Ge39:21
But
the
LORD
was
with
and
shewed
him
and
gave
him
favour
in
the
sight
of
the
keeper
of
the
Ge39:22
And
the
keeper
of
the
prison
committed
to
Joseph's
hand
all
the
prisoners
that
were
in
the
and
whatsoever
they
did
he
was
the
doer
of
Ge39:23
The
keeper
of
the
prison
looked
not
to
any
thing
that
was
under
his
because
the
LORD
was
with
and
that
which
he
the
LORD
made
it
to
Ge40:1
And
it
came
to
pass
after
these
that
the
butler
of
the
king
of
Egypt
and
his
baker
had
offended
their
lord
the
king
of
Ge40:2
And
Pharaoh
was
wroth
against
two
of
his
against
the
chief
of
the
and
against
the
chief
of
the
Ge40:3
And
he
put
them
in
ward
in
the
house
of
the
captain
of
the
into
the
the
place
where
Joseph
was
Ge40:4
And
the
captain
of
the
guard
charged
Joseph
with
and
he
served
and
they
continued
a
season
in
Ge40:5
And
they
dreamed
a
dream
both
of
each
man
his
dream
in
one
each
man
according
to
the
interpretation
of
his
drea
m,
the
butler
and
the
baker
of
the
king
of
which
were
bound
in
the
Ge40:6
And
Joseph
came
in
unto
them
in
the
and
looked
upon
they
were
Ge40:7
And
he
asked
Pharaoh's
officers
that
were
with
him
in
the
ward
of
his
lord's
Wherefore
look
ye
so
sadly
to
da
y?
Ge40:8
And
they
said
unto
We
have
dreamed
a
and
there
is
no
interpreter
of
And
Joseph
said
unto
Do
not
interp
retations
belong
to
tell
me
I
pray
Ge40:9
And
the
chief
butler
told
his
dream
to
and
said
to
In
my
a
vine
was
before
Ge40:10
And
in
the
vine
were
three
and
it
was
as
though
it
and
her
blossoms
shot
and
the
clusters
thereof
brought
forth
ripe
Ge40:11
And
Pharaoh's
cup
was
in
my
and
I
took
the
and
pressed
them
into
Pharaoh's
and
I
gave
the
cup
into
Phara
oh's
Ge40:12
And
Joseph
said
unto
This
is
the
interpretation
of
The
three
branches
are
three
Ge40:13
Yet
within
three
days
shall
Pharaoh
lift
up
thine
and
restore
thee
unto
thy
and
thou
shalt
deliver
Pharaoh's
c
up
into
his
after
the
former
manner
when
thou
wast
his
Ge40:14
But
think
on
me
when
it
shall
be
well
with
and
shew
I
pray
unto
and
make
mention
of
me
unto
Phara
and
bring
me
out
of
this
Ge40:15
For
indeed
I
was
stolen
away
out
of
the
land
of
the
and
here
also
have
I
done
nothing
that
they
should
put
me
into
the
Ge40:16
When
the
chief
baker
saw
that
the
interpretation
was
he
said
unto
I
also
was
in
my
I
had
three
white
baskets
on
my
Ge40:17
And
in
the
uppermost
basket
there
was
of
all
manner
of
bakemeats
for
and
the
birds
did
eat
them
out
of
the
basket
upon
my
Ge40:18
And
Joseph
answered
and
This
is
the
interpretation
The
three
baskets
are
three
Ge40:19
Yet
within
three
days
shall
Pharaoh
lift
up
thy
head
from
off
and
shall
hang
thee
on
a
and
the
birds
shall
eat
thy
flesh
from
off
Ge40:20
And
it
came
to
pass
the
third
which
was
Pharaoh's
that
he
made
a
feast
unto
all
his
and
he
lifted
up
the
head
of
the
chief
butler
and
of
the
chief
baker
among
his
Ge40:21
And
he
restored
the
chief
butler
unto
his
butlership
and
he
gave
the
cup
into
Pharaoh's
Ge40:22
But
he
hanged
the
chief
as
Joseph
had
interpreted
to
Ge40:23
Yet
did
not
the
chief
butler
remember
but
forgat
Ge41:1
And
it
came
to
pass
at
the
end
of
two
full
that
Pharaoh
he
stood
by
the
Ge41:2
there
came
up
out
of
the
river
seven
well
favoured
kine
and
fatfleshed;
and
they
fed
in
a
Ge41:3
seven
other
kine
came
up
after
them
out
of
the
ill
favoured
and
leanfleshed;
and
stood
by
the
other
kine
upon
the
brink
of
the
Ge41:4
And
the
ill
favoured
and
leanfleshed
kine
did
eat
up
the
seven
well
favoured
and
fat
So
Pharaoh
Ge41:5
And
he
slept
and
dreamed
the
second
seven
ears
of
corn
came
up
upon
one
rank
and
Ge41:6
seven
thin
ears
and
blasted
with
the
east
wind
sprung
up
after
Ge41:7
And
the
seven
thin
ears
devoured
the
seven
rank
and
full
And
Pharaoh
it
was
a
Ge41:8
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
morning
that
his
spirit
was
and
he
sent
and
called
for
all
the
magicians
of
and
all
the
wise
men
and
Pharaoh
told
them
his
but
there
was
none
that
could
interpret
them
unto
Ge41:9
Then
spake
the
chief
butler
unto
I
do
remember
my
faults
this
Ge41:10
Pharaoh
was
wroth
with
his
and
put
me
in
ward
in
the
captain
of
the
guard's
both
me
and
the
chief
Ge41:11
And
we
dreamed
a
dream
in
one
I
and
we
dreamed
each
man
according
to
the
interpretation
of
his
Ge41:12
And
there
was
there
with
us
a
young
an
servant
to
the
captain
of
the
and
we
told
and
he
interprete
d
to
us
our
to
each
man
according
to
his
dream
he
did
Ge41:13
And
it
came
to
as
he
interpreted
to
so
it
me
he
restored
unto
mine
and
him
he
Ge41:14
Then
Pharaoh
sent
and
called
and
they
brought
him
hastily
out
of
the
and
he
shaved
and
changed
hi
s
and
came
in
unto
Ge41:15
And
Pharaoh
said
unto
I
have
dreamed
a
and
there
is
none
that
can
interpret
and
I
have
heard
say
of
thee
,
that
thou
canst
understand
a
dream
to
interpret
Ge41:16
And
Joseph
answered
It
is
not
in
God
shall
give
Pharaoh
an
answer
of
Ge41:17
And
Pharaoh
said
unto
In
my
I
stood
upon
the
bank
of
the
Ge41:18
there
came
up
out
of
the
river
seven
fatfleshed
and
well
and
they
fed
in
a
Ge41:19
seven
other
kine
came
up
after
poor
and
very
ill
favoured
and
leanfleshed,
such
as
I
never
saw
in
all
th
e
land
of
Egypt
for
Ge41:20
And
the
lean
and
the
ill
favoured
kine
did
eat
up
the
first
seven
fat
Ge41:21
And
when
they
had
eaten
them
it
could
not
be
known
that
they
had
eaten
but
they
were
still
ill
as
at
th
e
So
I
Ge41:22
And
I
saw
in
my
seven
ears
came
up
in
one
full
and
Ge41:23
seven
and
blasted
with
the
east
sprung
up
after
Ge41:24
And
the
thin
ears
devoured
the
seven
good
and
I
told
this
unto
the
but
there
was
none
that
could
declare
i
t
to
Ge41:25
And
Joseph
said
unto
The
dream
of
Pharaoh
is
God
hath
shewed
Pharaoh
what
he
is
about
to
Ge41:26
The
seven
good
kine
are
seven
and
the
seven
good
ears
are
seven
the
dream
is
Ge41:27
And
the
seven
thin
and
ill
favoured
kine
that
came
up
after
them
are
seven
and
the
seven
empty
ears
blasted
with
the
east
wind
shall
be
seven
years
of
Ge41:28
This
is
the
thing
which
I
have
spoken
unto
What
God
is
about
to
do
he
sheweth
unto
Ge41:29
there
come
seven
years
of
great
plenty
throughout
all
the
land
of
Ge41:30
And
there
shall
arise
after
them
seven
years
of
and
all
the
plenty
shall
be
forgotten
in
the
land
of
and
the
famine
shall
consume
the
Ge41:31
And
the
plenty
shall
not
be
known
in
the
land
by
reason
of
that
famine
for
it
shall
be
very
Ge41:32
And
for
that
the
dream
was
doubled
unto
Pharaoh
it
is
because
the
thing
is
established
by
and
God
will
shortly
bring
it
to
Ge41:33
Now
therefore
let
Pharaoh
look
out
a
man
discreet
and
and
set
him
over
the
land
of
Ge41:34
Let
Pharaoh

And
the
thing
was
good

And
Pharaoh
said
unto
his
Can

And
Pharaoh
said
unto
Forasmuch
as
God
hath
shewed
thee
all
there
is
none
so
discreet
and
wise
as
thou
Ge41:40
Thou
shalt
be

according
unto
thy
word
shall
all
my
people
be
only
in

be
greater
than

And
Pharaoh
said
unto
I
have
set
thee
over
all
the
land
of
Ge41:42
And
Pharaoh
took
off
his
ring
from
his

put
it
upon
Joseph's

arrayed
him
in
vestures
of
fine
and
put
a
gold

And
he
made

he
made

And
Pharaoh
said
unto
I

without
thee
shall
no

his
hand
or

Ge41:45
And
Pharaoh
called
Joseph's
name
Zaphnathpaaneah;
and
he
gave
him
to
wife
Asenath
the
daughter
of
Potipherah
priest
of
And
Joseph
went
out
over
all
the
land
of
Ge41:46
And
Joseph
was
thirty
years
old
when
he
stood
before
Pharaoh
king
of
And
Joseph
went
out
from
the
presence
of
Pharao
h,
and
went
throughout
all
the
land
of
Ge41:47
And
in
the
seven
plenteous
years
the
earth
brought
forth
by
Ge41:48
And
he
gathered
up
all
the
food
of
the
seven
which
were
in
the
land
of
and
laid
up
the
food
in
the
th

food
of
the
which
was
round
about
every
laid
he
up
in
the
Ge41:49
And
Joseph
gathered
corn
as
the
sand
of
the
very
until
he
left
for
it
was
without
Ge41:50
And
unto
Joseph
were
born
two
sons
before
the
years
of
famine
which
Asenath
the
daughter
of
Potipherah
priest
of
On
b
are
unto
Ge41:51
And
Joseph
called
the
name
of
the
firstborn
For
said
hath
made
me
forget
all
my
and
all
my
s
Ge41:52
And
the
name
of
the
second
called
he
For
God
hath
caused
me
to
be
fruitful
in
the
land
of
my
Ge41:53
And
the
seven
years
of
that
was
in
the
land
of
were
Ge41:54
And
the
seven
years
of
dearth
began
to
according
as
Joseph
had
and
the
dearth
was
in
all
but
in
all
the
land
of
Egypt
there
was
Ge41:55
And
when
all
the
land
of
Egypt
was
the
people
cried
to
Pharaoh
for
and
Pharaoh
said
unto
all
the
Egyptians
,
Go
unto
what
he
saith
to
Ge41:56
And
the
famine
was
over
all
the
face
of
the
And
Joseph
opened
all
the
and
sold
unto
the
and
the
famine
waxed
sore
in
the
land
of
Ge41:57
And
all
countries
came
into
Egypt
to
Joseph
for
to
buy
because
that
the
famine
was
so
sore
in
all
Ge42:1
Now
when
Jacob
saw
that
there
was
corn
in
Jacob
said
unto
his
Why
do
ye
look
one
upon
Ge42:2
And
he
I
have
heard
that
there
is
corn
in
get
you
down
and
buy
for
us
from
that
we
may
and
not
Ge42:3
And
Joseph's
ten
brethren
went
down
to
buy
corn
in
Ge42:4
But
Joseph's
Jacob
sent
not
with
his
for
he
Lest
peradventure
mischief
befall
Ge42:5
And
the
sons
of
Israel
came
to
buy
corn
among
those
that
for
the
famine
was
in
the
land
of
Ge42:6
And
Joseph
was
the
governor
over
the
and
he
it
was
that
sold
to
all
the
people
of
the
and
Joseph's
brethren
came
,
and
bowed
down
themselves
before
him
with
their
faces
to
the
Ge42:7
And
Joseph
saw
his
and
he
knew
but
made
himself
strange
unto
and
spake
roughly
unto
and
he
said
unto
Whence
come
And
they
From
the
land
of
Canaan
to
buy
Ge42:8
And
Joseph
knew
his
but
they
knew
not
Ge42:9
And
Joseph
remembered
the
dreams
which
he
dreamed
of
and
said
unto
Ye
are
to
see
the
nakedness
of
the
lan
d
ye
are
Ge42:10
And
they
said
unto
my
but
to
buy
food
are
thy
servants
Ge42:11
We
are
all
one
man's
we
are
true
thy
servants
are
no
Ge42:12
And
he
said
unto
but
to
see
the
nakedness
of
the
land
ye
are
Ge42:13
And
they
Thy
servants
are
twelve
the
sons
of
one
man
in
the
land
of
the
youngest
is
th
is
day
with
our
and
one
is
Ge42:14
And
Joseph
said
unto
That
is
it
that
I
spake
unto
Ye
are
Ge42:15
Hereby
ye
shall
be
By
the
life
of
Pharaoh
ye
shall
not
go
forth
except
your
youngest
brother
come
Ge42:16
Send
one
of
and
let
him
fetch
your
and
ye
shall
be
kept
in
that
your
words
may
be
whether
the
re
be
any
truth
in
or
else
by
the
life
of
Pharaoh
surely
ye
are
Ge42:17
And
he
put
them
all
together
into
ward
three
Ge42:18
And
Joseph
said
unto
them
the
third
This
and
for
I
fear
Ge42:19
If
ye
be
true
let
one
of
your
brethren
be
bound
in
the
house
of
your
go
carry
corn
for
the
famine
of
your
Ge42:20
But
bring
your
youngest
brother
unto
so
shall
your
words
be
and
ye
shall
not
And
they
did
Ge42:21
And
they
said
one
to
We
are
verily
guilty
concerning
our
in
that
we
saw
the
anguish
of
his
when
he
besought
and
we
would
not
therefore
is
this
distress
come
upon
Ge42:22
And
Reuben
answered
Spake
I
not
unto
Do
not
sin
against
the
and
ye
would
not
theref
also
his
blood
is
Ge42:23
And
they
knew
not
that
Joseph
understood
for
he
spake
unto
them
by
an
Ge42:24
And
he
turned
himself
about
from
and
and
returned
to
them
and
communed
with
and
took
from
them
Sim
and
bound
him
before
their
Ge42:25
Then
Joseph
commanded
to
fill
their
sacks
with
and
to
restore
every
man's
money
into
his
and
to
give
them
provi
sion
for
the
and
thus
did
he
unto
Ge42:26
And
they
laded
their
asses
with
the
and
departed
Ge42:27
And
as
one
of
them
opened
his
sack
to
give
his
ass
provender
in
the
he
espied
his
it
was
in
his
sa
ck's
Ge42:28
And
he
said
unto
his
My
money
is
it
is
even
in
my
and
their
heart
failed
and
they
were
saying
one
to
What
is
this
that
God
hath
done
unto
Ge42:29
And
they
came
unto
Jacob
their
father
unto
the
land
of
and
told
him
all
that
befell
unto
Ge42:30
The
who
is
the
lord
of
the
spake
roughly
to
and
took
us
for
spies
of
the
Ge42:31
And
we
said
unto
We
are
true
we
are
no
Ge42:32
We
be
twelve
sons
of
our
one
is
and
the
youngest
is
this
day
with
our
father
in
the
land
of
Ge42:33
And
the
the
lord
of
the
said
unto
Hereby
shall
I
know
that
ye
are
true
leave
one
of
your
brethren
he
re
with
and
take
food
for
the
famine
of
your
and
be
Ge42:34
And
bring
your
youngest
brother
unto
then
shall
I
know
that
ye
are
no
but
that
ye
are
true
so
will
I
delive
r
you
your
and
ye
shall
traffick
in
the
Ge42:35
And
it
came
to
pass
as
they
emptied
their
every
man's
bundle
of
money
was
in
his
and
when
both
t
hey
and
their
father
saw
the
bundles
of
they
were
Ge42:36
And
Jacob
their
father
said
unto
Me
have
ye
bereaved
of
my
Joseph
is
and
Simeon
is
and
ye
will
ta
ke
Benjamin
all
these
things
are
against
Ge42:37
And
Reuben
spake
unto
his
Slay
my
two
if
I
bring
him
not
to
deliver
him
into
my
and
I
wil
l
bring
him
to
thee
Ge42:38
And
he
My
son
shall
not
go
down
with
for
his
brother
is
and
he
is
left
if
mischief
befall
him
by
th
e
way
in
the
which
ye
then
shall
ye
bring
down
my
gray
hairs
with
sorrow
to
the
Ge43:1
And
the
famine
was
sore
in
the
Ge43:2
And
it
came
to
when
they
had
eaten
up
the
corn
which
they
had
brought
out
of
their
father
said
unto
Go
ag
buy
us
a
little
Ge43:3
And
Judah
spake
unto
The
man
did
solemnly
protest
unto
Ye
shall
not
see
my
except
your
brothe
r
be
with
Ge43:4
If
thou
wilt
send
our
brother
with
we
will
go
down
and
buy
thee
Ge43:5
But
if
thou
wilt
not
send
we
will
not
go
for
the
man
said
unto
Ye
shall
not
see
my
except
your
brother
be
with
Ge43:6
And
Israel
Wherefore
dealt
ye
so
ill
with
as
to
tell
the
man
whether
ye
had
yet
a
Ge43:7
And
they
The
man
asked
us
straitly
of
our
and
of
our
Is
your
father
yet
have
ye
another
and
we
told
him
according
to
the
tenor
of
these
could
we
certainly
know
that
he
would
Bring
your
brother
down
?
Ge43:8
And
Judah
said
unto
Israel
his
Send
the
lad
with
and
we
will
arise
and
that
we
may
and
not
both
w
e,
and
and
also
our
little
Ge43:9
I
will
be
surety
for
of
my
hand
shalt
thou
require
if
I
bring
him
not
unto
and
set
him
before
then
let
me
bear
the
blame
for
Ge43:10
For
except
we
had
surely
now
we
had
returned
this
second
Ge43:11
And
their
father
Israel
said
unto
If
it
must
be
so
do
take
of
the
best
fruits
in
the
land
in
your
and
carry
down
the
man
a
a
little
and
a
little
and
and
Ge43:12
And
take
double
money
in
your
and
the
money
that
was
brought
again
in
the
mouth
of
your
carry
it
again
in
your
peradventure
it
was
an
Ge43:13
Take
also
your
and
go
again
unto
the
Ge43:14
And
God
Almighty
give
you
mercy
before
the
that
he
may
send
away
your
other
and
If
I
be
bereaved
of
my
I
am
Ge43:15
And
the
men
took
that
and
they
took
double
money
in
their
and
and
rose
and
went
down
to
and
stood
before
Ge43:16
And
when
Joseph
saw
Benjamin
with
he
said
to
the
ruler
of
his
Bring
these
men
and
and
make
for
these
men
shall
dine
with
me
at
Ge43:17
And
the
man
did
as
Joseph
and
the
man
brought
the
men
into
Joseph's
Ge43:18
And
the
men
were
because
they
were
brought
into
Joseph's
and
they
Because
of
the
money
that
was
return
ed
in
our
sacks
at
the
first
time
are
we
brought
that
he
may
seek
occasion
against
and
fall
upon
and
take
us
for
bondme
n,
and
our
Ge43:19
And
they
came
near
to
the
steward
of
Joseph's
and
they
communed
with
him
at
the
door
of
the
Ge43:20
And
O
we
came
indeed
down
at
the
first
time
to
buy
Ge43:21
And
it
came
to
when
we
came
to
the
that
we
opened
our
every
man's
money
was
in
the
mouth
of
his
our
money
in
full
and
we
have
brought
it
again
in
our
Ge43:22
And
other
money
have
we
brought
down
in
our
hands
to
buy
we
cannot
tell
who
put
our
money
in
our
Ge43:23
And
he
Peace
be
to
fear
your
and
the
God
of
your
hath
given
you
treasure
in
your
I
had
your
And
he
brought
Simeon
out
unto
Ge43:24
And
the
man
brought
the
men
into
Joseph's
and
gave
them
and
they
washed
their
and
he
gave
their
asses
p
rovender.
Ge43:25
And
they
made
ready
the
present
against
Joseph
came
at
for
they
heard
that
they
should
eat
bread
Ge43:26
And
when
Joseph
came
they
brought
him
the
present
which
was
in
their
hand
into
the
and
bowed
themselves
to
him
to
the
Ge43:27
And
he
asked
them
of
their
and
Is
your
father
the
old
man
of
whom
ye
Is
he
yet
Ge43:28
And
they
Thy
servant
our
father
is
in
good
he
is
yet
And
they
bowed
down
their
and
made
obe
isance.
Ge43:29
And
he
lifted
up
his
and
saw
his
brother
his
mother's
and
Is
this
your
younger
of
whom
ye
spake
unto
And
he
God
be
gracious
unto
my
Ge43:30
And
Joseph
made
for
his
bowels
did
yearn
upon
his
and
he
sought
where
to
and
he
entered
into
his
cham
ber,
and
wept
Ge43:31
And
he
washed
his
and
went
and
refrained
and
Set
on
Ge43:32
And
they
set
on
for
him
by
and
for
them
by
and
for
the
which
did
eat
with
by
themselve
s:
because
the
Egyptians
might
not
eat
bread
with
the
for
that
is
an
abomination
unto
the
Ge43:33
And
they
sat
before
the
firstborn
according
to
his
and
the
youngest
according
to
his
and
the
men
ma
rvelled
one
at
Ge43:34
And
he
took
and
sent
messes
unto
them
from
before
but
Benjamin's
mess
was
five
times
so
much
as
any
of
And
the
y
and
were
merry
with
Ge44:1
And
he
commanded
the
steward
of
his
Fill
the
men's
sacks
with
as
much
as
they
can
and
put
every
man's
money
in
his
sack's
Ge44:2
And
put
my
the
silver
in
the
sack's
mouth
of
the
and
his
corn
And
he
did
according
to
the
word
th
at
Joseph
had
Ge44:3
As
soon
as
the
morning
was
the
men
were
sent
they
and
their
Ge44:4
And
when
they
were
gone
out
of
the
and
not
yet
far
Joseph
said
unto
his
follow
after
the
and
wh
en
thou
dost
overtake
say
unto
Wherefore
have
ye
rewarded
evil
for
Ge44:5
Is
not
this
it
in
which
my
lord
drinketh,
and
whereby
indeed
he
divineth?
ye
have
done
evil
in
so
Ge44:6
And
he
overtook
and
he
spake
unto
them
these
same
Ge44:7
And
they
said
unto
Wherefore
saith
my
lord
these
God
forbid
that
thy
servants
should
do
according
to
this
Ge44:8
the
which
we
found
in
our
we
brought
again
unto
thee
out
of
the
land
of
how
then
shoul
d
we
steal
out
of
thy
lord's
house
silver
or
Ge44:9
With
whomsoever
of
thy
servants

be
both
let

and
we
also
will
be
my
lord's
bondmen.
Ge44:10
And
he
Now
also
let
it
be
according
unto
your
he
with
whom
it
is
found
shall
be
my
and
ye
shall
be
bl

Ge44:11
Then
they
speedily
took
down
every
man
his
sack
to
the
and
opened
every
man
his
Ge44:12
And
he
and
began
at
the
and
left
at
the
and

Then

We

And
thou
saidst
unto

down
unto
that
I
may
set
mine
eyes
upon

And
we
said
unto
my
The

cannot
leave

if
he
should
leave

his

would
Ge44:23
And
thou
saidst
unto
thy
Except
your
youngest

come
down
with

no
Ge44:24
And
it
came
to
pass
when
we
came
up
unto
thy
servant
my
we
told
him
the
words
of
my
Ge44:25
And
our
father
Go
and
buy
us
a
little
Ge44:26
And
we
We
cannot
go
if
our

will
we
go

may
not
see
the

except
our
youngest

And
thy
servant
my

said
unto
Ye
know
that
my
wife
bare
me
two

And
the
one
went
out
from

I
Surely
he
is
torn
in

not
Ge44:29
And
if
ye
take
this
also
from

mischief
befall
ye
shall
bring
down
my
gray
hairs
with
sorrow
to

Ge44:30
Now
therefore
when
I
come
to

my
and

be
not
with
seeing
that
his
life
is
bound
up
in

Ge44:31
It
shall
come
to
when
he
seeth
that
the

is
not
with
that
he
will
and
thy
servants
shall
bring
down
the
g
ray
hairs
of
thy
servant
our
father
with
sorrow
to

Ge44:32
For
thy
servant
became
surety
for
the

unto
my
If
I
bring
him
not
unto

I
shall
bear
the
blame
to
my
father
for

Now
I
pray
let
thy
servant
abide
instead
of
the
lad
a
bondman
to
my
and
let
the
lad
go
up
with
his
b

Ge44:34
For
how
shall
I
go
up
to

be
not
with

peradventure
I
see
the
evil
that

And
Joseph
made
it

unto
this
that
Pharaoh

Ge47:27
And
Israel
dwelt
in
the
land
of
in
the
country
of

they
had
possessions
and

And
Jacob
lived

seventeen
so
the
whole
age
of
Jacob
was

And
the
time
drew
nigh
that
Israel
must

he
called
his
son
and
said
unto
If

But
I

And
he
I
wil

And
he
Swear
unto
And
he
sware
unto
And
Israel
bowed
himself
upon
the
bed's
Ge48:1
And
it
came
to
pass
after
these
that
one
told
thy
father

he
took
with
him
his
two
Manasseh
and

And
one
told
and
thy
son
Joseph
cometh

Israel
strengthened
and
sat
upon

Ge48:3
And
Jacob
said
unto
God
Almighty
appeared
unto
me
at
Luz
in
the
land
of

blessed
Ge48:4
And
said
unto
I

And
now

were
born

thee
in

before
I
came

thee
into

And

And
as
for
when
I
came
from
Padan,
Rachel
died
by
me
in
the
land
of
Canaan
in
the
when
yet
there
was
but
a
little
w

to
come
unto
Ephrath:
and
I
buried
her
there
in
the
way
of
Ephrath;
the

Ge48:8
And
Israel
beheld
Joseph's
and
Who
are

And
Joseph
said
unto
his
They

God
hath
given

And
he
Bring

Now
the
eyes
of
Israel
were
dim
for
so
that
he
could
not
And
he
brought
them
near
unto

he
kissed
a

embraced
Ge48:11
And
Israel
said
unto
I
had
not
thought
to
see
thy
God
hath
shewed
me
also
thy

And
Joseph
brought
them
out
from
between
his
and
he
bowed
himself
with
his
face
to
the
Ge48:13
And
Joseph
took
them
Ephraim
in
his
right
hand
toward
Israel's
left
and
Manasseh
in
his
left
hand
toward
Israel
's
right
and
brought
them
near
unto
Ge48:14
And
Israel
stretched
out
his
right

laid
it
upon
Ephraim's
who
was
the

his
left
hand
upon
Manas

And
he
blessed
and
before
whom
my

Abraham
and
Isaac
did
the

fed
me

let
them
grow
into
a
multitude
in
the
midst
of

And
when
Joseph
saw
that
his
father
laid
his
right
hand
upon
the
head
of
it
displeased
and
he
held
up
his
fat
her's
to
remove
it
from
Ephraim's
head
unto
Manasseh's
Ge48:18
And
Joseph
said
unto
his
Not

And
his
father

truly
his
younger
brother
shall
be
greater

his
seed
shall
become
a

And
he
blessed
them
that
In
thee
shall
Israel
God
make
thee
as
Ephraim
and
as

he
set
Ephraim
before
Ge48:21
And
Israel
said
unto
I

bring
you

Moreover
I

Abraham
bought
with

There
they
buried

The
purchase
of

gathered
up
his

And
Joseph
fell
upon

wept
upon

kissed
Ge50:2
And
Joseph
commanded
his
servants
the
physicians
to
embalm
his
and
the
physicians
embalmed
Ge50:3
And
forty
days
were
fulfilled
for
for
so
are
fulfilled
the
days
of
those
which
are
embalmed:
and
the
Egyptians
mourned
for
him
threescore
and
ten
Ge50:4
And
when
the
days
of
his
mourning
were
Joseph
spake
unto
the
house
of
If
now
I
have
found
grace
in

I
pray
in
the
ears
of
Ge50:5
My

I
will
come
Ge50:6
And
Pharaoh
Go
and
bury
thy
according
as
he
made
thee
Ge50:7
And
Joseph
went
up
to
bury
his
and
with
him
went
up
all
the
servants
of
the
elders
of
his
and
all
th
e
elders
of
the
land
of
Ge50:8
And
all
the
house
of
and
his
and
his
father's
only
their
little
and
their
and
their
h
erds,
they
left
in
the
land
of
Ge50:9
And
there
went
up
with
him
both
chariots
and
and
it
was
a
very
great
Ge50:10
And
they
came
to
the
threshingfloor
of
Atad,
which
is
beyond
and
there
they
mourned
with
a
great
and
very
sore
lame
ntation:
and
he
made
a
mourning
for
his
father
seven
Ge50:11
And
when
the
inhabitants
of
the
the
Canaanites,
saw
the
mourning
in
the
floor
of
Atad,
they
This
is
a
grievous
mourning
to
the
wherefore
the
name
of
it
was
called
Abelmizraim,
which
is
beyond
Ge50:12
And
his
sons
did
unto
him
according
as
he
commanded
Ge50:13
For
his
sons
carried
him
into
the
land
of
and
buried
him
in
the
cave
of
the
field
of
Machpelah,
which
Abraham
bough
t
with
the
field
for
a
possession
of
a
buryingplace
of
Ephron
the
before
Mamre.
Ge50:14
And
Joseph
returned
into
and
his
and
all
that
went
up
with
him
to
bury
his
after
he
had
buried
his
Ge50:15
And
when
Joseph's
brethren
saw
that
their
father
was
they
Joseph
will
peradventure
hate
and
will
certainly
requite
us
all
the
evil
which
we
did
unto
Ge50:16
And
they
sent
a
messenger
unto
Thy
father

command
before
he
Ge50:17
So
shall
ye
say
unto
I
pray
thee
the
trespass
of

their
for
they
did
unto
thee
and
we
pray
forgive
the
trespass
of
the
servants
of

God
of

And
Joseph
wept
when
they
spake
unto
hi
m.
Ge50:18
And
his
brethren
also
went
and
fell
down
before
his
and
they
we
be
thy
Ge50:19
And
Joseph
said
unto
Fear
for
am
I
in
the
place
of
Ge50:20
But
as
for
ye
thought
evil
against
but
God
meant
it
unto
to
bring
to
as
it
is
this
to
save
much
p

Ge50:21
Now
therefore
fear
ye
I
will
nourish
and
your
little
And
he
comforted
and
spake
kindly
unto
Ge50:22
And
Joseph
dwelt
in
and
his
father's
and
Joseph
lived
an
hundred
and
ten
Ge50:23
And
Joseph
saw
Ephraim's
children
of
the
third
the
children
also
of
Machir
the
son
of
Manasseh
were
brought
up
upon
Joseph's
Ge50:24
And
Joseph
said
unto
his
I
and
God
will
surely
visit
and
bring
you
out
of
this
land
unto
the
land
which
he
sware
to
to
and
to
Ge50:25
And
Joseph
took
an
oath
of
the
children
of
God
will
surely
visit
and
ye
shall
carry
up
my
bones
from
h
ence.
Ge50:26
So
Joseph
being
an
hundred
and
ten
years
and
they
embalmed
and
he
was
put
in
a
coffin
in
Exo1:1
Now
these
are
the
names
of
the
children
of
which
came
into
every
man
and
his
household
came
with
Exo1:2
and
Exo1:3
and
Exo1:4
and
and
Exo1:5
And
all
the
souls
that
came
out
of
the
loins
of
Jacob
were
seventy
for
Joseph
was
in
Egypt
Exo1:6
And
Joseph
and
all
his
and
all
that
Exo1:7
And
the
children
of
Israel
were
and
increased
and
and
waxed
exceeding
and
the
land
was
filled
with
Exo1:8
Now
there
arose
up
a
new
king
over
which
knew
not
Exo1:9
And
he
said
unto
his
the
people
of
the
children
of
Israel
are
more
and
mightier
than
Exo1:10
Come
let
us
deal
wisely
with
lest
they
and
it
come
to
when
there
falleth
out
any
they
join
also
unto
our
and
fight
against
and
so
get
them
up
out
of
the
Exo1:11
Therefore
they
did
set
over
them
taskmasters
to
afflict
them
with
their
And
they
built
for
Pharaoh
treasure
cities
,
Pithom
and
Raamses.
Exo1:12
But
the
more
they
afflicted
the
more
they
multiplied
and
And
they
were
grieved
because
of
the
children
of
Israe
l.
Exo1:13
And
the
Egyptians
made
the
children
of
Israel
to
serve
with
Exo1:14
And
they
made
their
lives
bitter
with
hard
in
morter,
and
in
and
in
all
manner
of
service
in
the
all
their
wherein
they
made
them
was
with
Exo1:15
And
the
king
of
Egypt
spake
to
the
Hebrew
of

the
name
of
the
one
was
Shiphrah,
and
the
name

But
the
midwives
feared
and
did
not
as
the
king
of
Egypt
commanded
but
saved
the
men
children
Exo1:18
And
the
king
of
Egypt
called
for
the
and
said
unto
Why
have
ye
done
this
and
have
saved
the
men

And
the
midwives
said
unto
Because
the
Hebrew
women
are
not
as
the
Egyptian
for
they
are
and
are
de
livered
ere
the
midwives
come
in
unto
Exo1:20
Therefore
God
dealt
well
with
the
and
the
people
and
waxed
very

And
it
came
to
because
the
midwives
feared
that
he
made

And
Pharaoh
charged
all
his

And
there
went
a
man
of
the
house
of

took
to
wife
a
daughter
of
Exo2:2
And
the
woman

when
she
saw
him
that
he
was
a
goodly
she
hid
him

And
when
she
could
not
longer
hide
she
took
for
him
an
ark
of
bulrushes,
and
daubed
it
with
slime
and
with
and
p

the
child
and
she
laid
it
in
the
flags
by
the
river's
Exo2:4
And
his
sister
stood
afar
to
wit
what
would
be
done
to
Exo2:5
And
the
daughter
of
Pharaoh
came
down
to
wash
herself
at
the
and
her
maidens
walked
along
by
the
river's
and
wh

she
saw
the
ark
among

sent
her
maid
to
fetch
Exo2:6
And
when
she
had
opened
she
saw
the
the
babe
And
she
had
compassion
on
and
This
is
one
of
the
Exo2:7
Then
said
his
sister
to
Pharaoh's
Shall
I
go
and
call
to
thee
a
nurse
of
the
Hebrew
that
she
may
nurse
the
child
for
Exo2:8
And
Pharaoh's
daughter
said
to
And
the
maid
went
and
called
the
child's
Exo2:9
And
Pharaoh's
daughter
said
unto
Take
this

it
for

I
will
give
thee

the
wom

took

nursed
Exo2:10
And
the
child
and
she
brought
him
unto
Pharaoh's
and
he
became
her
And
she
called
his
name
and
she
Because
I
drew
him
out
of
the
Exo2:11
And
it
came
to
pass
in
those
when
Moses
was
that
he
went
out
unto
his
and
looked
on
their
a
nd
he
spied
an
Egyptian
smiting
an
one
of
his
Exo2:12
And
he
looked
this
way
and
that
and
when
he
saw
that
there
was
no
he
slew
the
and
hid
him
in
the
Exo2:13
And
when
he
went
out
the
second
two
men
of
the
Hebrews
strove
and
he
said
to
him
that
did
the
Wherefore
smitest
thou
thy
Exo2:14
And
he
Who
made
thee
a
prince
and
a
judge
over
intendest
thou
to
kill
as
thou
killedst
the
And
Mose
s
and
Surely
this
thing
is
Exo2:15
Now
when
Pharaoh
heard
this
he
sought
to
slay
But
Moses
fled
from
the
face
of
and
dwelt
in
the
land
of
and
he
sat
down
by
a
Exo2:16
Now
the
priest
of
Midian
had
seven
and
they
came
and
drew
and
filled
the
troughs
to
water
their
father's
Exo2:17
And
the
shepherds
came
and
drove
them
but
Moses
stood
up
and
helped
and
watered
their
Exo2:18
And
when
they
came
to
Reuel
their
he
How
is
it
that
ye
are
come
so
soon
to
Exo2:19
And
they
An
Egyptian
delivered
us
out
of
the
hand
of
the
and
also
drew
water
enough
for
and
watered
th
e
Exo2:20
And
he
said
unto
his
And
where
is
why
is
it
that
ye
have
left
the
call
that
he
may
eat
Exo2:21
And
Moses
was
content
to
dwell
with
the
and
he
gave
Moses
Zipporah
his
Exo2:22
And
she
bare
him
a
and
he
called
his
name
Gershom:
for
he
I
have
been
a
stranger
in
a
strange
Exo2:23
And
it
came
to
pass
in
process
of
that
the
king
of
Egypt
and
the
children
of
Israel
sighed
by
reason
of
the
bon
dage,
and
they
and
their
cry
came
up
unto
God
by
reason
of
the
Exo2:24
And
God
heard
their
and
God
remembered
his
covenant
with
with
and
with
Exo2:25
And
God
looked
upon
the
children
of
and
God
had
respect
unto
Exo3:1
Now
Moses
kept
the
flock
of
Jethro
his
father
in
the
priest
of
and
he
led
the
flock
to
the
backside
of
the
dese
rt,
and
came
to
the
mountain
of
even
to
Exo3:2
And
the
angel
of
the
LORD
appeared
unto
him
in
a
flame
of
fire
out
of
the
midst
of
a
and
he
the
b
ush
burned
with
and
the
bush
was
not
Exo3:3
And
Moses
I
will
now
turn
and
see
this
great
why
the
bush
is
not
Exo3:4
And
when
the
LORD
saw
that
he
turned
aside
to
God
called
unto
him
out
of
the
midst
of
the
and
And
he
Here
am
Exo3:5
And
he
Draw
not
nigh
put
off
thy
shoes
from
off
thy
for
the
place
whereon
thou
standest
is
holy
Exo3:6
Moreover
he
I
am
the
God
of
thy
the
God
of
the
God
of
and
the
God
of
And
Moses
hid
his
for
he
was
afraid
to
look
upon
Exo3:7
And
the
LORD
I
have
surely
seen
the
affliction
of
my
people
which
are
in
and
have
heard
their
cry
by
reason
of
their
taskmasters;
for
I
know
their
Exo3:8
And
I
am
come
down
to
deliver
them
out
of
the
hand
of
the
and
to
bring
them
up
out
of
that
land
unto
a
good
land
and
a
unto
a
land
flowing
with
milk
and
unto
the
place
of
the
Canaanites,
and
the
Hittites,
and
the
Amorites,
and
the
Perizzites,
and
the
Hivites,
and
the
Jebusites.
Exo3:9
Now
the
cry
of
the
children
of
Israel
is
come
unto
and
I
have
also
seen
the
oppression
wherewith
the
Egyptians
oppress
Exo3:10
Come
now
and
I
will
send
thee
unto
that
thou
mayest
bring
forth
my
people
the
children
of
Israel
out
of
Exo3:11
And
Moses
said
unto
Who
am
that
I
should
go
unto
and
that
I
should
bring
forth
the
children
of
Israel
out
of
Exo3:12
And
he
Certainly
I
will
be
with

this
shall
be
a
token
unto
that
I
have
sent
When
thou
hast
brou

people
out

serve
God
upon
this

And
Moses
said
unto
when
I
come
unto
the
children
of

shall
say
unto
The
God
of
your
fathers
hath
sent
me
unto

they
shall
say
to
What

his
what

I
say
unto

And
God
said
unto
I

he
Thus

thou
say
unto
the
children
of

sent
me

God
said
moreover

unto
all

that
which

done
to
you
in

And
I
have

will
bring
you
up
out
of

affliction
of

unto

us
we
beseech
three

that
we
may
sacrifice

And
I
am
sure
that
the
king
of
Egypt
will
not
let
you

a
mighty
Exo3:20
And
I
will
stretch
out
my

smite
Egypt
with
all
my
wonders
which
I
will
do
in
the
midst

after
that

I
will
give

Moses
answered

The

And
Moses
went

returned
to
Jethro
his
father
in

said
unto
Let
me
I
pray
and
return
unto
my
bret

Jethro
said
to
Go

And
the
LORD
said
unto
Moses

return
into

all
the
men

And
Moses
took

he
returned

the
land
of

Moses
took

God
in
his
Exo4:21
And
the
LORD
said
unto
When
thou
goest

And
it
came
to
pass
by
the
way
in
the
that
the
LORD
met
and
sought
to
kill
Exo4:25
Then
Zipporah
took
a
sharp

cut
off
the
foreskin
of
her
and
cast
it
at
his
and
Surely
a
bloody

So
he
let

A

And
the
LORD
said
to
Go
into

wilderness
to

he
and
met
him
in
the
mount
of
and
kissed
Exo4:28
And
Moses
told
Aaron
all
the
words
of
the
LORD
who
had
sent
and
all
the
signs
which
he
had
commanded
Exo4:29
And
Moses
and
Aaron
went
and
gathered
together
all
the
elders
of
the
children
of
Exo4:30
And
Aaron
spake
all
the
words
which
the
LORD
had
spoken
unto
and
did
the
signs
in
the
sight
of
the
Exo4:31
And
the
people
and
when
they
heard
that
the
LORD
had
visited
the
children

had
looked
upon

they
bowed
their
heads

And
afterward
Moses

Aaron
went
and
told
Thus

the
LORD

Exo5:4
And
the
king
of
Egypt
said
unto
Wherefore

Moses
and
let
the
people
from
their
get
you
unto
your

Exo5:5
And
Pharaoh
the
people
of
the
land
now
are
and
ye
make
them
rest
from
their
Exo5:6
And
Pharaoh
commanded
the
same
day
the
taskmasters
of

their
Exo5:7
Ye
shall
no
more

the
people
straw
to

let
them
go

for
Exo5:8
And
the
tale
of
the
which
they
did
make
ye
shall
lay
upon

Let

Let
there
more
work
be
laid
upon
the
that
they
may
labour
and
let
them
not

Exo5:10
And
the
taskmasters
of
the
people
went

they
spake
to
the
Thus

So
the
people
were
scattered
abroad
throughout
all
the
land
of
Egypt
to
gather
stubble
instead
of

And
the
taskmasters
hasted
Fulfil

And
the

Where

Then
the
officers
of
the
children
of
Israel
came
and
cried
unto
Wherefore
dealest

thus
with
thy
serva

Exo5:16
There

And
the
officers
of
the
children
of

did
see
that
they
were
in
evil
after
it
was
Ye

Exo5:20
And
they
met
Moses

as
they
came
forth
from
Exo5:21
And
they
said
unto
The
LORD

eyes
of
P

And
Moses
returned
unto
the

wherefore

he
cried
unto

the
LORD
shewed
him

when
he
had
cast

the
the
waters
were
made

there
he
made
for
them
a
statute
and
an
and
there
he
proved
Exo15:26
And
If
thou
wilt
diligently
hearken
to
the
voice
of
the
LORD
thy
and
wilt
do
that
which

Exo15:27
And
they
came
to
Elim,
where
were
twelve
wells
of
and
threescore
and
ten
palm
and
they
encamped
there
by
the
Exo16:1
And
they
took
their
journey
from
Elim,
and
all
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
Israel
came
unto
the
wilderness
of
which
is
between
Elim
and
on
the
fifteenth
day
of
the
second
month
after
their
departing
out
of
the
land
of
Exo16:2
And
the
whole
congregation
of
the
children
of
Israel
murmured
against
Moses
and
Aaron
in
the
Exo16:3
And
the
children
of
Israel
said
unto
Would
to
God
we
had
died
by
the
hand
of
the
LORD
in
the
land
of
when
we
s
at
by
the
flesh
and
when
we
did
eat
bread
to
the
for
ye
have
brought
us
forth
into
this
to
kill
this
whole
assembly
with
Exo16:4
Then
said
the
LORD
unto
I
will
rain
bread
from
heaven
for
and
the
people
shall
go
out
and
gather
a
cert
ain
rate
every
that
I
may
prove
whether
they
will
walk
in
my
or
Exo16:5
And
it
shall
come
to
that
on
the
sixth
day
they
shall
prepare
that
which
they
bring
and
it
shall
be
twice
as
much
as
they
gather
Exo16:6
And
Moses
and
Aaron
said
unto
all
the
children
of
At
then
ye
shall
know
that
the
LORD
hath
brought
you
out
fr
om
the
land
of
Exo16:7
And
in
the
then
ye
shall
see
the
glory
of
the
for
that
he
heareth
your
murmurings
against
the
and
what
are
that
ye
murmur
against
Exo16:8
And
Moses
This
shall
when
the
LORD
shall
give
you
in
the
evening
flesh
to
and
in
the
morning
bread
to
the

for
that
the
LORD
heareth
your
murmurings
which
ye
murmur
against
and
what
are
your
murmurings
are
not
against
but
against
the
Exo16:9
And
Moses
spake
unto
Say
unto
all
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
Come
near
before
the
for
he
hath
heard
your
murmurings.
Exo16:10
And
it
came
to
as
Aaron
spake
unto
the
whole
congregation
of
the
children
of
that
they
looked
toward
the
wil
derness,
the
glory
of
the
LORD
appeared
in
the
Exo16:11
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Exo16:12
I
have
heard
the
murmurings
of
the
children
of
speak
unto
At
even
ye
shall
eat
and
in
the
mor
ning
ye
shall
be
filled
with
and
ye
shall
know
that
I
am
the
LORD
your
Exo16:13
And
it
came
to
that
at
even
the
quails
came
and
covered
the
and
in
the
morning
the
dew
lay
round
about
the
Exo16:14
And
when
the
dew
that
lay
was
gone
upon
the
face
of
the
wilderness
there
lay
a
small
round
as
small
as
the
hoar
frost
on
the
Exo16:15
And
when
the
children
of
Israel
saw
they
said
one
to
It
is
for
they
wist
not
what
it
And
Moses
sa
id
unto
This
is
the
bread
which
the
LORD
hath
given
you
to
Exo16:16
This
is
the
thing
which
the
LORD
hath
Gather
of
it
every
man
according
to
his
an
omer
for
every
ac
cording
to
the
number
of
your
take
ye
every
man
for
them
which
are
in
his
Exo16:17
And
the
children
of
Israel
did
and
some
some
Exo16:18
And
when
they
did
mete
it
with
an
he
that
gathered
much
had
nothing
and
he
that
gathered
little
had
no
t
hey
gathered
every
man
according
to
his
Exo16:19
And
Moses
Let
no
man
leave
of
it
till
the
Exo16:20
Notwithstanding
they
hearkened
not
unto
but
some
of
them
left
of
it
until
the
and
it
bred
and
stank
:
and
Moses
was
wroth
with
Exo16:21
And
they
gathered
it
every
every
man
according
to
his
and
when
the
sun
waxed
it
Exo16:22
And
it
came
to
that
on
the
sixth
day
they
gathered
twice
as
much
two
omers
for
one
and
all
the
rulers
of
the
congregation
came
and
told
Exo16:23
And
he
said
unto
This
is
that
which
the
LORD
hath
To
morrow
is
the
rest
of
the
holy
sabbath
unto
the
bak
e
that
which
ye
will
bake
to
and
seethe
that
ye
will
and
that
which
remaineth
over
lay
up
for
you
to
be
kept
until
the
Exo16:24
And
they
laid
it
up
till
the
as
Moses
and
it
did
not
neither
was
there
any
worm
Exo16:25
And
Moses
Eat
that
to
for
to
day
is
a
sabbath
unto
the
to
day
ye
shall
not
find
it
in
the
Exo16:26
Six
days
ye
shall
gather
but
on
the
seventh
which
is
the
in
it
there
shall
be
Exo16:27
And
it
came
to
that
there
went
out
some
of
the
people
on
the
seventh
day
for
to
and
they
found
Exo16:28
And
the
LORD
said
unto
How
long
refuse
ye
to
keep
my
commandments
and
my
Exo16:29
for
that
the
LORD
hath
given
you
the
therefore
he
giveth
you
on
the
sixth
day
the
bread
of
two
abide
y
e
every
man
in
his
let
no
man
go
out
of
his
place
on
the
seventh
Exo16:30
So
the
people
rested
on
the
seventh
Exo16:31
And
the
house
of
Israel
called
the
name
thereof
and
it
was
like
coriander
and
the
taste
of
it
was
like
wafers
made
with
Exo16:32
And
Moses
This
is
the
thing
which
the
LORD
commandeth,
Fill
an
omer
of
it
to
be
kept
for
your
that
they
may
see
the
bread
wherewith
I
have
fed
you
in
the
when
I
brought
you
forth
from
the
land
of
Exo16:33
And
Moses
said
unto
Take
a
and
put
an
omer
full
of
manna
and
lay
it
up
before
the
to
be
kept
fo
r
your
Exo16:34
As
the
LORD
commanded
so
Aaron
laid
it
up
before
the
to
be
Exo16:35
And
the
children
of
Israel
did
eat
manna
forty
until
they
came
to
a
land
they
did
eat
until
they
came
unto
the
borders
of
the
land
of
Exo16:36
Now
an
omer
is
the
tenth
part
of
an
Exo17:1
And
all
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
Israel
journeyed
from
the
wilderness
of
after
their
according
to
the
commandment
of
the
and
pitched
in
Rephidim:
and
there
was
no
water
for
the
people
to
Exo17:2
Wherefore
the
people
did
chide
with
and
Give
us
water
that
we
may
And
Moses
said
unto
Why
chide
y
e
with
wherefore
do
ye
tempt
the
Exo17:3
And
the
people
thirsted
there
for
and
the
people
murmured
against
and
Wherefore
is
this
that
thou
hast
brought
us
up
out
of
to
kill
us
and
our
children
and
our
cattle
with
Exo17:4
And
Moses
cried
unto
the
What
shall
I
do
unto
this
they
be
almost
ready
to
stone
Exo17:5
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Go
on
before
the
and
take
with
thee
of
the
elders
of
and
thy
wherewith
t
hou
smotest
the
take
in
thine
and
Exo17:6
I
will
stand
before
thee
there
upon
the
rock
in
and
thou
shalt
smite
the
and
there
shall
come
water
ou
t
of
that
the
people
may
And
Moses
did
so
in
the
sight
of
the
elders
of
Exo17:7
And
he
called
the
name
of
the
place
Massah,
and
Meribah,
because
of
the
chiding
of
the
children
of
and
because
they
tempted
the
Is
the
LORD
among
or
Exo17:8
Then
came
Amalek,
and
fought
with
Israel
in
Rephidim.
Exo17:9
And
Moses
said
unto
Choose
us
out
and
go
fight
with
Amalek:
to
morrow
I
will
stand
on
the
top
of
the
hill
with
the
rod
of
God
in
mine
Exo17:10
So
Joshua
did
as
Moses
had
said
to
and
fought
with
Amalek:
and
and
Hur
went
up
to
the
top
of
the
Exo17:11
And
it
came
to
when
Moses
held
up
his
that
Israel
and
when
he
let
down
his
Amalek
Exo17:12
But
hands
were
and
they
took
a
and
put
it
under
and
he
sat
and
Aaron
and
Hur
stayed
up
his
the
one
on
the
one
and
the
other
on
the
other
and
his
hands
were
steady
until
the
going
down
of
the
Exo17:13
And
Joshua
discomfited
Amalek
and
his
people
with
the
edge
of
the
Exo17:14
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Write
this
for
a
memorial
in
a
and
rehearse
it
in
the
ears
of
for
I
will
utter
ly
put
out
the
remembrance
of
Amalek
from
under
Exo17:15
And
Moses
built
an
and
called
the
name
of
it
Jehovahnissi:
Exo17:16
For
he
Because
the
LORD
hath
sworn
that
the
LORD
will
have
war
with
Amalek
from
generation
to
Exo18:1
When
the
priest
of
father
in
heard
of
all
that
God
had
done
for
and
for
Israel
his
peopl
e,
and
that
the
LORD
had
brought
Israel
out
of
Exo18:2
Then
father
in
took
Zipporah,
after
he
had
sent
her
Exo18:3
And
her
two
of
which
the
name
of
the
one
was
Gershom;
for
he
I
have
been
an
alien
in
a
strange
Exo18:4
And
the
name
of
the
other
was
Eliezer;
for
the
God
of
my
said
was
mine
and
delivered
me
from
the
sword
of
Exo18:5
And
father
in
came
with
his
sons
and
his
wife
unto
Moses
into
the
where
he
encamped
at
the
mount
of
Exo18:6
And
he
said
unto
I
thy
father
in
law
Jethro
am
come
unto
and
thy
and
her
two
sons
with
Exo18:7
And
Moses
went
out
to
meet
his
father
in
and
did
and
kissed
and
they
asked
each
other
of
their
welfare
;
and
they
came
into
the
Exo18:8
And
Moses
told
his
father
in
law
all
that
the
LORD
had
done
unto
Pharaoh
and
to
the
Egyptians
for
Israel's
and
all
th
e
travail
that
had
come
upon
them
by
the
and
how
the
LORD
delivered
Exo18:9
And
Jethro
rejoiced
for
all
the
goodness
which
the
LORD
had
done
to
whom
he
had
delivered
out
of
the
hand
of
the
Eg
yptians.
Exo18:10
And
Jethro
Blessed
be
the
who
hath
delivered
you
out
of
the
hand
of
the
and
out
of
the
hand
of
Phar
aoh,
who
hath
delivered
the
people
from
under
the
hand
of
the
Exo18:11
Now
I
know
that
the
LORD
is
greater
than
all
for
in
the
thing
wherein
they
dealt
proudly
he
was
above
Exo18:12
And
father
in
took
a
burnt
offering
and
sacrifices
for
and
Aaron
and
all
the
elders
of
Isra
to
eat
bread
with
father
in
law
before
Exo18:13
And
it
came
to
pass
on
the
that
Moses
sat
to
judge
the
and
the
people
stood
by
Moses
from
the
morning
unto
the
Exo18:14
And
when
father
in
law
saw
all
that
he
did
to
the
he
What
is
this
thing
that
thou
doest
to
the
people
?
why
sittest
thou
thyself
and
all
the
people
stand
by
thee
from
morning
unto
Exo18:15
And
Moses
said
unto
his
father
in
Because
the
people
come
unto
me
to
enquire
of
Exo18:16
When
they
have
a
they
come
unto
and
I
judge
between
one
and
and
I
do
make
them
know
the
statutes
of
G
od,
and
his
Exo18:17
And
father
in
law
said
unto
The
thing
that
thou
doest
is
not
Exo18:18
Thou
wilt
surely
wear
both
and
this
people
that
is
with
for
this
thing
is
too
heavy
for
thou
art
n
ot
able
to
perform
it
thyself
Exo18:19
Hearken
now
unto
my
I
will
give
thee
and
God
shall
be
with
Be
thou
for
the
people
to
God-ward,
that
thou
mayest
bring
the
causes
unto
Exo18:20
And
thou
shalt
teach
them
ordinances
and
and
shalt
shew
them
the
way
wherein
they
must
and
the
work
that
they
must
Exo18:21
Moreover
thou
shalt
provide
out
of
all
the
people
able
such
as
fear
men
of
hating
and
place
such
over
to
be
rulers
of
and
rulers
of
rulers
of
and
rulers
of
Exo18:22
And
let
them
judge
the
people
at
all
and
it
shall
that
every
great
matter
they
shall
bring
unto
but
eve
ry
small
matter
they
shall
so
shall
it
be
easier
for
and
they
shall
bear
the
burden
with
Exo18:23
If
thou
shalt
do
this
and
God
command
thee
then
thou
shalt
be
able
to
and
all
this
people
shall
also
go
to
their
place
in
Exo18:24
So
Moses
hearkened
to
the
voice
of
his
father
in
and
did
all
that
he
had
Exo18:25
And
Moses
chose
able
men
out
of
all
and
made
them
heads
over
the
rulers
of
rulers
of
rulers
of
and
rulers
of
Exo18:26
And
they
judged
the
people
at
all
the
hard
causes
they
brought
unto
but
every
small
matter
they
judged
the
mselves.
Exo18:27
And
Moses
let
his
father
in
law
and
he
went
his
way
into
his
own
Exo19:1
In
the
third
when
the
children
of
Israel
were
gone
forth
out
of
the
land
of
the
same
day
came
they
into
the
w
ilderness
of
Exo19:2
For
they
were
departed
from
Rephidim,
and
were
come
to
the
desert
of
and
had
pitched
in
the
and
there
Is
rael
camped
before
the
Exo19:3
And
Moses
went
up
unto
and
the
LORD
called
unto
him
out
of
the
Thus
shalt
thou
say
to
the
house
of
J

tell
the
children

Ye
have
seen
what
I
did
unto

how
I
bare
you
on

brought
you
unto

Now
if
ye
will
obey

voice
and
keep

a
peculiar
treasure

And
ye

me

an

These
are
the
words
which
thou
shalt
speak
unto
the
child

of
Exo19:7
And
Moses
came
and
called
for
the
elders
of
the
and
laid
before
their
faces
all
these
words
which
the
LORD
commande
d
Exo19:8
And
all
the
people
answered
and
All
that
the
LORD
hath
spoken
we
will
And
Moses
returned
the
words
of
t
he
people
unto
the
Exo19:9
And
the
LORD
said
unto
I
come
unto
thee
in
a
thick
that
the
people
may
hear
when
I
speak
with
and
b

And
Moses
told
the
words
of
the
people
unto
the
Exo19:10
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Go
unto
the
and
sanctify
them
to
day

to

let
them
wash

And
be
ready
against
the
third
for
the
third
day
the
LORD
will
come
down
in
the
sight
of
all
the
people
upon
mount

Exo19:12
And
thou
shalt
set
bounds
unto
the

Take

And
the
people
stood
afar
and
Moses
drew
near
unto
the
thick
darkness
where
God
Exo20:22
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Thus
thou
shalt
say
unto
the
children
of
Ye

that
I
have
talked
with
you
fr

Exo20:23
Ye
shall
not
make
with

An

thou
shalt
make
unto
and

sacrifice
thereon
thy
burnt

thy
peace
thy

and
thine
in
all
places
where
I
record
my

And
if
thou
wilt
make
me
an

shalt
not
build
it
of

Neither
shalt
thou
go
up
by

unto
mine
that
thy
nakedness
be
not
discovered
Exo21:1
Now
these
are
the
judgments
which
thou
shalt
set
before
Exo21:2
If
thou
buy
an
Hebrew
six
years
he
shall
and
in
the
seventh
he
shall
go
out
free
for

If

And
if
the
servant
shall
plainly
I
love
my
my

my
I
will
not
go

Exo21:6
Then
his
master
shall
bring
him
unto
the

If

I
will
appoint
thee

whither
he
shall

presumptuously
upon

And
he
that
curseth

And
if
men
strive
and

smite
another
with
a

abroad
upon

for
the
loss
of

I
have
spoken
of

I
give

they
shall
inherit
it
for

repented
of

It

not
the
voice

came
to

came
nigh
unto
the

waxed
and
he
cast
the
tables
out
of
his

brake
them
beneath
the
Exo32:20
And
he
took
the
calf
which
they
had

burnt
it
in
the
and
ground
it
to

strawed
it
upon
the

said
unto
What
did
this

unto
that
thou
hast
brought
so
great
a
sin
upon
Exo32:22
And
Aaron
Let
not

anger
of
my
lord
wax

knowest
the
that
they
are
set
on
Exo32:23
For
they
said
unto
Make

the
man
that
brought
us
up
out
of
th

of
Exo32:24
And
I
said
unto
Whosoever

So
they
gave
it

I
cast
it
into

came
out

Exo32:25
And
when
Moses
saw
that
the
people
were
(for
Aaron
had
made
them
naked
unto
their
shame
among
their
enemies:)
Exo32:26
Then
Moses
stood
in
the
gate
of
the
and
Who
is
on
the
LORD's
let
him
come
unto
And
all
the
sons
of
L
evi
gathered
themselves
together
unto
Exo32:27
And
he
said
unto
Thus
saith
the
LORD
God
of
Put
every

his
sword
by
his
and
go
in

out
from

Exo32:28
And
the
children
of

did
according
to
the
word
of

there
fell

Exo32:29
For

had
Consecrate

that
he
ma

bestow
upon
you
a
blessing
this
Exo32:30
And
it
came
to
pass
on
the
that
Moses
said
unto
the
Ye
have
sinned
a
great
and
now
I
will
go
up
unto
the
peradventure
I
shall
make
an
atonement
for
your
Exo32:31
And
Moses
returned
unto
the
and
this
people
have
sinned
a
great
and
have
made
them
gods
of
Exo32:32
Yet
if
thou
wilt
forgive
their
sin--;
and
if
blot
I
pray
out
of
thy
book
which
thou
hast
Exo32:33
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Whosoever
hath
sinned
against
him
will
I
blot
out
of
my
Exo32:34
Therefore
now
lead
the
people
unto
the
place
of
which
I
have
spoken
unto
mine
Angel
shall
go
before
thee
:
nevertheless
in
the
day
when
I
visit
I
will
visit
their
sin
upon
Exo32:35
And
the
LORD
plagued
the
because
they
made
the
which
Aaron
Exo33:1
And
the
LORD
said
unto
and
go
up
thou
and
the
people
which
thou
hast
brought
up
out
of
the
land
of
Eg

unto
the
land
which
I
sware
unto
to
and
to
Unto
thy
seed
will
I
give
Exo33:2
And
I
will
send
an
angel
before
and
I
will
drive
out

Exo33:3
Unto
a
land
flowing
with
milk
and
for
I
will
not
go
up
in
the
midst
of
for
thou
art
a
stiffnecked
lest
I
consume
thee
in
the
Exo33:4
And
when
the
people
heard
these
evil
they
and
no
man
did
put
on
him
his
Exo33:5
For
the
LORD
had
said
unto
Say

will
come
up
into

therefore
now
put
off
thy
ornaments
from

I
may
know
what
to

And
the
children
of
Israel
stripped
themselves
of
their
ornaments
by
the
mount
Exo33:7
And
Moses
took
the

pitched
it
without

called
it

And
it

people
rose

stood
every

at
his
tent
and
looked
after
until
he
was
gone

And
it
came
to
as
Moses
entered
into

and
stood
at

door
of

And
all

rose
up

Exo33:11
And

he
turned

And
Moses
said
unto
the

sayest
unto
Bring
up
this
and
thou
hast
not
let
me
know
whom
thou
wilt
send

Yet
thou
hast
I
know
thee
by

Now
I
pray

And
he
said
unto

For
wherein
shall
it
be
known
here
that

and
thy
people
have
found

not
in

will
be
gracious
to

I
will
be

will
shew
mercy
on

And

Thou

And
the
LORD
there
is

And
the

said
unto

From

Wherefore

And
Israel
sent

Sihon

Sihon

went
out
aga

he
came
to
Jahaz,
and
fought
against

And
Israel
smote
him
with
the
edge
of

possessed
his
land
from
Arnon
unto
Jabbok,
even
unto
the
children

And
Israel
took
all
these

Israel
dwelt
in
all
the
cities
of
the
Amorites,
in
Heshbon,
and
in
all
the
villages
Num21:26
For
Heshbon
was
the
city
of
Sihon
the
king
of
the
Amorites,
who
had
fought
against
the
former
king
of

taken
all

Num21:27
Wherefore
they
that
speak
in

Come

Heshbon,
let

city
of
Sihon
be
built

Num21:28
For
there
is
a
fire
gone
out
of
Heshbon,
a
flame
from

city
of
Sihon:
it
hath
consumed
Ar

the
lords
of
the
high
places
of
Arnon.
Num21:29
Woe
to

O
people
of
Chemosh:
he
hath
given
his
sons
that

king
of

We

Dibon,
and
we

waste
even
unto

Num21:31
Thus
Israel
dwelt
in
the
land
of
the
Amorites.
Num21:32
And
Moses
sent
to
spy
out
Jaazer,

they

And
they

Build

And
it

Moses
spake
unto
the

of
according

all
that
the
LORD
had
given
him
in
commandment
unto
Deu1:4
After
he
had
slain
Sihon

Amorites,
which
dwelt
in
Heshbon,

dwelt

Deu1:5
On

The

unto

in
Ye

in
this
Deu1:7
Turn

unto
all
the
places
nigh
in

and
in

and
in
the
and
by
the
sea
to
the
land
of
the
Canaanites,
and
unto
unto
the
gre
at
the
river
Deu1:8
I
have
set
the
land
before
go
in
and
possess
the
land
which
the
LORD
sware
unto
your
a

to
give
unto
them
and
to
their
seed
after
Deu1:9
And
I
spake
unto
you
at
that
I
am
not
able
to
bear
you
myself
Deu1:10
The
LORD
your
God
hath
multiplied
ye
are
this
day
as
the
stars
of
heaven
for
Deu1:11
(The
LORD
God
of
your
fathers
make
you
a
thousand
times
so
many
more
as
ye
and
bless
as
he
hath
promised
you!)
Deu1:12
How
can
I
myself
alone
bear
your
cumbrance,
and
your
and
your
Deu1:13
Take
you
wise
and
and
known
among
your
and
I
will
make
them
rulers
over
Deu1:14
And
ye
answered
and
The
thing
which
thou
hast
spoken
is
good
for
us
to
Deu1:15
So
I
took
the
chief
of
your
wise
and
and
made
them
heads
over
captains
over
and
captain
s
over
and
captains
over
and
captains
over
and
officers
among
your
Deu1:16
And
I
charged
your
judges
at
that
Hear
the
causes
between
your

judge
righteously
between
every
man
and
his
and
the
stranger
that
is
with
Deu1:17
Ye
shall
not
respect
persons
in
but
ye
shall
hear
the
small
as
well
as
the
ye
shall
not
be
afraid
of
the
f

of
for
the
judgment
is
and
the
cause
that
is
too
hard
for
bring
it
unto
and
I
will
hear
Deu1:18
And
I
commanded
you
at
that
time
all
the
things
which
ye
should
Deu1:19
And
when
we
departed
from
we
went
through
all
that
great
and
terrible
which
ye
saw
by
the
way
of
the
mou

of
the
Amorites,
as
the
LORD
our
God
commanded
and
we
came
to
Kadeshbarnea.
Deu1:20
And
I
said
unto
Ye
are
come
unto
the
mountain

the
LORD
our
God
doth

the

thy
God
hath

up

the
LORD
God
of
thy
fathers
hath
said
unto
fear

And
ye
came
near
unto
me
every
one
of

We
will
send
men
before

they
shall
search
us
out

bring
us
word
again
by
what
way
we
must

into
what
cities
we
shall

And
the
saying
pleased
me
and
I
took
twelve
men
of
one
of
a
Deu1:24
And
they
turned
and
went
up
into
the
and
came
unto
the
valley
of
Eshcol,
and
searched
it
Deu1:25
And
they
took
of
the
fruit
of
the
land
in
their
and
brought
it
down
unto
and
brought
us
word
and
It
is
a
good
land
which
the
LORD
our
God
doth
give
Deu1:26
Notwithstanding
ye
would
not
go
but
rebelled
against
the
commandment
of
the
LORD
your
Deu1:27
And
ye
murmured
in
your
and
Because
the
LORD
hated
he
hath
brought
us
forth
out
of
the
land
of
to
d
eliver
us
into
the
hand
of
the
Amorites,
to
destroy
Deu1:28
Whither
shall
we
go
our
brethren
have
discouraged
our
The
people
is
greater
and
taller
than
the
citi
es
are
great
and
walled
up
to

moreover
we
have
seen
the
sons
of
the
Anakims
Deu1:29
Then
I
said
unto
Dread
neither
be
afraid
of
Deu1:30
The
LORD
your
God
which
goeth
before
he
shall
fight
for
according
to
all
that
he
did
for
you
in
Egypt
before
your
Deu1:31
And
in
the
where
thou
hast
seen
how
that
the
LORD
thy
God
bare
as
a
man
doth
bear
his
in
all
the
way
that
ye
until
ye
came
into
this
Deu1:32
Yet
in
this
thing
ye
did
not
believe
the
LORD
your
Deu1:33
Who
went
in
the
way
before
to
search
you
out
a
place
to
pitch
your
tents
in
fire
by
to
shew
you
by
what
way
ye
should
and
in
a
cloud
by
Deu1:34
And
the
LORD
heard
the
voice
of
your
and
was
and
sware,
Deu1:35
Surely
there
shall
not
one
of
these
men
of
this
evil
generation
see
that
good
which
I
sware
to
give
unto
your
fathers
,
Deu1:36
Save
Caleb
the
son
of
Jephunneh;
he
shall
see
and
to
him
will
I
give
the
land
that
he
hath
trodden
and
to
his
chi
ldren,
because
he
hath
wholly
followed
the
Deu1:37
Also
the
LORD
was
angry
with
me
for
your
Thou
also
shalt
not
go
in
Deu1:38
But
Joshua
the
son
of
which
standeth
before
he
shall
go
in
encourage
for
he
shall
cause
Israel
to
inherit

Moreover
your
little

ye
said
should
be

in
that
day
had
no
knowledge

they
shall
go

unto
them

I
give

they
shall
possess

But
as
for
turn
and
take
your
journey
into
the
wilderness
by
the
way
of
the
Red
Deu1:41
Then
ye
answered
and
said
unto
We
have
sinned
against
the
we
will
go
up
and
according
to
all
that
the
LORD
our
God
commanded
And
when
ye
had
girded
on
every
man
his
weapons
of
ye
were
ready
to
go
up
into
the
Deu1:42
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Say
unto
Go
not
neither
for
I
am
not
among
lest
ye
be
smitten
before
your
Deu1:43
So
I
spake
unto
and
ye
would
not
but
rebelled
against
the
commandment
of
the
and
went
presumptuously
up
in
to
the
Deu1:44
And
the
Amorites,
which
dwelt
in
that
came
out
against
and
chased
as
bees
and
destroyed
you
in
Seir
,
even
unto
Hormah.
Deu1:45
And
ye
returned
and
wept
before
the
but
the
LORD
would
not
hearken
to
your
nor
give
ear
unto
Deu1:46
So
ye
abode
in
Kadesh
many
according
unto
the
days
that
ye
abode
Deu2:1
Then
we
and
took
our
journey
into
the
wilderness
by
the
way
of
the
Red
as
the
LORD
spake
unto
and
we
compas
sed

many
Deu2:2
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
Deu2:3
Ye
have
compassed
this
mountain

And
command
thou

Ye
are
to
pass
through
the
coast
of
your
brethren
the
children
of
which
dwell
in
Seir;
and
they
shall
be
afraid

ye
good
heed
unto
yourselves
Deu2:5
Meddle
not
with
for
I
will
not
give
you
of

so
much
as
a
foot
because
I
have
given

unto
Esau
for
a
Deu2:6
Ye
shall
buy
meat
of
them
for
that
ye
may

ye
shall
also
buy
water
of

for
that
ye

For
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
blessed
thee
in
all
the
works
of
thy

knoweth
thy
walking
through
this
great
t
hese
forty
years
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
been
with

lacked
Deu2:8
And
when
we
passed
by
from
our
brethren
the
children
of
which
dwelt
in
Seir,
through
the
way
of
the
plain
from
Elath,
and
from
Eziongaber,
we
turned
and
passed
by
the
way
of
the
wilderness
of
Deu2:9
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Distress
not
the
Moabites,
neither
contend
with
them
in
for
I
will
not
give
thee
of
their
land
for
a
because
I
have
given
Ar
unto
the
children
of
Lot
for
a
Deu2:10
The
Emims
dwelt
therein
in
times
a
people
and
and
as
the
Anakims;
Deu2:11
Which
also
were
accounted
as
the
Anakims;
but
the
Moabites
call
them
Emims.
Deu2:12
The
Horims
also
dwelt
in
Seir
but
the
children
of
Esau
succeeded
when
they
had
destroyed
them
from
before
and
dwelt
in
their
as
Israel
did
unto
the
land
of
his
which
the
LORD
gave
unto
Deu2:13
Now
rise
said
and
get
you
over
the
brook
Zered.
And
we
went
over
the
brook
Zered.
Deu2:14
And
the
space
in
which
we
came
from
Kadeshbarnea,
until
we
were
come
over
the
brook
Zered,
was
thirty
and
eight
unti
l
all
the
generation
of
the
men
of
war
were
wasted
out
from
among
the
as
the
LORD
sware
unto
Deu2:15
For
indeed
the
hand
of
the
LORD
was
against
to
destroy
them
from
among
the
until
they
were
Deu2:16
So
it
came
to
when
all
the
men
of
war
were
consumed
and
dead
from
among
the
Deu2:17
That
the
LORD
spake
unto
Deu2:18
Thou
art
to
pass
over
through
the
coast
of
this
Deu2:19
And
when
thou
comest
nigh
over
against
the
children
of
distress
them
nor
meddle
with
for
I
will
not
give
thee
of
the
land
of
the
children
of
Ammon
any
because
I
have
given
it
unto
the
children
of
Lot
for
a
Deu2:20
(That
also
was
accounted
a
land
of
giants
dwelt
therein
in
old
and
the
Ammonites
call
them
Zamzummims;
Deu2:21
A
people
and
and
as
the
Anakims;
but
the
LORD
destroyed
them
before
and
they
succeeded
and
d
welt
in
their
Deu2:22
As
he
did
to
the
children
of
which
dwelt
in
Seir,
when
he
destroyed
the
Horims
from
before
and
they
succeeded
t
and
dwelt
in
their
stead
even
unto
this
Deu2:23
And
the
Avims
which
dwelt
in
Hazerim,
even
unto
Azzah,
the
Caphtorims,
which
came
forth
out
of
Caphtor,
destroyed
and
dwelt
in
their
stead.)
Deu2:24
Rise
ye
take
your
and
pass
over
the
river
Arnon:
I
have
given
into
thine
hand
Sihon
the
Amorite,
king
of
Heshbon,
and
his
begin
to
possess
and
contend
with
him
in
Deu2:25
This
day
will
I
begin
to
put
the
dread
of
thee
and
the
fear
of
thee
upon
the
nations
that
are
under
the
whole
who
s
hall
hear
report
of
and
shall
and
be
in
anguish
because
of
Deu2:26
And
I
sent
messengers
out
of
the
wilderness
of
Kedemoth
unto
Sihon
king
of
Heshbon
with
words
of
Deu2:27
Let
me
pass
through
thy
I
will
go
along
by
the
high
I
will
neither
turn
unto
the
right
hand
nor
to
the
Deu2:28
Thou
shalt
sell
me
meat
for
that
I
may
and
give
me
water
for
that
I
may
only
I
will
pass
through
on
my
Deu2:29
(As
the
children
of
Esau
which
dwell
in
Seir,
and
the
Moabites
which
dwell
in
did
unto
me;)
until
I
shall
pass
over
Jor
dan
into
the
land
which
the
LORD
our
God
giveth
Deu2:30
But
Sihon
king
of
Heshbon
would
not
let
us
pass
by
for
the
LORD
thy
God
hardened
his
and
made
his
heart
obstin
that
he
might
deliver
him
into
thy
as
appeareth
this
Deu2:31
And
the
LORD
said
unto
I
have
begun
to
give
Sihon
and
his
land
before
begin
to
that
thou
mayest
inherit
his
Deu2:32
Then
Sihon
came
out
against
he
and
all
his
to
fight
at
Jahaz.
Deu2:33
And
the
LORD
our
God
delivered
him
before
and
we
smote
and
his
and
all
his
Deu2:34
And
we
took
all
his
cities
at
that
and
utterly
destroyed
the
and
the
and
the
little
of
every
we
left
none
to
Deu2:35
Only
the
cattle
we
took
for
a
prey
unto
and
the
spoil
of
the
cities
which
we
Deu2:36
From
Aroer,
which
is
by
the
brink
of
the
river
of
Arnon,
and
from
the
city
that
is
by
the
even
unto
there
wa

not
one
city
too
strong
for
the
LORD
our
God
delivered
all
unto
Deu2:37
Only
unto
the
land
of
the
children
of
Ammon
thou
camest
nor
unto
any
place
of
the
river
Jabbok,
nor
unto
the
cities
in
the
nor
unto
whatsoever
the
LORD
our
God
forbad
Deu3:1
Then
we
and
went
up
the
way
to
and
Og
the
king
of
Bashan
came
out
against
he
and
all
his
to
batt
le
at
Edrei.
Deu3:2
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Fear
him
for
I
will
deliver
and
all
his
and
his
into
thy
and
thou
s
halt
do
unto
him
as
thou
didst
unto
Sihon
king
of
the
Amorites,
which
dwelt
at
Heshbon.
Deu3:3
So
the
LORD
our
God
delivered
into
our
hands
Og
the
king
of
and
all
his
and
we
smote
him
until
none
wa

left
to
him
Deu3:4
And
we
took
all
his
cities
at
that
there
was
not
a
city
which
we
took
not
from
threescore
all
the
region
of
Argob,
the
kingdom
of
Og
in
Deu3:5
All
these
cities
were
fenced
with
high
and
beside
unwalled
towns
a
great
Deu3:6
And
we
utterly
destroyed
as
we
did
unto
Sihon
king
of
Heshbon,
utterly
destroying
the
and
of
eve
ry
Deu3:7
But
all
the
and
the
spoil
of
the
we
took
for
a
prey
to
Deu3:8
And
we
took
at
that
time
out
of
the
hand
of
the
two
kings
of
the
Amorites
the
land
that
was
on
this
side
from
the
ri
ver
of
Arnon
unto
mount
Deu3:9
(Which
Hermon
the
Sidonians
call
Sirion;
and
the
Amorites
call
it
Shenir;)
Deu3:10
All
the
cities
of
the
and
all
and
all
unto
Salchah
and
Edrei,
cities
of
the
kingdom
of
Og
in
Deu3:11
For
only
Og
king
of
Bashan
remained
of
the
remnant
of
his
bedstead
was
a
bedstead
of

not
in
Rab
bath
of
the
children
of
nine
cubits
was
the
length
and
four
cubits
the
breadth
of
after
the
cubit
of
a
Deu3:12
And
this
which
we
possessed
at
that
from
Aroer,
which
is
by
the
river
Arnon,
and
half
mount
and
the
cit
ies
gave
I
unto
the
Reubenites
and
to
the
Gadites.
Deu3:13
And
the
rest
of
and
all
being
the
kingdom
of
Og,
gave
I
unto
the
half
tribe
of
all
the
region
of
Argob,
with
all
which
was
called
the
land
of
Deu3:14
Jair
the
son
of
Manasseh
took
all
the
country
of
Argob
unto
the
coasts
of
Geshuri
and
Maachathi;
and
called
them
after
his
own
Bashanhavothjair,
unto
this
Deu3:15
And
I
gave
Gilead
unto
Machir.
Deu3:16
And
unto
the
Reubenites
and
unto
the
Gadites
I
gave
from
Gilead
even
unto
the
river
Arnon
half
the
and
the
border
e
ven
unto
the
river
Jabbok,
which
is
the
border
of
the
children
of
Deu3:17
The
plain
and
and
the
coast
from
Chinnereth
even
unto
the
sea
of
the
even
the
salt
under
Ashdothpisgah
Deu3:18
And
I
commanded
you
at
that
The
LORD
your
God
hath
given
you
this
land
to
possess
ye
shall
pass
over
arme
d
before
your
brethren
the
children
of
all
that
are
meet
for
the
Deu3:19
But
your
and
your
little
and
your
(for
I
know
that
ye
have
much
cattle,)
shall
abide
in
your
cities
wh
ich
I
have
given
Deu3:20
Until
the
LORD
have
given
rest
unto
your
as
well
as
unto
and
until
they
also
possess
the
land
which
the
LORD
your
God
hath
given
them
beyond
and
then
shall
ye
return
every
man
unto
his
which
I
have
given
Deu3:21
And
I
commanded
Joshua
at
that
Thine
eyes
have
seen
all
that
the
LORD
your
God
hath
done
unto
these
two
kings
:
so
shall
the
LORD
do
unto
all
the
kingdoms
whither
thou
passest.
Deu3:22
Ye
shall
not
fear
for
the
LORD
your
God
he
shall
fight
for
Deu3:23
And
I
besought
the
LORD
at
that
Deu3:24
O
Lord
thou
hast
begun
to
shew
thy
servant
thy
and
thy
mighty
for
what
God
is
there
in
heaven
or
in
e
arth,
that
can
do
according
to
thy
and
according
to
thy
Deu3:25
I
pray
let
me
go
and
see
the
good
land
that
is
beyond
that
goodly
and
Deu3:26
But
the
LORD
was
wroth
with
me
for
your
and
would
not
hear
and
the
LORD
said
unto
Let
it
suffice
speak
no
more
unto
me
of
this
Deu3:27
Get
thee
up
into
the
top
of
and
lift
up
thine
eyes
and
and
and
and
behold
it
with
thine
for
thou
shalt
not
go
over
this
Deu3:28
But
charge
and
encourage
and
strengthen
for
he
shall
go
over
before
this
and
he
shall
cause
them
to
inherit
the
land
which
thou
shalt
Deu3:29
So
we
abode
in
the
valley
over
against
Bethpeor.
Deu4:1
Now
therefore
O
unto
the
statutes
and
unto
the
which
I
teach
for
to
do
that
ye
may
li

and
go
in
and
possess
the
land
which
the
LORD
God
of
your
fathers
giveth
Deu4:2
Ye
shall
not
add
unto
the
word
which
I
command
neither
shall
ye
diminish
ought
from
that
ye
may
keep
the
commandmen
ts
of
the
LORD
your
God
which
I
command
Deu4:3
Your
eyes
have
seen
what
the
LORD
did
because
of
Baalpeor:
for
all
the
men
that
followed
Baalpeor,
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
des
troyed
them
from
among
Deu4:4
But
ye
that
did
cleave
unto
the
LORD
your
God
are
alive
every
one
of
you
this
Deu4:5
I
have
taught
you
statutes
and
even
as
the
LORD
my
God
commanded
that
ye
should
do
so
in
the
land
whi
ther
ye
go
to
possess
Deu4:6
Keep
therefore
and
do
for
this

your
wisdom
and
your
understanding
in
the
sight
of
the
which
shall
hear
all
these
and
Surely
this
great
nation
is
a
wise
and
understanding
Deu4:7
For
what
nation
is
there
so
who
hath
God
so
nigh
unto
as
the
LORD
our
God
is
in
all
things
that
we
call
upon
hi
m
Deu4:8
And
what
nation
is
there
so
that
hath
statutes
and
judgments
so
righteous
as
all
this
which
I
set
before
you
thi
s
Deu4:9
Only
take
heed
to
and
keep
thy
soul
lest
thou
forget
the
things
which
thine
eyes
have
and
lest
th
ey
depart
from
thy
heart
all
the
days
of
thy
but
teach
them
thy
and
thy
Deu4:10
Specially
the
day
that
thou
stoodest
before
the
LORD
thy
God
in
when
the
LORD
said
unto
Gather
me
the
people
tog
and
I
will
make
them
hear
my
that
they
may
learn
to
fear
me
all
the
days
that
they
shall
live
upon
the
and
tha
t
they
may
teach
their
Deu4:11
And
ye
came
near
and
stood
under
the
and
the
mountain
burned
with
fire
unto
the
midst
of
with
c
louds,
and
thick
Deu4:12
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
you
out
of
the
midst
of
the
ye
heard
the
voice
of
the
but
saw
no
only
ye
h
eard
a
Deu4:13
And
he
declared
unto
you
his
which
he
commanded
you
to
even
ten
and
he
wrote
them
upon
two
tables
of
Deu4:14
And
the
LORD
commanded
me
at
that
time
to
teach
you
statutes
and
that
ye
might
do
them
in
the
land
whither
ye
go
over
to
possess
Deu4:15
Take
ye
therefore
good
heed
unto
for
ye
saw
no
manner
of
similitude
on
the
day
that
the
LORD
spake
unto
you
in
Horeb
out
of
the
midst
of
the
Deu4:16
Lest
ye
corrupt
and
make
you
a
graven
the
similitude
of
any
the
likeness
of
male
or
Deu4:17
The
likeness
of
any
beast
that
is
on
the
the
likeness
of
any
winged
fowl
that
flieth
in
the
Deu4:18
The
likeness
of
any
thing
that
creepeth
on
the
the
likeness
of
any
fish
that
is
in
the
waters
beneath
the
Deu4:19
And
lest
thou
lift
up
thine
eyes
unto
and
when
thou
seest
the
and
the
and
the
even
all
the
host
o
f
shouldest
be
driven
to
worship
and
serve
which
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
divided
unto
all
nations
under
the
whole
Deu4:20
But
the
LORD
hath
taken
and
brought
you
forth
out
of
the
iron
even
out
of
to
be
unto
him
a
people
of
i
nheritance,
as
ye
are
this
Deu4:21
Furthermore
the
LORD
was
angry
with
me
for
your
and
sware
that
I
should
not
go
over
and
that
I
should
not
go
in
unto
that
good
which
the
LORD
thy
God
giveth
thee
for
an
Deu4:22
But
I
must
die
in
this
I
must
not
go
over
but
ye
shall
go
and
possess
that
good
Deu4:23
Take
heed
unto
lest
ye
forget
the
covenant
of
the
LORD
your
which
he
made
with
and
make
you
a
graven
or
the
likeness
of
any
which
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
forbidden
Deu4:24
For
the
LORD
thy
God
is
a
consuming
even
a
jealous
Deu4:25
When
thou
shalt
beget
and
children's
and
ye
shall
have
remained
long
in
the
and
shall
corrupt
you
rselves,
and
make
a
graven
or
the
likeness
of
any
and
shall
do
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD
thy
to
provoke
him
to
Deu4:26
I
call
heaven
and
earth
to
witness
against
you
this
that
ye
shall
soon
utterly
perish
from
off
the
land
whereunto
ye
g
o
over
Jordan
to
possess
ye
shall
not
prolong
your
days
upon
but
shall
utterly
be
Deu4:27
And
the
LORD
shall
scatter
you
among
the
and
ye
shall
be
left
few
in
number
among
the
whither
the
LORD
sh
all
lead
Deu4:28
And
there
ye
shall
serve
the
work
of
men's
wood
and
which
neither
nor
nor
nor
Deu4:29
But
if
from
thence
thou
shalt
seek
the
LORD
thy
thou
shalt
find
if
thou
seek
him
with
all
thy
heart
and
with
all
thy
Deu4:30
When
thou
art
in
and
all
these
things
are
come
upon
even
in
the
latter
if
thou
turn
to
the
LORD
th
y
and
shalt
be
obedient
unto
his
Deu4:31
(For
the
LORD
thy
God
is
a
merciful
God;)
he
will
not
forsake
neither
destroy
nor
forget
the
covenant
of
thy
fa
thers
which
he
sware
unto
Deu4:32
For
ask
now
of
the
days
that
are
which
were
before
since
the
day
that
God
created
man
upon
the
and
ask
f
rom
the
one
side
of
heaven
unto
the
whether
there
hath
been
any
such
thing
as
this
great
thing
or
hath
been
heard
like

Deu4:33
Did
ever
people
hear
the
voice
of
God
speaking
out
of
the
midst
of
the
as
thou
hast
and
Deu4:34
Or
hath
God
assayed
to
go
and
take
him
a
nation
from
the
midst
of
another
by
by
and
by
and
by
and
by
a
mighty
and
by
a
stretched
out
and
by
great
according
to
all
that
the
LORD
your
God
did
fo
r
you
in
Egypt
before
your
Deu4:35
Unto
thee
it
was
shewed,
that
thou
mightest
know
that
the
LORD
he
is
there
is
none
else
beside
Deu4:36
Out
of
heaven
he
made
thee
to
hear
his
that
he
might
instruct
and
upon
earth
he
shewed
thee
his
great
an
d
thou
heardest
his
words
out
of
the
midst
of
the
Deu4:37
And
because
he
loved
thy
therefore
he
chose
their
seed
after
and
brought
thee
out
in
his
sight
with
his
migh
ty
power
out
of
Deu4:38
To
drive
out
nations
from
before
thee
greater
and
mightier
than
thou
to
bring
thee
to
give
thee
their
land
for
an
as
it
is
this
Deu4:39
Know
therefore
this
and
consider
it
in
thine
that

LORD

is
God
in
heaven
and
upon
the
earth
beneat

there
is
none

Thou
shalt
keep
therefore
his
and
his
which
I
command
thee
this
that
it
may
go
well
with
and
with
thy
children
after
and
that
thou
mayest
prolong
thy
days
upon
the
which
the
LORD
thy
God
giveth
for

Deu4:41
Then
Moses
severed
three
cities
on
this
side
Jordan
toward
the
sunrising;
Deu4:42
That
the
slayer
might
flee
which
should
kill
his
neighbour
and
hated
him
not
in
times
and
that
fle

unto
one
of
these
cities

might

Bezer
in

in
the
plain
of
the
Reubenites;
and
Ramoth
in
of
the
Gadites;
and
Golan
i

of
the
Manassites.
Deu4:44
And
this
is
the
law
which
Moses
set
before
the
children
of
Deu4:45
These
are
the
and
the
and
the
which
Moses
spake
unto
the
children
of
after
they
c
ame
forth
out
of
Deu4:46
On
this
side
in
the
valley
over
against
Bethpeor,
in
the
land
of
Sihon
king
of
the
Amorites,
who
dwelt
at
Heshbon,
whom
Moses
and
the
children
of
Israel
after
they
were
come
forth
out
of
Deu4:47
And
they
possessed
his
and
the
land
of
Og
king
of
two
kings
of
the
Amorites,
which
were
on
this
side
Jordan
t
oward
the
sunrising;
Deu4:48
From
Aroer,
which
is
by
the
bank
of
the
river
Arnon,
even
unto
mount
which
is
Deu4:49
And
all
the
plain
on
this
side
Jordan
even
unto
the
sea
of
the
under
the
springs
of
Deu5:1
And
Moses
called
all
and
said
unto
O
the
statutes
and
judgments
which
I
speak
in
your
ears
this
that
ye
may
learn
and
and
do
Deu5:2
The
LORD
our
God
made
a
covenant
with
us
in
Deu5:3
The
LORD
made
not
this
covenant
with
our
but
with
even
who
are
all
of
us
here
alive
this
Deu5:4
The
LORD
talked
with
you
face
to
face
in
the
mount
out
of
the
midst
of
the
Deu5:5
(I
stood
between
the
LORD
and
you
at
that
to
shew
you
the
word
of
the
for
ye
were
afraid
by
reason
of
the
and
went
not
up
into
the
mount;)
Deu5:6
I
am
the
LORD
thy
which
brought
thee
out
of
the
land
of
from
the
house
of
Deu5:7
Thou
shalt
have
none

Thou

Thou
shalt
not
bow
down
thyself
unto

the

thy
God
am
a
jealous
visiting
the
iniquity
of
the
fathers
upon
the
children
unto
the
third

fourth
generation
of
them
that
hate
Deu5:10
And
shewing
mercy
unto
thousands
of
them
that
love
me

Thou
shalt
not
take

Keep

hath
commanded
Deu5:13
Six

But
the
seventh

is

And
remember
that

that

brought

out
thence
through

These
words
the
LORD
spake
unto
all
your
assembly
in
the
mount
out
of
the
midst
of
the
of

of
the
thick
with
a

he
added
no
And
he
wrote
them
in
two
tables
of
and
delivered
them
unto
Deu5:23
And
it
came
to
when
ye
heard
the
voice
out
of
the
midst
of
the
(for
the
mountain
did
burn
with
fire,)
that
ye
came
near
unto
even
all
the
heads
of
your
and
your
Deu5:24
And
ye
the
LORD
our
God
hath
shewed
us
his
glory
and

we
have
heard
his
voice
out
of
the

of
the

have
seen
this
day
that
God
doth
talk
with

Deu5:25
Now
therefore
why
should

for
this
great
fire
will
consume
if
we
hear
the

our
God
any

For
who
is
there
of
all

all
that
the

will
hear

Deu5:28
And
the
LORD
heard
the
voice
of
your

ye
spake
unto
and
the
LORD
said
unto
I
have
heard
the
voice
of
the
words
of
this
which
they
have
spoken
unto
they
have
well
said
all
that
they

Deu5:29
O
that
there
were
such
an

in
that
they
would
fear

keep
all
my

that

Ye

Thou

the
and
the
and
the
which
the
LORD
our
God
hath
commanded
Deu6:21
Then
thou
shalt
say
unto
thy
We
were
Pharaoh's
bondmen
in
and
the
LORD
brought
us
out
of
Egypt
with
a
mighty
ha
Deu6:22
And
the
LORD
shewed
signs
and
great
and
upon
upon
and
upon
all
his
before
our
eye
s:
Deu6:23
And
he
brought
us
out
from
that
he
might
bring
us
to
give
us
the
land
which
he
sware
unto
our
Deu6:24
And
the
LORD
commanded
us
to
do
all
these
to
fear
the
LORD
our
for
our
good
that
he
might
preserve
u
s
as
it
is
at
this
Deu6:25
And
it
shall
be
our
if
we
observe
to
do
all
these
commandments
before
the
LORD
our
as
he
hath
commanded
Deu7:1
When
the
LORD
thy
God
shall
bring
thee
into
the
land
whither
thou
goest
to
possess
and
hath
cast
out
many
nations
before
the
Hittites,
and
the
Girgashites,
and
the
Amorites,
and
the
Canaanites,
and
the
Perizzites,
and
the
Hivites,
and
the
Jebusi
tes,
seven
nations
greater
and
mightier
than
Deu7:2
And
when
the
LORD
thy
God
shall
deliver
them
before
thou
shalt
smite
and
utterly
destroy
thou
shalt
make
n
o
covenant
with
nor
shew
mercy
unto
Deu7:3
Neither
shalt
thou
make
marriages
with
thy
daughter
thou
shalt
not
give
unto
his
nor
his
daughter
shalt
thou
take
unto
thy
Deu7:4
For
they
will
turn
away
thy
son
from
following
that
they
may
serve
other
so
will
the
anger
of
the
LORD
be
kindled
against
and
destroy
thee
Deu7:5
But
thus
shall
ye
deal
with
ye
shall
destroy
their
and
break
down
their
and
cut
down
their
and
burn
their
graven
images
with
Deu7:6
For
thou
art
an
holy
people
unto
the
LORD
thy
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
chosen
thee
to
be
a
special
people
unto
ab

all
people
that
are
upon
the
face
of
the
Deu7:7
The
LORD
did
not
set
his
love
upon
nor
choose
because
ye
were
more
in
number
than
any
for
ye
were
the
fewe
st
of
all
Deu7:8
But
because
the
LORD
loved
and
because
he
would
keep
the
oath
which
he
had
sworn
unto
your
hath
the
LORD
broug
ht
you
out
with
a
mighty
and
redeemed
you
out
of
the
house
of
bondmen,
from
the
hand
of
Pharaoh
king
of
Deu7:9
Know
therefore
that
the
LORD
thy
he
is
the
faithful
which
keepeth
covenant
and
mercy
with
them
that
love
him
and
keep
his
commandments
to
a
thousand
Deu7:10
And
repayeth
them
that
hate
him
to
their
to
destroy
he
will
not
be
slack
to
him
that
hateth
he
will
repay
him
to
his
Deu7:11
Thou
shalt
therefore
keep
the
and
the
and
the
which
I
command
thee
this
to
do
Deu7:12
Wherefore
it
shall
come
to
if
ye
hearken
to
these
and
and
do
that
the
LORD
thy
God
shall
keep
unto
thee
the
covenant
and
the
mercy
which
he
sware
unto
thy
Deu7:13
And
he
will
love
and
bless
and
multiply
he
will
also
bless
the
fruit
of
thy

the
fruit
of
thy

increase
of
thy
and
the

of
thy
in
the
land
which
he
sware
unto
t

Thou
shalt
be
blessed
above
all
there
shall
not
be
male
or

among
your

And
the
LORD
will
take
away
from
thee
all
and
will
put
none
of
the
evil
diseases
of
which
thou
knowest,
up
on
but
will
lay
them
upon
all
them
that
hate

And
thou
shalt
consume
all
the
people
which
the
LORD
thy
God
shall
deliver
thine
eye
shall
have
no
pity
upon

shalt
thou
serve
their
for
that
will
be
a
snare
unto
Deu7:17
If
thou
shalt
say
in
thine
These
nations
are
more
than
how
can
I
dispossess
Deu7:18
Thou
shalt
not
be
afraid
of
but
shalt
well
remember
what
the
LORD
thy
God
did
unto
and
unto
all
Deu7:19
The
great
temptations
which
thine
eyes

the
mighty

whereby
the

the
LORD

Moreover

Thou
shalt
not

the

and
Deu7:22
And
the
LORD

mayest
not

But

All

I
command

observe
to
that
ye
may
and
and
go
in
and
pos

land
which
the
LORD
sware
unto
your

And
thou
shalt
remember
all
the
way
which
the
LORD
thy
God
led
thee
these
forty
years
in
the
to
humble
and
to
prove
to
know
what
was
in
thine
whether
thou
wouldest
keep
his
or
Deu8:3
And
he
humbled
and
suffered
thee
to
and
fed
thee
with
which
thou
knewest
neither
did
thy
fathers
k
that
he
might
make
thee
know
that
man
doth
not

by
bread
but
by
every
word
that
proceedeth
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
L

Deu8:4
Thy
raiment
waxed
not
old
upon
neither
did
thy
foot

forty

Thou
shalt
also
consider
in
thine
as
a
man
chasteneth
his
so
the
LORD
thy
God
chasteneth
Deu8:6
Therefore
thou
shalt
keep
the
commandments
of
the
LORD
thy
to
walk
in
his
and
to
fear
Deu8:7
For
the
LORD
thy
God
bringeth
thee
into
a
good
a
land
of
brooks
of
of
fountains
and
depths
that
spring
out
of
v
alleys
and
Deu8:8
A
land
of
and
and
and
fig
and
pomegranates;
a
land
of
oil
and
Deu8:9
A
land
wherein
thou
shalt
eat
bread
without
thou
shalt
not
lack
any
thing
in
a
land
whose
stones
are
a
nd
out
of
whose
hills
thou
mayest
dig
Deu8:10
When
thou
hast
eaten
and
art
then
thou
shalt
bless
the
LORD
thy
God
for
the
good
land
which
he
hath
given
Deu8:11
Beware
that
thou
forget
not
the
LORD
thy
in
not
keeping
his
and
his
and
his
which
I
command
thee
this
Deu8:12
Lest
when
thou
hast
eaten
and
art
and
hast
built
goodly
and
dwelt
Deu8:13
And
when
thy
herds
and
thy
flocks
and
thy
silver
and
thy
gold
is
and
all
that
thou
hast
is
multiplied
;
Deu8:14
Then
thine
heart
be
lifted
and
thou
forget
the
LORD
thy
which
brought
thee
forth
out
of
the
land
of
from
th
e
house
of
Deu8:15
Who
led
thee
through
that
great
and
terrible
wherein
were
fiery
and
and
where
the
re
was
no
who
brought
thee
forth
water
out
of
the
rock
of
Deu8:16
Who
fed
thee
in
the
wilderness
with
which
thy
fathers
knew
that
he
might
humble
and
that
he
might
prove

to
do
thee
good

thy
latter
Deu8:17
And

say
in
thine
My
power
and
the
might
of
mine
hand
hath
gotten
me
this
Deu8:18
But
thou
shalt
remember
the
LORD
thy
for
it
is
he
that
giveth
thee
power
to
get
that
he
may
establish
his
cove
nant
which
he
sware
unto
thy
as
it
is
this
Deu8:19
And
it
shall
if
thou
do
at
all
forget
the
LORD
thy
and
walk
after
other
and
serve
and
worship
I
testify
against
you
this
day
that
ye
shall
surely
Deu8:20
As
the
nations
which
the
LORD
destroyeth
before
your
so
shall
ye
because
ye
would
not
be
obedient
unto
the
vo
ice
of
the
LORD
your
Deu9:1
O
Thou
art
to
pass
over
Jordan
this
to
go
in
to
possess
nations
greater
and
mightier
than
cities
great
and
fenced
up
to
Deu9:2
A
people
great
and
the
children
of
the
Anakims,
whom
thou
knowest,
and
of
whom
thou
hast
heard
Who
can
stand
befo
re
the
children
of
Deu9:3
Understand
therefore
this
that
the
LORD
thy
God
is
he
which
goeth
over
before
as
a
consuming
fire
he
shall
destro
y
and
he
shall
bring
them
down
before
thy
so
shalt
thou
drive
them
and
destroy
them
as
the
LORD
hath
said
unto
Deu9:4
Speak
not
thou
in
thine
after
that
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
cast
them
out
from
before
For
my
righteousness
the
LORD
hath
brought
me
in
to
possess
this
but
for
the
wickedness
of
these
nations
the
LORD
doth
drive
them
out
from
before
Deu9:5
Not
for
thy
or
for
the
uprightness
of
thine
dost
thou
go
to
possess
their
but
for
the
wickedness
of
these
nations
the
LORD
thy
God
doth
drive
them
out
from
before
and
that
he
may
perform
the
word
which
the
LORD
sware
unto
thy
and
Deu9:6
Understand
that
the
LORD
thy
God
giveth
thee
not
this
good
land
to
possess
it
for
thy
for
thou
art
a
stiffnecked
Deu9:7
and
forget
how
thou
provokedst
the
LORD
thy
God
to
wrath
in
the
from
the
day
that
thou
didst
depa
rt
out
of
the
land
of
until
ye
came
unto
this
ye
have
been
rebellious
against
the
Deu9:8
Also
in
Horeb
ye
provoked
the
LORD
to
so
that
the
LORD
was
angry
with
you
to
have
destroyed
Deu9:9
When
I
was
gone
up
into
the
mount
to
receive
the
tables
of
even
the
tables
of
the
covenant
which
the
LORD
made
with
y
ou,
then
I
abode
in
the
mount
forty
days
and
forty
I
neither
did
eat
bread
nor
drink
Deu9:10
And
the
LORD
delivered
unto
me
two
tables
of
stone
written
with
the
finger
of
and
on
them
was
written
according
to
all
the
which
the
LORD
spake
with
you
in
the
mount
out
of
the
midst
of
the
fire
in
the
day
of
the
Deu9:11
And
it
came
to
pass
at
the
end
of
forty
days
and
forty
that
the
LORD
gave
me
the
two
tables
of
even
the
tabl
es
of
the
Deu9:12
And
the
LORD
said
unto
get
thee
down
quickly
from
for
thy
people
which
thou
hast
brought
forth
out
of
Egy
pt
have
corrupted
they
are
quickly
turned
aside
out
of
the
way
which
I
commanded
they
have
made
them
a
molten
ima
Deu9:13
Furthermore
the
LORD
spake
unto
I
have
seen
this
it
is
a
stiffnecked
Deu9:14
Let
me
that
I
may
destroy
and
blot
out
their
name
from
under
and
I
will
make
of
thee
a
nation
mightier
and
greater
than
Deu9:15
So
I
turned
and
came
down
from
the
and
the
mount
burned
with
and
the
two
tables
of
the
covenant
were
in
my
two
Deu9:16
And
I
ye
had
sinned
against
the
LORD
your
and
had
made
you
a
molten
ye
had
turned
aside
qui
ckly
out
of
the
way
which
the
LORD
had
commanded
Deu9:17
And
I
took
the
two
and
cast
them
out
of
my
two
and
brake
them
before
your
Deu9:18
And
I
fell
down
before
the
as
at
the
forty
days
and
forty
I
did
neither
eat
nor
drink
be
cause
of
all
your
sins
which
ye
in
doing
wickedly
in
the
sight
of
the
to
provoke
him
to
Deu9:19
For
I
was
afraid
of
the
anger
and
hot
wherewith
the
LORD
was
wroth
against
you
to
destroy
But
the
LORD
he
arkened
unto
me
at
that
time
Deu9:20
And
the
LORD
was
very
angry
with
Aaron
to
have
destroyed
and
I
prayed
for
Aaron
also
the
same
Deu9:21
And
I
took
your
the
calf
which
ye
had
and
burnt
it
with
and
stamped
and
ground
it
very
even
unt
il
it
was
as
small
as
and
I
cast
the
dust
thereof
into
the
brook
that
descended
out
of
the
Deu9:22
And
at
Taberah,
and
at
Massah,
and
at
Kibrothhattaavah,
ye
provoked
the
LORD
to
Deu9:23
Likewise
when
the
LORD
sent
you
from
Kadeshbarnea,
Go
up
and
possess
the
land
which
I
have
given
then
ye
rebel
led
against
the
commandment
of
the
LORD
your
and
ye
believed
him
nor
hearkened
to
his
Deu9:24
Ye
have
been
rebellious
against
the
LORD
from
the
day
that
I
knew
Deu9:25
Thus
I
fell
down
before
the
LORD
forty
days
and
forty
as
I
fell
down
at
the
because
the
LORD
had
said
he
wou
ld
destroy
Deu9:26
I
prayed
therefore
unto
the
and
O
Lord
destroy
not
thy
people
and
thine
which
thou
hast
redee
med
through
thy
which
thou
hast
brought
forth
out
of
Egypt
with
a
mighty
Deu9:27
Remember
thy
and
look
not
unto
the
stubbornness
of
this
nor
to
their
n
or
to
their
Deu9:28
Lest
the
land
whence
thou
broughtest
us
out
Because
the
LORD
was
not
able
to
bring
them
into
the
land
which
he
promise
d
and
because
he
hated
he
hath
brought
them
out
to
slay
them
in
the
Deu9:29
Yet
they
are
thy
people
and
thine
which
thou
broughtest
out
by
thy
mighty
power
and
by
thy
stretched
out
Deu10:1
At
that
time
the
LORD
said
unto
Hew
thee
two
tables
of
stone
like
unto
the
and
come
up
unto
me
into
the
a
nd
make
thee
an
ark
of
Deu10:2
And
I
will
write
on
the
tables
the
words
that
were
in
the
first
tables
which
thou
brakest,
and
thou
shalt
put
them
in
the
a
rk.
Deu10:3
And
I
made
an
ark
of
shittim
and
hewed
two
tables
of
stone
like
unto
the
and
went
up
into
the
having
th
e
two
tables
in
mine
Deu10:4
And
he
wrote
on
the
according
to
the
first
the
ten
which
the
LORD
spake
unto
you
in
the
moun
t
out
of
the
midst
of
the
fire
in
the
day
of
the
and
the
LORD
gave
them
unto
Deu10:5
And
I
turned
myself
and
came
down
from
the
and
put
the
tables
in
the
ark
which
I
had
and
there
they
as
the
LORD
commanded
Deu10:6
And
the
children
of
Israel
took
their
journey
from
Beeroth
of
the
children
of
Jaakan
to
Mosera:
there
Aaron
and
there
he
was
and
Eleazar
his
son
ministered
in
the
priest's
office
in
his
Deu10:7
From
thence
they
journeyed
unto
Gudgodah;
and
from
Gudgodah
to
Jotbath,
a
land
of
rivers
of
Deu10:8
At
that
time
the
LORD
separated
the
tribe
of
to
bear
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
to
stand
before
the
LORD
to
minister
unto
and
to
bless
in
his
unto
this
Deu10:9
Wherefore

as
the
LORD
thy
God
p
romised
Deu10:10
And
I
stayed
in
the

the
first
forty
days
and
forty
and
the
LORD
hearkened
unto
me
at
tha
t

And

To

the
heaven
of

the
LORD's

with
all
that
therein
Deu10:15
Only
the
LORD
had
a
delight
in
thy
fathers
to
love
and
he
chose
their
seed
after
even
you
above
all
as
it
is
this
Deu10:16
Circumcise
therefore
the
foreskin
of
your

be
no
more
stiffnecked.
Deu10:17
For
the
LORD
your
God
is
God
of
and
Lord
of
a
great
a
and
a
which
regardeth
not

judgment
of
the
fatherless

and
loveth

and
Deu10:19
Love
ye
therefore
the
for

were
strangers
in
the
land
of
Deu10:20
Thou
shalt
fear
the
LORD
thy
him
shalt
thou
and
to
him
shalt
thou
and
swear
by
his
Deu10:21
He
is
thy
and
he
is
thy
that
hath
done
for
thee
these
great
and
terrible
which
thine
eyes
have
Deu10:22
Thy
fathers
went
down
into
Egypt
with
threescore
and
ten
and
now
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
made
thee
as
the
stars
of
heaven
for
Deu11:1
Therefore
thou
shalt
love
the
LORD
thy
and
keep
his
and
his
and
his
and
his
Deu11:2
And
know
ye
this
for
I
speak
not
with
your
children
which
have
not
and
which
have
not
seen
the
chastisement
of
the
LORD
your
his
his
mighty
and
his
stretched
out
Deu11:3
And
his
and
his
which
he
did
in
the
midst
of
Egypt
unto
Pharaoh
the
king
of
and
unto
all
his
Deu11:4
And
what
he
did
unto
the
army
of
unto
their
and
to
their
how
he
made
the
water
of
the
Red
sea
to
o
verflow
them
as
they
pursued
after
and
how
the
LORD
hath
destroyed
them
unto
this
Deu11:5
And
what
he
did
unto
you
in
the
until
ye
came
into
this
Deu11:6
And
what
he
did
unto
Dathan
and
Abiram,
the
sons
of
Eliab,
the
son
of
how
the
earth
opened
her
and
swallowed
them
and
their
and
their
and
all
the
substance
that
was
in
their
in
the
midst
of
all
Deu11:7
But
your
eyes
have
seen
all
the
great
acts
of
the
LORD
which
he
Deu11:8
Therefore
shall
ye
keep
all
the
commandments
which
I
command
you
this
that
ye
may
be
and
go
in
and
possess
the
whither
ye
go
to
possess
Deu11:9
And
that
ye
may
prolong
your
days
in
the
which
the
LORD
sware
unto
your
fathers
to
give
unto
them
and
to
their
a
land
that
floweth
with
milk
and
Deu11:10
For
the
whither
thou
goest
in
to
possess
is
not
as
the
land
of
from
whence
ye
came
where
thou
soweds
t
thy
and
wateredst
it
with
thy
as
a
garden
of
Deu11:11
But
the
whither
ye
go
to
possess
is
a
land
of
hills
and
and
drinketh
water
of
the
rain
of
Deu11:12
A
land
which
the
LORD
thy
God
careth
the
eyes
of
the
LORD
thy
God
are
always
upon
from
the
beginning
of
the
year
even
unto
the
end
of
the
Deu11:13
And
it
shall
come
to
if
ye
shall
hearken
diligently
unto
my
commandments
which
I
command
you
this
to
love
the
L
ORD
your
and
to
serve
him
with
all
your
heart
and
with
all
your
Deu11:14
That
I
will
give
you
the
rain
of
your
land
in
his
due
the
first
rain
and
the
latter
that
thou
mayest
gather
in
thy
and
thy
and
thine
Deu11:15
And
I
will
send
grass
in
thy
fields
for
thy
that
thou
mayest
eat
and
be
Deu11:16
Take
heed
to
that
your
heart
be
not
and
ye
turn
and
serve
other
and
worship
Deu11:17
And
then
the
LORD's
wrath
be
kindled
against
and
he
shut
up
the
that
there
be
no
and
that
the
land
yiel
d
not
her
and
lest
ye
perish
quickly
from
off
the
good
land
which
the
LORD
giveth
Deu11:18
Therefore
shall
ye
lay
up
these
my
words
in
your
heart
and
in
your
and
bind
them
for
a
sign
upon
your
that
the
y
may
be
as
frontlets
between
your
Deu11:19
And
ye
shall
teach
them
your
speaking
of
them
when
thou
sittest
in
thine
and
when
thou
walkest
by
the
way
,
when
thou
liest
and
when
thou
risest
Deu11:20
And
thou
shalt
write
them
upon
the
door
posts
of
thine
and
upon
thy
Deu11:21
That
your
days
may
be
and
the
days
of
your
in
the
land
which
the
LORD
sware
unto
your
fathers
to
giv
e
as
the
days
of
heaven
upon
the
Deu11:22
For
if
ye
shall
diligently
keep
all
these
commandments
which
I
command
to
do
to
love
the
LORD
your
to
walk
in
all
his
and
to
cleave
unto
Deu11:23
Then
will
the
LORD
drive
out
all
these
nations
from
before
and
ye
shall
possess
greater
nations
and
mightier
than
you
rselves.
Deu11:24
Every
place
whereon
the
soles
of
your
feet
shall
tread
shall
be
from
the
wilderness
and
from
the
th
e
river
even
unto
the
uttermost
sea
shall
your
coast
Deu11:25
There
shall
no
man
be
able
to
stand
before
for
the
LORD
your
God
shall
lay
the
fear
of
you
and
the
dread
of
you
upon
all
the
land
that
ye
shall
tread
as
he
hath
said
unto
Deu11:26
I
set
before
you
this
day
a
blessing
and
a
Deu11:27
A
if
ye
obey
the
commandments
of
the
LORD
your
which
I
command
you
this
Deu11:28
And
a
if
ye
will
not
obey
the
commandments
of
the
LORD
your
but
turn
aside
out
of
the
way
which
I
command
you
this
to
go
after
other
which
ye
have
not
Deu11:29
And
it
shall
come
to
when
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
brought
thee
in
unto
the
land
whither
thou
goest
to
possess
that
thou
shalt
put
the
blessing
upon
mount
Gerizim,
and
the
curse
upon
mount
Ebal.
Deu11:30
Are
they
not
on
the
other
side
by
the
way
where
the
sun
goeth
in
the
land
of
the
Canaanites,
which
dwell
in
the
champaign
over
against
Gilgal,
beside
the
plains
of
Moreh?
Deu11:31
For
ye
shall
pass
over
Jordan
to
go
in
to
possess
the
land
which
the
LORD
your
God
giveth
and
ye
shall
possess
an

Deu11:32
And
ye
shall
observe
to
do
all
the
statutes
and
judgments
which
I
set
before
you
this
Deu12:1
These
are
the
statutes
and
which
ye
shall
observe
to
do
in
the
which
the
LORD
God
of
thy
fathers
giveth
th
ee
to
possess
all
the
days
that
ye
live
upon
the
Deu12:2
Ye
shall
utterly
destroy
all
the
wherein
the
nations
which
ye
shall
possess
served
their
upon
the
high
mounta
and
upon
the
and
under
every
green
Deu12:3
And
ye
shall
overthrow
their
and
break
their
and
burn
their
groves
with
and
ye
shall
hew
down
the
gr
aven
images
of
their
and
destroy
the
names
of
them
out
of
that
Deu12:4
Ye
shall
not
do
so
unto
the
LORD
your
Deu12:5
But
unto
the
place
which
the
LORD
your
God
shall
choose
out
of
all
your
tribes
to
put
his
name
even
unto
his
habitat

ye
and
thither
thou

And
thither
ye
shall
bring
your
burnt

heave
offerings
of
your
an
d

your
freewill
and
the
firstlings
of
your
herds
and
of
your
Deu12:7
And
there
ye
shall
eat
before
the
LORD
your
and
ye
shall
rejoice
in
all
that
ye
put
your
hand

and
your
househ

wherein
the
LORD
thy
God
hath
blessed
Deu12:8
Ye
shall
not
do
after
all
the
things
that
we
do
here
this
every
man
whatsoever
is
right
in
his
own
Deu12:9
For
ye
are
not
as
yet
come
to
the
rest
and
to
the
which
the
LORD
your
God
giveth
Deu12:10
But
when
ye
go
over
and
dwell
in
the
land
which
the
LORD
your
God
giveth
you
to
and
when
he
giveth
you
re

all
your
enemies
round
so
that

Deu12:11
Then
there
shall
be
a
place

the
LORD
your
God
shall
choose
to
cause
his
name
to
dwell
thither
shall
ye
bring
all
that
I
command
your

offering
of
your

all
your

Take
heed
to
thyself
that
thou
offer
not
thy
burnt
offerings
in
every
place
that
thou
seest:
Deu12:14
But
in
the
place
which

Notwithstanding

When

If

Deu12:22
Even

Also

These
are
the
words
of
the
which
the
LORD
commanded
Moses
to
make
with
the
children
of
Israel
in
the
land
of
Moab
,
beside
the
covenant
which
he
made
with
them
in
Deu29:2
And
Moses
called
unto
all
and
said
unto
Ye
have
seen
all
that
the
LORD
did
before
your
eyes
in
the
land
of
Eg

unto
all
his
and
unto
all
his
Deu29:3
The
great
temptations
which
thine
eyes
have
the
and
those
great
Deu29:4
Yet
the
LORD
hath
not
given
you
an
heart
to

eyes
to

ears
to
unto
this
Deu29:5
And
I
have
led
you
forty
years
in
the
your
clothes
are
not
waxen
old
upon

thy
shoe
is
not
waxen
old
up
on
thy

Ye
have
not
eaten
neither
have
ye
drunk
wine
or
strong
that
ye
might
know
that
I
am
the
LORD
your

And
when
ye
came
unto
this
Sihon
the
king
of
Heshbon,
and
Og
the
king
of

out
against
us
unto
an

smote
Deu29:8
And
we
took

inheritance
unto
the
Reubenites,

to
the
Gadites,

to
the
half

Deu29:9
Keep
therefore
the
words
of
this

That
thou
shouldest
enter
into
covenant
with
the
LORD
thy

into
his
which
the
LORD
thy
God
maketh
with
thee
this
Deu29:13
That

establish
thee
to

for
a

said
unto
thee

as
he
hath

unto
thy
to
to

to
Deu29:14
Neither
with
you

do
I
make
this
covenant

this
Deu29:15
But
with
him
that

this

before

Lest

this

from

I

then
the
anger
of

LORD
and
his
jealousy
shall
smoke
against
that

all
the
cur

that
are
written
in

lie
upon

blot
out

Deu29:22
So
that

up
after

the
stranger
that
shall
come
from

the
plagues

Then
men

Because
they
have
forsaken
the
covenant
of
the
LORD
God
of
their
which
he
made
with
them
when
he
brought
them
forth
out
of
the
land
of
Deu29:26
For
they
went
and
served
other
and
worshipped
gods
whom
they
knew
and
whom
he
had
not
given
unto
Deu29:27
And
the
anger
of
the
LORD
was
kindled
against
this
to
bring
upon
it
all
the
curses
that
are
written
in

Deu29:28
And
the
LORD
rooted
them
out
of
their
land
in

in

in

cast
them
into
another

as
it
is

Deu29:29
The
secret
things
belong
unto
the
LORD
our
but
those
things
which
are
revealed
belong
unto
us
and
to
our
children
for
that
we
may
do
all
the
words
of

Deu30:1
And
it
shall
come
to
when
all
these
things
are

I

If
any

all
thine

will
put
all

that
hate

persecuted
Deu30:8
And
thou
shalt
return

obey
the
voice
of

do
all
his
commandments
which
I
command

Deu30:9
And

will
again
rejoice
over

Deu30:10
If
thou
shalt
hearken
unto
the
voice
of
the
LORD
thy
to
keep

which
are
written
in

if
thou
turn
unto

with
all
thine

with
all
thy

For
this
commandment
which
I
command
thee
this
it
is
not
hidden
from
neither
is
it
far
Deu30:12
It
is
not
in
that
thou
shouldest
Who
shall
go
up
for
us
to
and
bring
it
unto
that
we
may
hear
and
do
Deu30:13
Neither
is
it
beyond
the
that
thou
shouldest
Who
shall
go
over
the
sea
for
and
bring
it
unto
that
we
may
hear
and
do
Deu30:14
But
the
word
is
very
nigh
unto
in
thy
and
in
thy
that
thou
mayest
do
Deu30:15
I
have
set
before
thee
this
day
life
and
and
death
and
Deu30:16
In
that
I
command
thee
this
day
to
love
the
LORD
thy
to
walk
in
his

to
keep
his
commandments
and
his
statut

shall
bless
thee
in

whither
thou
goest
to

But
if
thine
heart
turn
so
that
thou
wilt
not
but
shalt
be
drawn
and
worship
other
and
serve
Deu30:18
I
denounce
unto
you
this
that
ye
shall
surely
and
that
ye
shall
not
prolong
your
days
upon
the
whither
thou
passest
over
Jordan
to
go
to
possess
Deu30:19
I
call
heaven
and
earth
to
record
this
day
against
that
I
have
set
before
you
life
and
blessing
and
t
herefore
choose
that
both
thou

thy
seed
may

That
thou
mayest
love
the

obey
his
and
that
thou

the
LORD
sware
unto
thy

And
Moses
went
and
spake
these
words
unto
all
Deu31:2
And
he
said
unto
I
am
an
hundred
and
twenty
years
old
this
I
can
no
more
go
out
and
come

the
LORD
hath
said
unto
Thou

not
go

Deu31:3
The

go
over
before

he
will
destroy
these
nations
from

thou
shalt
possess

he
shall
go
over
before
as
the
LORD
hath
Deu31:4
And
the
LORD
shall
do
unto
them
as
he
did
to
Sihon
and
to
Og,
kings
of
the
Amorites,
and
unto
the
land
of
whom
he
des
troyed.
Deu31:5
And
the
LORD
shall
give
them
up
before
your

ye
may
do
unto
them
according
unto
all
the
commandments
which
I

Deu31:6
Be

And
Moses
called
unto
and
said
unto
him
in
the
sight
of
all
Be
strong
and
of
a
good
for
thou
must
go
with
this
people
unto
the
land
which
the
LORD
hath
sworn
unto
their
fathers
to
give
and
thou
shalt
cause
them
to

Deu31:8
And

go

will
not

Moses

delivered
it

Deu31:16
And
the

said
unto

they
go
to

among
and
will
forsake

break

covenant
which
I
hav

made
with
Deu31:17
Then
my
anger
shall
be
kindled
against
them
in
that
and
I
will
forsake
and
I
will
hide
my

from

And
I
will

that
day
for
all
the
evils
which
they
shall
have
in
that
they

Now
therefore
write

this
song
for

teach
it

it
in

this
song
may
be
a

against

For

And

out

sware.
Deu31:22
Moses
therefore
wrote
this
song
the
same
and
taught
it
the
children
of
Deu31:23
And
he
gave
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun

Be

bring
the
children
o

Israel
into
the
land
which
I
sware
unto
and
I
will
be
with
Deu31:24
And
it
came
to
when
Moses
had
made
an
end
of
writing
the
words
of
this
law
in
a
until
they
were
Deu31:25
That
Moses
commanded
the
Levites,
which
bare
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
Deu31:26
Take
this
book
of

and
put
it
in
the

of

ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
LORD
your
that
it
may
be
there
fo
r
a
witness
against
Deu31:27
For
I
know
thy
and
thy
stiff
while
I
am
yet
alive
with
you
this
ye
have
been
rebellious
agai
nst
the
and
how
much
more
after
my
Deu31:28
Gather
unto
me
all
the
elders
of
your
and
your
that
I
may
speak
these
words
in
their
and
call
heav
en
and
earth
to
record
against
Deu31:29
For
I
know
that
after
my
death
ye
will
utterly
corrupt
and
turn
aside
from
the
way
which
I
have
commanded
and
evil
will
befall
you
in
the
latter
because
ye
will
do
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
to
provoke
him
to
anger
through
the
work
of
your
Deu31:30
And
Moses
spake
in
the
ears
of
all
the
congregation
of
Israel
the
words
of
this
until
they
were
Deu32:1
Give
O
ye

I
will
and
O
the
words
of
my
Deu32:2
My
doctrine
shall

shall
distil
as
the
as
the
small
rain
upon

as

upon

Deu32:3
Because
I
will
publish
the
name
of
the

greatness
unto

Deu32:4
He

of

and
without

and
right
is
Deu32:5
They
have
corrupted
their
spot
is
not
the
spot
of
his
they
are
a
perverse
and
crooked
Deu32:6
Do
ye
thus
requite
the
O
foolish
people
and
is
not
he
thy
father
that
hath
bought
hath
he
not
made
thee

and
established
Deu32:7
Remember
the
days
of

When
the
Most

he
separated
the
sons
of

set
the
bounds
of
the
p

according
to
the
number
of
the
children
of
Deu32:9
For
the
LORD's
portion
is
his
Jacob
is
the
lot
of
his
Deu32:10
He
found
him
in
a
desert
and
in
the
waste
howling
he
led
him
he
instructed
he
kept
him
as

Deu32:12
So
the
LORD
alone
did
lead
and
there
was
no
strange
god
with
Deu32:13
He
made
him
ride
on
the
high
places
of
the
that
he
might
eat

he
made
him

They

They

Of

And
when

And
he
I

They

And
Moses

And
Moses

And
the

Deu34:1
And
Moses
went
up
from
the
plains
of
Moab
unto
the
mountain
of
to
the
top
of
that
is
over
against
An
d
the
LORD
shewed
him
all
the
land
of
unto
Deu34:2
And
all
and
the
land
of

and
all
the
land
of
unto
the
utmost
Deu34:3
And
the
and
the
plain
of
the
valley
of
the
city
of
palm
unto
Zoar.
Deu34:4
And
the
LORD
said
unto
This
is
the
land
which
I
sware
unto
unto
and
unto
I
will
give
it
unto
thy
I
have
caused
thee
to
see
it
with
thine
but
thou
shalt
not
go
over
Deu34:5
So
Moses
the
servant
of
the
LORD
died
there
in
the
land
of
according
to
the
word
of
the
Deu34:6
And
he
buried
him
in
a
valley
in
the
land
of
over
against
Bethpeor:
but
no
man
knoweth
of
his
sepulchre
unto
this
day
.
Deu34:7
And
Moses
was
an
hundred
and
twenty
years
old
when
he
his
eye
was
not
nor
his
natural
force
Deu34:8
And
the
children
of
Israel
wept
for
Moses
in
the
plains
of
Moab
thirty
so
the
days
of
weeping
and
mourning
for
Moses
were
Deu34:9
And
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun
was
full
of
the
spirit
of
for
Moses
had
laid
his
hands
upon
and
the
children
of
Isra
el
hearkened
unto
and
did
as
the
LORD
commanded
Deu34:10
And
there
arose
not
a
prophet
since
in
Israel
like
unto
whom
the
LORD
knew
face
to
Deu34:11
In
all
the
signs
and
the
which
the
LORD
sent
him
to
do
in
the
land
of
Egypt
to
and
to
all
his
and
to
all
his
Deu34:12
And
in
all
that
mighty
and
in
all
the
great
terror
which
Moses
shewed
in
the
sight
of
all
Josh1:1
Now
after
the
death
of
Moses
the
servant
of
the
LORD
it
came
to
that
the
LORD
spake
unto
Joshua
the
son
of

Josh1:8
This

and
that

Then
Joshua
commanded

of

answered

those
twelve
which
they
took
out
of
did
Joshua
pitch
in
Gilgal.
Josh4:21
And
he
spake
unto
the
children
of
When
your
children
shall
ask
their
fathers
in
time
to
What
mean
these
Josh4:22
Then
ye
shall
let
your
children
Israel
came
over
this
Jordan
on
dry
Josh4:23
For
the
LORD
your
God
dried
up
the
waters
of
Jordan
from
before
until
ye
were
passed
as
the
LORD
your
God
did
t
o
the
Red
which
he
dried
up
from
before
until
we
were
gone
Josh4:24
That
all
the
people
of
the
earth
might
know
the
hand
of
the
that
it
is
that
ye
might
fear
the
LORD
your
God
for
Josh5:1
And
it
came
to
when
all
the
kings
of
the
Amorites,
which
were
on
the
side
of
Jordan
and
all
the
kings
of
th
e
Canaanites,
which
were
by
the
heard
that
the
LORD
had
dried
up
the
waters
of
Jordan
from
before
the
children
of
unti
l
we
were
passed
that
their
heart
neither
was
there
spirit
in
them
any
because
of
the
children
of
Josh5:2
At
that
time
the
LORD
said
unto
Make
thee
sharp
and
circumcise
again
the
children
of
Israel
the
second
time
.
Josh5:3
And
Joshua
made
him
sharp
and
circumcised
the
children
of
Israel
at
the
hill
of
the
foreskins.
Josh5:4
And
this
is
the
cause
why
Joshua
did
All
the
people
that
came
out
of
that
were
even
all
the
men
o
f
died
in
the
wilderness
by
the
after
they
came
out
of
Josh5:5
Now
all
the
people
that
came
out
were
but
all
the
people
that
were
born
in
the
wilderness
by
the
way
as
they
c
ame
forth
out
of
them
they
had
not
Josh5:6
For
the
children
of
Israel
walked
forty
years
in
the
till
all
the
people
that
were
men
of
which
came
out
o

were
because
they
obeyed
not
the
voice
of
the
unto
whom
the
LORD
sware
that
he
would
not
shew
them
the
lan

which
the
LORD
sware
unto
their
fathers
that
he
would
give
a
land
that
floweth
with
milk
and
Josh5:7
And
their
whom
he
raised
up
in
their
them
Joshua
for
they
were
because
they
ha
d
not
circumcised
them
by
the
Josh5:8
And
it
came
to
when
they
had
done
circumcising
all
the
that
they
abode
in
their
places
in
the
till
they
were
Josh5:9
And
the
LORD
said
unto
This
day
have
I
rolled
away
the
reproach
of
Egypt
from

Wherefore
the
name
of
the
pl

called
Gilgal
unto
this
Josh5:10
And
the
children
of
Israel
encamped
in
Gilgal,
and
kept
the
passover
on
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
month
at
even
in
the
pla

of
Josh5:11
And
they
did
eat
of
the
old
corn
of
the
land
on
the
morrow
after
the
unleavened
and
parched
corn
in
the

And
the

after
they
had
eaten
of

the
children
of
Israel

they
did
eat
of
the
fruit
of
the
land
of
Canaan
that
Josh5:13
And
it
came
to
when
Joshua
was
by
that
he
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
there
stood
a
man
ove
r
against
him
with
his
sword
drawn
in
his
and
Joshua
went
unto
and
said
unto
Art
thou
for

for
our
adversarie

Josh5:14
And
he
but
as
captain
of
the
host
of

LORD

now
And
Joshua
fell
on
his
face
to
the
and
did
and
said
unto
What
saith
my
lord
unto
his
Josh5:15
And
the
captain
of
the
LORD's
host
said
unto
Loose
thy
shoe
from
off
thy

the
place
whereon
thou
standest

And
Joshua
did
Josh6:1
Now
Jericho
was
straitly
shut
up
because
of
the
children
of
none
went
and
none
came
Josh6:2
And
the
LORD
said
unto
I
have
given
into
thine
hand
and
the
king
and
the
mighty
men
of

Josh6:3
And
ye
shall
compass
the
all

men
of

go
round
about
the
city
Thus
shalt
thou
do
six
Josh6:4
And
seven
priests
shall
bear
before

trumpets
of

the
seventh
day
ye
shall
compass
the
city

and
the
priests
shall
blow
with
the
Josh6:5
And
it
shall
come
to
that
when
they
make
a
long
blast
with
the
ram's
and
when
ye
hear
the
sound
of
the
all
the
people
shall
shout
with
a
great
and
the
wall
of
the
city
shall
fall
down
and
the
people
shall
ascend
up
every
man
straight
before
Josh6:6
And
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun
called
the
and
said
unto
Take
up
the
ark
of
the
and
let
seven
priests
be

ark
of

Josh6:7
And
he
said
unto
the
Pass
and
compass
the
and
let
him
that
is
armed
pass
on
before
the
ark
of
the
Josh6:8
And
it
came
to
when
Joshua
had
spoken
unto
the
that
the
seven
priests
bearing
the
seven
trumpets
of
hor

passed
on
before

Josh6:9
And
the
armed

went
before

the
rereward
came
after

And
Joshua
had
commanded
the
Ye

out
of

Josh6:11
So
the
ark
of
the
LORD
compassed
the
going
about
it
and
they
came
into
the
and
lodged
in
the
Josh6:12
And
Joshua
rose
early
in
the
and
the
priests
took
up
the
ark
of
the
Josh6:13
And
seven
priests
bearing
seven
trumpets
of
horns
before
the
ark
of
the
LORD
went
on
and
blew
with
the
and
the
armed
men
went
before
but
the
rereward
came
after
the
ark
of
the
the
priests
going
and
blowing
wi
th
the
Josh6:14
And
the
second
day
they
compassed
the
city
and
returned
into
the
so
they
did
six
Josh6:15
And
it
came
to
pass
on
the
seventh
that
they
rose
early
about
the
dawning
of
the
and
compassed
the
city
after
th
e
same
manner
seven
only
on
that
day
they
compassed
the
city
seven
Josh6:16
And
it
came
to
pass
at
the
seventh
when
the
priests
blew
with
the
Joshua
said
unto
the
for
the
LORD
hath
given
you
the
Josh6:17
And
the
city
shall
be
even
and
all
that
are
to
the
only
Rahab
the
harlot
shall
she
and
all
that
are
with
her
in
the
because
she
hid
the
messengers
that
we
Josh6:18
And
in
any
wise
keep
yourselves
from
the
accursed
lest
ye
make
yourselves
when
ye
take
of
the
accurse
d
and
make
the
camp
of
Israel
a
and
trouble
Josh6:19
But
all
the
and
and
vessels
of
brass
and
are
consecrated
unto
the
they
shall
come
into
the
treas
ury
of
the
Josh6:20
So
the
people
shouted
when
the
priests
blew
with
the
and
it
came
to
when
the
people
heard
the
sound
of
the
and
the
people
shouted
with
a
great
that
the
wall
fell
down
so
that
the
people
went
up
into
the
every
man
straight
before
and
they
took
the
Josh6:21
And
they
utterly
destroyed
all
that
was
in
the
both
man
and
young
and
and
and
and
with
t
he
edge
of
the
Josh6:22
But
Joshua
had
said
unto
the
two
men
that
had
spied
out
the
Go
into
the
harlot's
and
bring
out
thence
the
and
all
that
she
as
ye
sware
unto
Josh6:23
And
the
young
men
that
were
spies
went
and
brought
out
Rahab,
and
her
and
her
and
her
and
al
l
that
she
and
they
brought
out
all
her
and
left
them
without
the
camp
of
Josh6:24
And
they
burnt
the
city
with
and
all
that
was
only
the
and
the
and
the
vessels
of
brass
and
o
f
they
put
into
the
treasury
of
the
house
of
the
Josh6:25
And
Joshua
saved
Rahab
the
harlot
and
her
father's
and
all
that
she
and
she
dwelleth
in
Israel
even
unto
this
because
she
hid
the
which
Joshua
sent
to
spy
out
Josh6:26
And
Joshua
adjured
them
at
that
Cursed
be
the
man
before
the
that
riseth
up
and
buildeth
this
city
Jer
icho:
he
shall
lay
the
foundation
thereof
in
his
and
in
his
youngest
son
shall
he
set
up
the
gates
of
Josh6:27
So
the
LORD
was
with
and
his
fame
was
noised
throughout
all
the
Josh7:1
But
the
children
of
Israel
committed
a
trespass
in
the
accursed
for
Achan,
the
son
of
Carmi,
the
son
of
Zabdi,
the
s
on
of
Zerah,
of
the
tribe
of
took
of
the
accursed
and
the
anger
of
the
LORD
was
kindled
against
the
children
of
Israe
l.
Josh7:2
And
Joshua
sent
men
from
Jericho
to
which
is
beside
Bethaven,
on
the
east
side
of
and
spake
unto
Go
up
and
view
the
And
the
men
went
up
and
viewed
Josh7:3
And
they
returned
to
and
said
unto
Let
not
all
the
people
go
but
let
about
two
or
three
thousand
men
go
up
and
smite
and
make
not
all
the
people
to
labour
for
they
are
but
Josh7:4
So
there
went
up
thither
of
the
people
about
three
thousand
and
they
fled
before
the
men
of
Josh7:5
And
the
men
of
Ai
smote
of
them
about
thirty
and
six
for
they
chased
them
from
before
the
gate
even
unto
Shebarim,
and
smote
them
in
the
going
wherefore
the
hearts
of
the
people
and
became
as
Josh7:6
And
Joshua
rent
his
and
fell
to
the
earth
upon
his
face
before
the
ark
of
the
LORD
until
the
he
and
the
elders
of
and
put
dust
upon
their
Josh7:7
And
Joshua
O
LORD
wherefore
hast
thou
at
all
brought
this
people
over
to
deliver
us
into
the
hand
of
the
Amorites,
to
destroy
would
to
God
we
had
been
and
dwelt
on
the
other
side
Josh7:8
O
what
shall
I
when
Israel
turneth
their
backs
before
their
Josh7:9
For
the
Canaanites
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
shall
hear
of

shall
environ
us
and
cut
off
our
name
f
rom
the
and
what
wilt
thou
do
unto
thy
great
Josh7:10
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Get
thee
wherefore
liest
thou
thus
upon
thy
Josh7:11
Israel
hath
and
they
have
also
transgressed
my
covenant
which
I
commanded
for
they
have
even
taken
of
the
ac
cursed
and
have
also
and
dissembled
and
they
have
put
it
even
among
their
own
Josh7:12
Therefore
the
children
of
Israel
could
not
stand
before
their
but
turned
their
backs
before
their
becaus
e
they
were
neither
will
I
be
with
you
any
except

destroy
the
accursed

sanctify
the
and
Sanctify
yourselves
against

for
thus
saith
the
LORD
God
of
There
is
a
n
accursed
thing
in
the
midst
of
O
thou
canst
not
stand
before
thine
until
ye
take
away
the
accursed
thing
f
rom
among
Josh7:14
In
the
morning
therefore
ye
shall
be
brought
according
to
your
and
it
shall
that
the
tribe
which
the
LORD
take
th
shall
come
according
to
the
families
and
the
family
which
the
LORD
shall
take

come
by

the
househo

which
the
LORD
shall

by
Josh7:15
And
it
shall
that
he
that
is
taken
with
the
accursed
thing
shall
be
burnt
with
he
and
all
that
he
because
he
hath
transgressed
the
covenant
of
the
and
because
he
hath
wrought
folly
in
Josh7:16
So
Joshua
rose
up
early
in
the
and
brought
Israel
by
their
and
the
tribe
of
Judah
was
Josh7:17
And
he
brought
the
family
of
and
he
took
the
family
of
the
Zarhites:
and
he
brought
the
family
of
the
Zarhites
man
by
and
Zabdi
was
Josh7:18
And
he
brought
his
household
man
by
and
Achan,
the
son
of
Carmi,
the
son
of
Zabdi,
the
son
of
Zerah,
of
the
tribe
of
was
Josh7:19
And
Joshua
said
unto
Achan,
My
I
pray
glory
to
the
LORD
God
of
and
make
confession
unto
and
tell
me
now
what
thou
hast
hide
it
not
from
Josh7:20
And
Achan
answered
and
Indeed
I
have
sinned
against
the
LORD
God
of
and
thus
and
thus
have
I
Josh7:21
When
I
saw
among
the
spoils
a
goodly
Babylonish
and
two
hundred
shekels
of
and
a
wedge
of
gold
of
fifty
s
hekels
then
I
coveted
and
took
they
are
hid
in
the
earth
in
the
midst
of
my
and
the
silver
u
nder
Josh7:22
So
Joshua
sent
and
they
ran
unto
the
it
was
hid
in
his
and
the
silver
under
Josh7:23
And
they
took
them
out
of
the
midst
of
the
and
brought
them
unto
and
unto
all
the
children
of
and
la
id
them
out
before
the
Josh7:24
And
and
all
Israel
with
took
Achan
the
son
of
Zerah,
and
the
and
the
and
the
wedge
of
and
his

his

his
and
his

his

his
and
all
that
he
and
they
brought
th
em
unto
the
valley
of
Achor.
Josh7:25
And
Joshua
Why
hast
thou
troubled
the
LORD
shall
trouble
thee
this
And
all
Israel
stoned
him
with
a
nd
burned
them
with
after
they
had
stoned
them
with
Josh7:26
And
they
raised
over
him
a
great
heap
of
stones
unto
this
So
the
LORD
turned
from
the
fierceness
of
his
Wheref
ore
the
name
of
that
place
was
The
valley
of
Achor,
unto
this
Josh8:1
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Fear

And
thou

ye
take

behind
Josh8:3
So
Joshua
and
all
the
people
of
to
go
up
against
and
Joshua
chose
out
thirty
thousand
mighty
men
of
and
sent
them
away
by
Josh8:4
And
he
commanded
ye

(For

They
flee

therefore
we

Josh8:7
Then
ye
shall
rise
up
from

And

Joshua
therefore
sent
them
and
they
went
to
lie
in
and
abode
between
Bethel
and
on
the
west
side
of
but
Joshua
lodged
that
night
among

And
Joshua
rose
up
early
in

and
numbered

went

and
the
elders

before
the
peo

to
Josh8:11
And
all
the
even
the
people
of

that
were
with
went

drew

came
before

and
pitch

on
the
north
side
of
now
there
was
a
valley
between
them
and
Josh8:12
And
he
took
about
five
thousand
and
set
them
to
lie
in
ambush
between
Bethel
and
on
the
west
side
of
the
Josh8:13
And
when
they
had
set
the
even
all
the
host
that
was
on

north
of

and
their
liers
in
wait
on
the
west
of
the
Joshua
went
that
night
into
the
midst
of
the
Josh8:14
And
it
came
to
when
the
king
of
Ai
saw
that
they
hasted
and
rose
up
and
the
men
of
the
city
went
out
agai

Israel
to
he
and
all
his
at
a
time
before
the
but
he
wist
not
that
there
were
liers
in
ambush
against
him
behind
the
Josh8:15
And
Joshua
and
all
Israel
made
as
if
they
were
beaten
before
and
fled
by
the
way
of
the
Josh8:16
And
all
the
people
that
were
in
Ai
were
called
together
to
pursue
after
and
they
pursued
after
and
were
draw
n
away
from
the
Josh8:17
And
there
was
not
a
man
left
in
Ai
or
that
went
not
out
after
and
they
left
the
city
and
pursued
aft

Josh8:18
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Stretch
out
the
spear
that
is
in
thy
hand
toward
for
I
will
give
it
into
thine
An
d
Joshua
stretched
out
the
spear
that
he
had
in
his
hand
toward
the
Josh8:19
And
the
ambush
arose
quickly
out
of
their
and
they
ran
as
soon
as
he
had
stretched
out
his
and
they
entered
i
nto
the
and
took
and
hasted
and
set
the
city
on
Josh8:20
And
when
the
men
of
Ai
looked
behind
they
the
smoke
of
the
city
ascended
up
to
and
they
ha
d
no
power
to
flee
this
way
or
that
and
the
people
that
fled
to
the
wilderness
turned
back
upon
the
Josh8:21
And
when
Joshua
and
all
Israel
saw
that
the
ambush
had
taken
the
and
that
the
smoke
of
the
city
then
they
turned
and
slew
the
men
of
Josh8:22
And
the
other
issued
out
of
the
city
against
so
they
were
in
the
midst
of
some
on
this
and
some
on
tha
t
and
they
smote
so
that
they
let
none
of
them
remain
or
Josh8:23
And
the
king
of
Ai
they
took
and
brought
him
to
Josh8:24
And
it
came
to
when
Israel
had
made
an
end
of
slaying
all
the
inhabitants
of
Ai
in
the
in
the
wilderness
wher
ein
they
chased
and
when
they
were
all
fallen
on
the
edge
of
the
until
they
were
that
all
the
Israelites
ret
urned
unto
and
smote
it
with
the
edge
of
the
Josh8:25
And
so
it
that
all
that
fell
that
both
of
men
and
were
twelve
even
all
the
men
of
Josh8:26
For
Joshua
drew
not
his
hand
wherewith
he
stretched
out
the
until
he
had
utterly
destroyed
all
the
inhabitant
s
of
Josh8:27
Only
the
cattle
and
the
spoil
of
that
city
Israel
took
for
a
prey
unto
according
unto
the
word
of
the
LORD
whi
ch
he
commanded
Josh8:28
And
Joshua
burnt
and
made
it
an
heap
for
even
a
desolation
unto
this
Josh8:29
And
the
king
of
Ai
he
hanged
on
a
tree
until
and
as
soon
as
the
sun
was
Joshua
commanded
that
they
should
take
his
carcase
down
from
the
and
cast
it
at
the
entering
of
the
gate
of
the
and
raise
thereon
a
great
heap
of
that
remaineth
unto
this
Josh8:30
Then
Joshua
built
an
altar
unto
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
in
mount
Ebal,
Josh8:31
As
Moses
the
servant
of
the
LORD
commanded
the
children
of
as
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
the
law
of
an
al
tar
of
whole
over
which
no
man
hath
lift
up
any
and
they
offered
thereon
burnt
offerings
unto
the
and
sacrifice
d
peace
Josh8:32
And
he
wrote
there
upon
the
stones
a
copy
of
the
law
of
which
he
wrote
in
the
presence
of
the
children
of
Josh8:33
And
all
and
their
and
and
their
stood
on
this
side
the
ark
and
on
that
side
before
the
p
riests
the
Levites,
which
bare
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
as
well
the
as
he
that
was
born
among
half
of
t
hem
over
against
mount
Gerizim,
and
half
of
them
over
against
mount
Ebal;
as
Moses
the
servant
of
the
LORD
had
commanded
th
at
they
should
bless
the
people
of
Josh8:34
And
afterward
he
read
all
the
words
of
the
the
blessings
and
cursings,
according
to
all
that
is
written
in
the
book
o
f
the
Josh8:35
There
was
not
a
word
of
all
that
Moses
which
Joshua
read
not
before
all
the
congregation
of
with
the
wo
and
the
little
and
the
strangers
that
were
conversant
among
Josh9:1
And
it
came
to
when
all
the
kings
which
were
on
this
side
in
the
and
in
the
and
in
all
the
co
asts
of
the
great
sea
over
against
the
and
the
Amorite,
the
the
Perizzite,
the
Hivite,
and
the
Jebusit
e,
heard
Josh9:2
That
they
gathered
themselves
to
fight
with
Joshua
and
with
with
one
Josh9:3
And
when
the
inhabitants
of
Gibeon
heard
what
Joshua
had
done
unto
Jericho
and
to
Josh9:4
They
did
work
and
went
and
made
as
if
they
had
been
and
took
old
sacks
upon
their
and
wine
bott
and
and
bound
Josh9:5
And
old
shoes
and
clouted
upon
their
and
old
garments
upon
and
all
the
bread
of
their
provision
was
dry
and
mou
ldy.
Josh9:6
And
they
went
to
Joshua
unto
the
camp
at
Gilgal,
and
said
unto
and
to
the
men
of
We
be
come
from
a
far
country
:
now
therefore
make
ye
a
league
with
Josh9:7
And
the
men
of
Israel
said
unto
the
Hivites,
Peradventure
ye
dwell
among
and
how
shall
we
make
a
league
with
Josh9:8
And
they
said
unto
We
are
thy
And
Joshua
said
unto
Who
are
and
from
whence
come
Josh9:9
And
they
said
unto
From
a
very
far
country
thy
servants
are
come
because
of
the
name
of
the
LORD
thy
for
we
have
heard
the
fame
of
and
all
that
he
did
in
Josh9:10
And
all
that
he
did
to
the
two
kings
of
the
Amorites,
that
were
beyond
to
Sihon
king
of
Heshbon,
and
to
Og
king
of
which
was
at
Ashtaroth.
Josh9:11
Wherefore
our
elders
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
our
country
spake
to
Take
victuals
with
you
for
the
a
nd
go
to
meet
and
say
unto
We
are
your
therefore
now
make
ye
a
league
with
Josh9:12
This
our
bread
we
took
hot
for
our
provision
out
of
our
houses
on
the
day
we
came
forth
to
go
unto
but
i
t
is
and
it
is
Josh9:13
And
these
bottles
of
which
we
were
they
be
and
these
our
garments
and
our
shoes
are
become
old
by
reason
of
the
very
long
Josh9:14
And
the
men
took
of
their
and
asked
not
counsel
at
the
mouth
of
the
Josh9:15
And
Joshua
made
peace
with
and
made
a
league
with
to
let
them
and
the
princes
of
the
congregation
sware
unto
Josh9:16
And
it
came
to
pass
at
the
end
of
three
days
after
they
had
made
a
league
with
that
they
heard
that
they
were
their
and
that
they
dwelt
among
Josh9:17
And
the
children
of
Israel
and
came
unto
their
cities
on
the
third
Now
their
cities
were
and
Cheph
irah,
and
Beeroth,
and
Kirjathjearim.
Josh9:18
And
the
children
of
Israel
smote
them
because
the
princes
of
the
congregation
had
sworn
unto
them
by
the
LORD
God
of
And
all
the
congregation
murmured
against
the
Josh9:19
But
all
the
princes
said
unto
all
the
We
have
sworn
unto
them
by
the
LORD
God
of
now
therefore
we
ma
y
not
touch
Josh9:20
This
we
will
do
to
we
will
even
let
them
lest
wrath
be
upon
because
of
the
oath
which
we
sware
unto
Josh9:21
And
the
princes
said
unto
Let
them
but
let
them
be
hewers
of
wood
and
drawers
of
water
unto
all
the
congregati
as
the
princes
had
promised
Josh9:22
And
Joshua
called
for
and
he
spake
unto
Wherefore
have
ye
beguiled
We
are
very
far
from
yo
u;
when
ye
dwell
among
Josh9:23
Now
therefore
ye
are
and
there
shall
none
of
you
be
freed
from
being
bondmen,
and
hewers
of
wood
and
drawers
of
wa
ter
for
the
house
of
my
Josh9:24
And
they
answered
and
Because
it
was
certainly
told
thy
how
that
the
LORD
thy
God
commanded
his
se
rvant
Moses
to
give
you
all
the
and
to
destroy
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
from
before
therefore
we
were
sore
afraid
of
our
lives
because
of
and
have
done
this
Josh9:25
And
we
are
in
thine
as
it
seemeth
good
and
right
unto
thee
to
do
unto
Josh9:26
And
so
did
he
unto
and
delivered
them
out
of
the
hand
of
the
children
of
that
they
slew
them
Josh9:27
And
Joshua
made
them
that
day
hewers
of
wood
and
drawers
of
water
for
the
and
for
the
altar
of
the
eve
n
unto
this
in
the
place
which
he
should
Josh10:1
Now
it
came
to
when
Adonizedec
king
of
Jerusalem
had
heard
how
Joshua
had
taken
and
had
utterly
destroyed
as
he
had
done
to
Jericho
and
her
so
he
had
done
to
Ai
and
her
and
how
the
inhabitants
of
Gibeon
had
made
peace
with
Isra
and
were
among
Josh10:2
That
they
feared
because
Gibeon
was
a
great
as
one
of
the
royal
and
because
it
was
greater
than
and
all
the
men
thereof
were
Josh10:3
Wherefore
Adonizedec
king
of
Jerusalem
sent
unto
Hoham
king
of
and
unto
Piram
king
of
Jarmuth,
and
unto
Japhia
kin
g
of
Lachish,
and
unto
Debir
king
of
Eglon,
Josh10:4
Come
up
unto
and
help
that
we
may
smite
for
it
hath
made
peace
with
Joshua
and
with
the
children
of
Israel
.
Josh10:5
Therefore
the
five
kings
of
the
Amorites,
the
king
of
the
king
of
the
king
of
Jarmuth,
the
king
of
Lach
ish,
the
king
of
Eglon,
gathered
themselves
and
went
they
and
all
their
and
encamped
before
and
made
w
ar
against
Josh10:6
And
the
men
of
Gibeon
sent
unto
Joshua
to
the
camp
to
Gilgal,
Slack
not
thy
hand
from
thy
come
up
to
us
and
save
and
help
for
all
the
kings
of
the
Amorites
that
dwell
in
the
mountains
are
gathered
together
against
Josh10:7
So
Joshua
ascended
from
Gilgal,
and
all
the
people
of
war
with
and
all
the
mighty
men
of
Josh10:8
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Fear
them
for
I
have
delivered
them
into
thine
there
shall
not
a
man
of
them
sta
nd
before
Josh10:9
Joshua
therefore
came
unto
them
and
went
up
from
Gilgal
all
Josh10:10
And
the
LORD
discomfited
them
before
and
slew
them
with
a
great
slaughter
at
and
chased
them
along
the
wa
y
that
goeth
up
to
Bethhoron,
and
smote
them
to
Azekah,
and
unto
Makkedah.
Josh10:11
And
it
came
to
as
they
fled
from
before
and
were
in
the
going
down
to
Bethhoron,
that
the
LORD
cast
down
gr
eat
stones
from
heaven
upon
them
unto
Azekah,
and
they
they
were
more
which
died
with
hailstones
than
they
whom
the
children
of
Israel
slew
with
the
Josh10:12
Then
spake
Joshua
to
the
LORD
in
the
day
when
the
LORD
delivered
up
the
Amorites
before
the
children
of
and
he
sa
id
in
the
sight
of
stand
thou
still
upon
and
in
the
valley
of
Ajalon.
Josh10:13
And
the
sun
stood
and
the
moon
until
the
people
had
avenged
themselves
upon
their
Is
not
this
wri
tten
in
the
book
of
Jasher?
So
the
sun
stood
still
in
the
midst
of
and
hasted
not
to
go
down
about
a
whole
Josh10:14
And
there
was
no
day
like
that
before
it
or
after
that
the
LORD
hearkened
unto
the
voice
of
a
for
the
LORD
fough
t
for
Josh10:15
And
Joshua
and
all
Israel
with
unto
the
camp
to
Gilgal.
Josh10:16
But
these
five
kings
and
hid
themselves
in
a
cave
at
Makkedah.
Josh10:17
And
it
was
told
The
five
kings
are
found
hid
in
a
cave
at
Makkedah.
Josh10:18
And
Joshua
Roll
great
stones
upon
the
mouth
of
the
and
set
men
by
it
for
to
keep
Josh10:19
And
stay
ye
but
pursue
after
your
and
smite
the
hindmost
of
suffer
them
not
to
enter
into
their
citie
s:
for
the
LORD
your
God
hath
delivered
them
into
your
Josh10:20
And
it
came
to
when
Joshua
and
the
children
of
Israel
had
made
an
end
of
slaying
them
with
a
very
great
till
they
were
that
the
rest
which
remained
of
them
entered
into
fenced
Josh10:21
And
all
the
people
returned
to
the
camp
to
Joshua
at
Makkedah
in
none
moved
his
tongue
against
any
of
the
children
of
Josh10:22
Then
said
Open
the
mouth
of
the
and
bring
out
those
five
kings
unto
me
out
of
the
Josh10:23
And
they
did
and
brought
forth
those
five
kings
unto
him
out
of
the
the
king
of
the
king
of
the
king
of
Jarmuth,
the
king
of
Lachish,
and
the
king
of
Eglon.
Josh10:24
And
it
came
to
when
they
brought
out
those
kings
unto
that
Joshua
called
for
all
the
men
of
and
sai
d
unto
the
captains
of
the
men
of
war
which
went
with
Come
put
your
feet
upon
the
necks
of
these
And
they
came
ne
and
put
their
feet
upon
the
necks
of
Josh10:25
And
Joshua
said
unto
Fear
nor
be
be
strong
and
of
good
for
thus
shall
the
LORD
do
to
all
yo
ur
enemies
against
whom
ye
Josh10:26
And
afterward
Joshua
smote
and
slew
and
hanged
them
on
five
and
they
were
hanging
upon
the
trees
until
the
Josh10:27
And
it
came
to
pass
at
the
time
of
the
going
down
of
the
that
Joshua
and
they
took
them
down
off
the
tree
s,
and
cast
them
into
the
cave
wherein
they
had
been
and
laid
great
stones
in
the
cave's
which
remain
until
this
very
d
ay.
Josh10:28
And
that
day
Joshua
took
Makkedah,
and
smote
it
with
the
edge
of
the
and
the
king
thereof
he
utterly
th
and
all
the
souls
that
were

let
none
and
he
did
to
the
king
of
Makkedah
as
he
did
unto
the
king
of
Josh10:29
Then
Joshua
passed
from
Makkedah,
and
all
Israel
with
unto
Libnah,
and
fought
against
Libnah:
Josh10:30
And
the
LORD
delivered
it
and
the
king
into
the
hand
of
and
he
smote
it
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
,
and
all
the
souls
that
were
he
let
none
remain
in
but
did
unto
the
king
thereof
as
he
did
unto
the
king
of
Josh10:31
And
Joshua
passed
from
Libnah,
and
all
Israel
with
unto
Lachish,
and
encamped
against
and
fought
against
Josh10:32
And
the
LORD
delivered
Lachish
into
the
hand
of
which
took
it
on
the
second
and
smote
it
with
the
edge
of
th

and
all
the
souls
that
were
according
to
all
that
he
had
done
to
Libnah.
Josh10:33
Then
Horam
king
of
Gezer
came
up
to
help
Lachish;
and
Joshua

Be

therefore
very
courageous
to

to
do
all
that

transgressed
the
covenant
of

kindled
against

perish
quickly
from

I
brought
you

For

will
we
also
s

And
Joshua
said
unto
the
Ye

And
the
people
said
unto

And
Joshua
said
unto
the
Ye

witnesses
against

Josh24:24
And
the
people
said
unto
The
LORD

Josh24:25
So
Joshua
made
a
covenant
with
the
people
that
and
set
them
a
statute
and
an
ordinance
in
Josh24:26
And
Joshua
wrote
these
words
in

book
of

took

set

So
Joshua
let
the
people
every
man

And
it
came
to
pass
after
these
that
Joshua

son
of
the
servant
of

hundred
and
t
en

Josh24:30
And
they
buried
him
in
the
border
of
his
inheritance
in
Timnathserah,
which
is
in

on
the
north
side
of
the
hill
of

Josh24:31
And
Israel
served
the
LORD
all
the
days
of

all
the
days
of
the
elders
that
overlived
and
which
had
kn

all
the
works
of
the
that
he
had
done
for
Josh24:32
And
the
bones
of
which
the
children
of
Israel
brought
up
out

they
in
in
a
parcel
of

they
buried
him

Jdgs1:1
Now
after
the
death
of
Joshua
it
came
to
that
the
children
of
Israel
asked
the
Who
shall
go
up
for
us

Canaanites
to
fight

And
the
LORD
Judah
shall

I
have
delivered
the
land
into
his
Jdgs1:3
And
Judah
said
unto
Simeon
his
Come

with
me
into
my

we
may
fight
against
the
Canaanites;
and
I
likewi

into

So
Simeon
went
with
Jdgs1:4
And
Judah
went
and
the
LORD
delivered
the
Canaanites
and
the
Perizzites
into
their

they
slew
of
them
in
Bezek
ten
thousand
Jdgs1:5
And
they
found
Adonibezek
in
Bezek:
and
they
fought
against

they
slew
the
Canaanites
and
the
Perizzites.
Jdgs1:6
But
Adonibezek
and
they
pursued

And
Adonibezek
Threescore

God
hath
requited
And
they
brought
him
to

there

Now
the
children
of
Judah
had
fought
against

had
taken

smitten
it
with
the
edge
of

the
city
on
Jdgs1:9
And
afterward
the
children
of
Judah
went
down
to
fight
against
the
Canaanites,
that
dwelt
in
the

in
the
south

and
in

And
Judah
went
against

Canaanites
that
dwelt

the
name
of
Hebron
before
was

and
they
slew
Sheshai,
and
Ahiman,
and

Jdgs1:11
And
from
thence
he
went
against
the
inhabitants
of
Debir:
and
the
name
of
Debir
before
was
Kirjathsepher:
Jdgs1:12
And
Caleb
He
that
smiteth
Kirjathsepher,
and
taketh

him
will
I
give
Achsah
my
daughter
to

And
Othniel
the
son
of
Kenaz,
Caleb's
younger
took

he
gave
him
Achsah
his
daughter
to
Jdgs1:14
And
it
came
to
when
she
came
to
that
she
moved
him
to
ask
of
her
father

she
lighted

and
Caleb
said
unto

And
the
children
of
the
Kenite,
father

up
out
of
the
city
of
palm
trees
with
the
children
of
Judah
int

the
wilderness
of
which
lieth
in
the
south
of
and
they
went
and
dwelt
among
the
Jdgs1:17
And
Judah
went
with
Simeon
his
and
they
slew
the
Canaanites
that
inhabited
Zephath,
and
utterly
destroyed
And
the
name
of
the
city
was
called
Hormah.
Jdgs1:18
Also
Judah
took
Gaza
with
the
coast
and
Askelon
with
the
coast
and
Ekron
with
the
coast
Jdgs1:19
And
the
LORD
was
with
and
he
drave
out
the
inhabitants
of
the
but
could
not
drive
out
the
inhabitants
of
the
because
they
had
chariots
of
Jdgs1:20
And
they
gave
Hebron
unto
as
Moses
and
he
expelled
thence
the
three
sons
of
Jdgs1:21
And
the
children
of
Benjamin
did
not
drive
out
the
Jebusites
that
inhabited
but
the
Jebusites
dwell
with
the
ch
ildren
of
Benjamin
in
Jerusalem
unto
this
Jdgs1:22
And
the
house
of
they
also
went
up
against
and
the
LORD
was
with
Jdgs1:23
And
the
house
of
Joseph
sent
to
descry
(Now
the
name
of
the
city
before
was
Luz.)
Jdgs1:24
And
the
spies
saw
a
man
come
forth
out
of
the
and
they
said
unto
Shew
we
pray
the
entrance
into
the
c

and
we
will
shew
thee
Jdgs1:25
And
when
he
shewed
them
the
entrance
into
the
they
smote
the
city
with
the
edge
of
the
but
they
let
go
the
ma

and
all
his
Jdgs1:26
And
the
man
went
into
the
land
of
the
Hittites,
and
built
a

called
the
name
thereof
Luz:
which
is
the
name
there
of
unto
this
Jdgs1:27
Neither
did
Manasseh
drive
out
the
inhabitants
of
Bethshean
and
her
nor
Taanach
and
her
nor
the
inhabitants
of
Dor
and
her
nor
the
inhabitants
of
Ibleam
and
her
nor
the
inhabitants
of
Megiddo
and
her
but
the
Canaanites
would
dwell
in
that
Jdgs1:28
And
it
came
to
when
Israel
was
that
they
put
the
Canaanites
to
and
did
not
utterly
drive
them
Jdgs1:29
Neither
did
Ephraim
drive
out
the
Canaanites
that
dwelt
in
Gezer;
but
the
Canaanites
dwelt
in
Gezer
among
Jdgs1:30
Neither
did
Zebulun
drive
out
the
inhabitants
of
Kitron,
nor
the
inhabitants
of
Nahalol;
but
the
Canaanites
dwelt
among
th
and
became
tributaries.
Jdgs1:31
Neither
did
Asher
drive
out
the
inhabitants
of
Accho,
nor
the
inhabitants
of
Zidon,
nor
of
Ahlab,
nor
of
Achzib,
nor
of
He
lbah,
nor
of
Aphik,
nor
of
Rehob:
Jdgs1:32
But
the
Asherites
dwelt
among
the
Canaanites,
the
inhabitants
of
the
for
they
did
not
drive
them
Jdgs1:33
Neither
did
Naphtali
drive
out
the
inhabitants
of
Bethshemesh,
nor
the
inhabitants
of
Bethanath;
but
he
dwelt
among
the
Ca
naanites,
the
inhabitants
of
the
nevertheless
the
inhabitants
of
Bethshemesh
and
of
Bethanath
became
tributaries
unto
Jdgs1:34
And
the
Amorites
forced
the
children
of
Dan
into
the
for
they
would
not
suffer
them
to
come
down
to
the
Jdgs1:35
But
the
Amorites
would
dwell
in
mount
Heres
in
Aijalon,
and
in
Shaalbim:
yet
the
hand
of
the
house
of
Joseph
so
that
they
became
tributaries.
Jdgs1:36
And
the
coast
of
the
Amorites
was
from
the
going
up
to
Akrabbim,
from
the
and
Jdgs2:1
And
an
angel
of
the
LORD
came
up
from
Gilgal
to
Bochim,
and
I
made
you
to
go
up
out
of
and
have
brought
you
un
to
the
land
which
I
sware
unto
your
and
I
I
will
never
break
my
covenant
with
Jdgs2:2
And
ye
shall
make
no
league
with
the
inhabitants
of
this
ye
shall
throw
down
their
but
ye
have
not
obeyed
my
why
have
ye
done
Jdgs2:3
Wherefore
I
also
I
will
not
drive
them
out
from
before
but
they
shall
be
as
thorns
in
your
and
their
gods
shall
be
a
snare
unto
Jdgs2:4
And
it
came
to
when
the
angel
of
the
LORD
spake
these
words
unto
all
the
children
of
that
the
people
lifted
u
p
their
and
Jdgs2:5
And
they
called
the
name
of
that
place
Bochim:
and
they
sacrificed
there
unto
the
Jdgs2:6
And
when
Joshua
had
let
the
people
the
children
of
Israel
went
every
man
unto
his
inheritance
to
possess
the
Jdgs2:7
And
the
people
served
the
LORD
all
the
days
of
and
all
the
days
of
the
elders
that
outlived
who
had
seen
al
l
the
great
works
of
the
that
he
did
for
Jdgs2:8
And
Joshua
the
son
of
the
servant
of
the
being
an
hundred
and
ten
years
Jdgs2:9
And
they
buried
him
in
the
border
of
his
inheritance
in
Timnathheres,
in
the
mount
of
on
the
north
side
of
the
hil
l
Gaash.
Jdgs2:10
And
also
all
that
generation
were
gathered
unto
their
and
there
arose
another
generation
after
which
knew
n
ot
the
nor
yet
the
works
which
he
had
done
for
Jdgs2:11
And
the
children
of
Israel
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
and
served
Baalim:
Jdgs2:12
And
they
forsook
the
LORD
God
of
their
which
brought
them
out
of
the
land
of
and
followed
other
of
t
he
gods
of
the
people
that
were
round
about
and
bowed
themselves
unto
and
provoked
the
LORD
to
Jdgs2:13
And
they
forsook
the
and
served
Baal
and
Ashtaroth.
Jdgs2:14
And
the
anger
of
the
LORD
was
hot
against
and
he
delivered
them
into
the
hands
of
spoilers
that
spoiled
and
he
sold
them
into
the
hands
of
their
enemies
round
so
that
they
could
not
any
longer
stand
before
their
Jdgs2:15
Whithersoever
they
went
the
hand
of
the
LORD
was
against
them
for
as
the
LORD
had
and
as
the
LORD
had
swo
rn
unto
and
they
were
greatly
Jdgs2:16
Nevertheless
the
LORD
raised
up
which
delivered
them
out
of
the
hand
of
those
that
spoiled
Jdgs2:17
And
yet
they
would
not
hearken
unto
their
but
they
went
a
whoring
after
other
and
bowed
themselves
unto
them
:
they
turned
quickly
out
of
the
way
which
their
fathers
walked
obeying
the
commandments
of
the
but
they
did
not
Jdgs2:18
And
when
the
LORD
raised
them
up
then
the
LORD
was
with
the
and
delivered
them
out
of
the
hand
of
their
ene
mies
all
the
days
of
the
for
it
repented
the
LORD
because
of
their
groanings
by
reason
of
them
that
oppressed
them
and
vexed
Jdgs2:19
And
it
came
to
when
the
judge
was
that
they
and
corrupted
themselves
more
than
their
in
fol
lowing
other
gods
to
serve
and
to
bow
down
unto
they
ceased
not
from
their
own
nor
from
their
stubborn
Jdgs2:20
And
the
anger
of
the
LORD
was
hot
against
and
he
Because
that
this
people
hath
transgressed
my
covenant
whic
h
I
commanded
their
and
have
not
hearkened
unto
my
Jdgs2:21
I
also
will
not
henceforth
drive
out
any
from
before
them
of
the
nations
which
Joshua
left
when
he
Jdgs2:22
That
through
them
I
may
prove
whether
they
will
keep
the
way
of
the
LORD
to
walk
as
their
fathers
did
kee
p
or
Jdgs2:23
Therefore
the
LORD
left
those
without
driving
them
out
neither
delivered
he
them
into
the
hand
of
Joshua
.
Jdgs3:1
Now
these
are
the
nations
which
the
LORD
to
prove
Israel
by
even
as
many
of
Israel
as
had
not
known
all
the
war
s
of
Jdgs3:2
Only
that
the
generations
of
the
children
of
Israel
might
to
teach
them
at
the
least
such
as
before
knew
nothing
Jdgs3:3
five
lords
of
the
and
all
the
Canaanites,
and
the
Sidonians,
and
the
Hivites
that
dwelt
in
mount
Leban
from
mount
Baalhermon
unto
the
entering
in
of
Hamath.
Jdgs3:4
And
they
were
to
prove
Israel
by
to
know
whether
they
would
hearken
unto
the
commandments
of
the
which
he
comma
nded
their
fathers
by
the
hand
of
Jdgs3:5
And
the
children
of
Israel
dwelt
among
the
Canaanites,
Hittites,
and
Amorites,
and
Perizzites,
and
Hivites,
and
Jebusites:
Jdgs3:6
And
they
took
their
daughters
to
be
their
and
gave
their
daughters
to
their
and
served
their
Jdgs3:7
And
the
children
of
Israel
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
and
forgat
the
LORD
their
and
served
Baalim
and
the
grov
es.
Jdgs3:8
Therefore
the
anger
of
the
LORD
was
hot
against
and
he
sold
them
into
the
hand
of
Chushanrishathaim
king
of
Mesopot
amia:
and
the
children
of
Israel
served
Chushanrishathaim
eight
Jdgs3:9
And
when
the
children
of
Israel
cried
unto
the
the
LORD
raised
up
a
deliverer
to
the
children
of
who
delivere
d
even
Othniel
the
son
of
Kenaz,
Caleb's
younger
Jdgs3:10
And
the
Spirit
of
the
LORD
came
upon
and
he
judged
and
went
out
to
and
the
LORD
delivered
Chushanrishath
aim
king
of
Mesopotamia
into
his
and
his
hand
prevailed
against
Chushanrishathaim.
Jdgs3:11
And
the
land
had
rest
forty
And
Othniel
the
son
of
Kenaz
Jdgs3:12
And
the
children
of
Israel
did
evil
again
in
the
sight
of
the
and
the
LORD
strengthened
Eglon
the
king
of
Moab
again
st
because
they
had
done
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
Jdgs3:13
And
he
gathered
unto
him
the
children
of
Ammon
and
Amalek,
and
went
and
smote
and
possessed
the
city
of
palm
trees
.
Jdgs3:14
So
the
children
of
Israel
served
Eglon
the
king
of
Moab
eighteen
Jdgs3:15
But
when
the
children
of
Israel
cried
unto
the
the
LORD
raised
them
up
a
Ehud
the
son
of
a
Benjamit
e,
a
man
and
by
him
the
children
of
Israel
sent
a
present
unto
Eglon
the
king
of
Jdgs3:16
But
Ehud
made
him
a
dagger
which
had
two
of
a
cubit
and
he
did
gird
it
under
his
raiment
upon
his
right
thi
gh.
Jdgs3:17
And
he
brought
the
present
unto
Eglon
king
of

And
Ehud

And
Ehud

he
arose
out

And
Ehud
put
forth

took
the
dagger
from

thrust
it
into

And
the

that
he
could
not

Ehud
went

Jdgs3:27
And
it
came
to
when
he
was

he
blew
a
trumpet
in

mountain
of

the
children
of
Israel
went
down
with
him
from

slew
of

Philistines
six
hundred
men
with
an

And
the
children
of
Israel
again
did
evil
in
the
sight
of

when
Ehud
was

And
the
LORD
sold
them

And
she
sent

called
Barak
the

said
unto

I
will
deliver
him

Barak
said

I

but
if

I
will

And
she
I
will

Deborah

went
with
Barak
to
Kedesh.
Jdgs4:10
And
Barak
called
Zebulun
and
Naphtali
to
Kedesh;
and
he
went
up
with
ten
thousand
men
at
his
and
Deborah
went
up
wit

Jdgs4:11
Now
Heber
the
Kenite,
which
was
of
the
children
of
Hobab
the
father
in

of

severed
himself
from
the
Kenites,
and
pitched
his
tent
unto
the
plain
of
Zaanaim,
which
is
by
Kedesh.
Jdgs4:12
And
they
shewed
Sisera
that
Barak
the
son
of
Abinoam
was
gone
up
to
mount
Jdgs4:13
And
Sisera
gathered
together
all

all
the
people
that
were
with
from
Harosheth
of
the
Gentiles
unto

Jdgs4:14
And
Deborah
said
unto
Barak,

is

So
Barak
went
down
from
mount
and
ten
thousand
men
after
Jdgs4:15
And
the
LORD
discomfited
and
all
his
and
all
his
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
before
Barak;
so
that
Sisera
lighted
down
off
his
and
fled
away
on
his
Jdgs4:16
But
Barak
pursued
after
the
and
after
the
unto
Harosheth
of
the
and
all
the
host
of
Sisera
fell
upon
the
edge
of
the
and
there
was
not
a
man
Jdgs4:17
Howbeit
Sisera
fled
away
on
his
feet
to
the
tent
of
Jael
the
wife
of
Heber
the
Kenite:
for
there
was
peace
between
Jabin
t

king
of
Hazor
and
the
house
of
Heber
the
Kenite.
Jdgs4:18
And
Jael
went
out
to
meet
and
said
unto
Turn
my
turn
in
to
fear
And
when
he
had
turned
in
unto
her
into
the
she
covered
him
with
a

he
said
unto

she
opened
a
bottle
of

Again
he
said
unto

Then
Jael
Heber's
wife
took
a
nail
of
the
and
took
an
hammer
in
her
and
went
softly
unto

smote
the

fastened
it
into

he
was
fast
asleep
and
So
he
Jdgs4:22
as
Barak
pursued
Jael
came
out
to
meet
and
said
unto

I
will
shew
thee
the
man
who

thou
seekest.
And
when
he
came
into
her
Sisera
lay
and
the
nail
was
in
his
Jdgs4:23
So
God
subdued
on
that

king
of
Canaan
before

And

prevailed
against

unto
the
LORD
thy
God
upon
the
top
of
this
in
the
ordered
and
take
the
second
and
offer
a
burnt
sacrifice
with
the
wood
of
the
grove
which
thou
shalt
cut
Jdgs6:27
Then
Gideon
took
ten
men
of
his
and
did
as
the
LORD
had
said
unto
and
so
it
because
he
feared
his
fath
er's
and
the
men
of
the
that
he
could
not
do
it
by
that
he
did
it
by
Jdgs6:28
And
when
the
men
of
the
city
arose
early
in
the
the
altar
of
Baal
was
cast
and
the
grove
was
cut
do
wn
that
was
by
and
the
second
bullock
was
offered
upon
the
altar
that
was
Jdgs6:29
And
they
said
one
to
Who
hath
done
this
And
when
they
enquired
and
they
Gideon
the
son
of
Joa
sh
hath
done
this
Jdgs6:30
Then
the
men
of
the
city
said
unto
Joash,
Bring
out
thy
that
he
may
because
he
hath
cast
down
the
altar
of
and
because
he
hath
cut
down
the
grove
that
was
by
Jdgs6:31
And
Joash
said
unto
all
that
stood
against
Will
ye
plead
for
will
ye
save
he
that
will
plead
for
let
him
be
put
to
death
whilst
it
is
yet
if
he
be
a
let
him
plead
for
because
one
hath
cast
down
his
Jdgs6:32
Therefore
on
that
day
he
called
him
Jerubbaal,
Let
Baal
plead
against
because
he
hath
thrown
down
his
Jdgs6:33
Then
all
the
Midianites
and
the
Amalekites
and
the
children
of
the
east
were
gathered
and
went
and
pitched
in
the
valley
of
Jdgs6:34
But
the
Spirit
of
the
LORD
came
upon
and
he
blew
a
and
Abiezer
was
gathered
after
Jdgs6:35
And
he
sent
messengers
throughout
all
who
also
was
gathered
after
and
he
sent
messengers
unto
and
un
to
and
unto
and
they
came
up
to
meet
Jdgs6:36
And
Gideon
said
unto
If
thou
wilt
save
Israel
by
mine
as
thou
hast
Jdgs6:37
I
will
put
a
fleece
of
wool
in
the
and
if
the
dew
be
on
the
fleece
and
it
be
dry
upon
all
the
earth
b
eside,
then
shall
I
know
that
thou
wilt
save
Israel
by
mine
as
thou
hast
Jdgs6:38
And
it
was
for
he
rose
up
early
on
the
and
thrust
the
fleece
and
wringed
the
dew
out
of
the
a
bowl
full
of
Jdgs6:39
And
Gideon
said
unto
Let
not
thine
anger
be
hot
against
and
I
will
speak
but
this
let
me
I
pray
thee
,
but
this
once
with
the
let
it
now
be
dry
only
upon
the
and
upon
all
the
ground
let
there
be
Jdgs6:40
And
God
did
so
that
for
it
was
dry
upon
the
fleece
and
there
was
dew
on
all
the
Jdgs7:1
Then
Jerubbaal,
who
is
and
all
the
people
that
were
with
rose
up
and
pitched
beside
the
well
of
Harod:
so
that
the
host
of
the
Midianites
were
on
the
north
side
of
by
the
hill
of
Moreh,
in
the
Jdgs7:2
And
the
LORD
said
unto
The
people
that
are
with
thee
are
too
many
for
me
to
give
the
Midianites
into
their
l
est
Israel
vaunt
themselves
against
Mine
own
hand
hath
saved
Jdgs7:3
Now
therefore
go
proclaim
in
the
ears
of
the
Whosoever
is
fearful
and
let
him
return
and
depart
early
from
mount
And
there
returned
of
the
people
twenty
and
two
and
there
remained
ten
Jdgs7:4
And
the
LORD
said
unto
The
people
are
yet
too
bring
them
down
unto
the
and
I
will
try
them
for
thee
th
and
it
shall
that
of
whom
I
say
unto
This
shall
go
with
the
same
shall
go
with
and
of
whomsoever
I
say
u
nto
This
shall
not
go
with
the
same
shall
not
Jdgs7:5
So
he
brought
down
the
people
unto
the
and
the
LORD
said
unto
Every
one
that
lappeth
of
the
water
with
his
t
ongue,
as
a
dog
lappeth,
him
shalt
thou
set
by
likewise
every
one
that
boweth
down
upon
his
knees
to
Jdgs7:6
And
the
number
of
them
that
putting
their
hand
to
their
were
three
hundred
but
all
the
rest
of
the
peop
le
bowed
down
upon
their
knees
to
drink
Jdgs7:7
And
the
LORD
said
unto
By
the
three
hundred
men
that
lapped
will
I
save
and
deliver
the
Midianites
into
thine
and
let
all
the
other
people
go
every
man
unto
his
Jdgs7:8
So
the
people
took
victuals
in
their
and
their
and
he
sent
all
the
rest
of
Israel
every
man
unto
his
and
retained
those
three
hundred
and
the
host
of
Midian
was
beneath
him
in
the
Jdgs7:9
And
it
came
to
pass
the
same
that
the
LORD
said
unto
get
thee
down
unto
the
for
I
have
delivered
i
t
into
thine
Jdgs7:10
But
if
thou
fear
to
go
go
thou
with
Phurah
thy
servant
down
to
the
Jdgs7:11
And
thou
shalt
hear
what
they
and
afterward
shall
thine
hands
be
strengthened
to
go
down
unto
the
Then
went
he
down
with
Phurah
his
servant
unto
the
outside
of
the
armed
men
that
were
in
the
Jdgs7:12
And
the
Midianites
and
the
Amalekites
and
all
the
children
of
the
east
lay
along
in
the
valley
like
grasshoppers
for
multi
tude;
and
their
camels
were
without
as
the
sand
by
the
sea
side
for
Jdgs7:13
And
when
Gideon
was
there
was
a
man
that
told
a
dream
unto
his
and
I
dreamed
a
a
cake
of
barley
bread
tumbled
into
the
host
of
and
came
unto
a
and
smote
it
that
it
and
overturned
it
,
that
the
tent
lay
Jdgs7:14
And
his
fellow
answered
and
This
is
nothing
else
save
the
sword
of
Gideon
the
son
of
Joash,
a
man
of
for
int
o
his
hand
hath
God
delivered
and
all
the
Jdgs7:15
And
it
was
when
Gideon
heard
the
telling
of
the
and
the
interpretation
that
he
and
returne
d
into
the
host
of
and
for
the
LORD
hath
delivered
into
your
hand
the
host
of
Jdgs7:16
And
he
divided
the
three
hundred
men
into
three
and
he
put
a
trumpet
in
every
man's
with
empty
and
lamps
within
the
Jdgs7:17
And
he
said
unto
Look
on
and
do
when
I
come
to
the
outside
of
the
it
shall
be
as
I
so
shall
ye
Jdgs7:18
When
I
blow
with
a
I
and
all
that
are
with
then
blow
ye
the
trumpets
also
on
every
side
of
all
the
and
The
sword
of
the
and
of
Jdgs7:19
So
and
the
hundred
men
that
were
with
came
unto
the
outside
of
the
camp
in
the
beginning
of
the
middle
and
they
had
but
newly
set
the
and
they
blew
the
and
brake
the
pitchers
that
were
in
their
Jdgs7:20
And
the
three
companies
blew
the
and
brake
the
and
held
the
lamps
in
their
left
and
the
trumpet
s
in
their
right
hands
to
blow
and
they
The
sword
of
the
and
of
Jdgs7:21
And
they
stood
every
man
in
his
place
round
about
the
and
all
the
host
and
and
Jdgs7:22
And
the
three
hundred
blew
the
and
the
LORD
set
every
man's
sword
against
his
even
throughout
all
the
ho
and
the
host
fled
to
Bethshittah
in
Zererath,
and
to
the
border
of
Abelmeholah,
unto
Tabbath.
Jdgs7:23
And
the
men
of
Israel
gathered
themselves
together
out
of
and
out
of
and
out
of
all
and
pursued
after
the
Midianites.
Jdgs7:24
And
Gideon
sent
messengers
throughout
all
mount
Come
down
against
the
Midianites,
and
take
before
them
th
e
waters
unto
Bethbarah
and
Then
all
the
men
of
Ephraim
gathered
themselves
and
took
the
waters
unto
Bethbarah
an
d
Jdgs7:25
And
they
took
two
princes
of
the
Midianites,
Oreb
and
Zeeb;
and
they
slew
Oreb
upon
the
rock
Oreb,
and
Zeeb
they
slew
at
t
he
winepress
of
Zeeb,
and
pursued
and
brought
the
heads
of
Oreb
and
Zeeb
to
Gideon
on
the
other
side
Jdgs8:1
And
the
men
of
Ephraim
said
unto
Why
hast
thou
served
us
that
thou
calledst
us
when
thou
wentest
to
fight
w
ith
the
Midianites?
And
they
did
chide
with
him
Jdgs8:2
And
he
said
unto
What
have
I
done
now
in
comparison
of
Is
not
the
gleaning
of
the
grapes
of
Ephraim
better
than
the
vintage
of
Abiezer?
Jdgs8:3
God
hath
delivered
into
your
hands
the
princes
of
Oreb
and
Zeeb:
and
what
was
I
able
to
do
in
comparison
of
Th
en
their
anger
was
abated
toward
when
he
had
said
Jdgs8:4
And
Gideon
came
to
and
passed
and
the
three
hundred
men
that
were
with
yet
pursuing
Jdgs8:5
And
he
said
unto
the
men
of
I
pray
loaves
of
bread
unto
the
people
that
follow
for
they
be
a
nd
I
am
pursuing
after
Zebah
and
Zalmunna,
kings
of
Jdgs8:6
And
the
princes
of
Succoth
Are
the
hands
of
Zebah
and
Zalmunna
now
in
thine
that
we
should
give
bread
unto
thin
e
Jdgs8:7
And
Gideon
Therefore
when
the
LORD
hath
delivered
Zebah
and
Zalmunna
into
mine
then
I
will
tear
your
flesh
with
the
thorns
of
the
wilderness
and
with
briers.
Jdgs8:8
And
he
went
up
thence
to
Penuel,
and
spake
unto
them
and
the
men
of
Penuel
answered
him
as
the
men
of
Succoth
had
answered
Jdgs8:9
And
he
spake
also
unto
the
men
of
Penuel,
When
I
come
again
in
I
will
break
down
this
Jdgs8:10
Now
Zebah
and
Zalmunna
were
in
Karkor,
and
their
hosts
with
about
fifteen
thousand
all
that
were
left
of
all
th
e
hosts
of
the
children
of
the
for
there
fell
an
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
men
that
drew
Jdgs8:11
And
Gideon
went
up
by
the
way
of
them
that
dwelt
in
tents
on
the
east
of
Nobah
and
Jogbehah,
and
smote
the
for
the
h
ost
was
Jdgs8:12
And
when
Zebah
and
Zalmunna
he
pursued
after
and
took
the
two
kings
of
Zebah
and
Zalmunna,
and
discomf
ited
all
the
Jdgs8:13
And
Gideon
the
son
of
Joash
returned
from
battle
before
the
sun
was
Jdgs8:14
And
caught
a
young
man
of
the
men
of
and
enquired
of
and
he
described
unto
him
the
princes
of
and
t
he
elders
even
threescore
and
seventeen
Jdgs8:15
And
he
came
unto
the
men
of
and
Behold
Zebah
and
Zalmunna,
with
whom
ye
did
upbraid
Are
the
han
ds
of
Zebah
and
Zalmunna
now
in
thine
that
we
should
give
bread
unto
thy
men
that
are
Jdgs8:16
And
he
took
the
elders
of
the
and
thorns
of
the
wilderness
and
briers,
and
with
them
he
taught
the
men
of
Jdgs8:17
And
he
beat
down
the
tower
of
Penuel,
and
slew
the
men
of
the
Jdgs8:18
Then
said
he
unto
Zebah
and
Zalmunna,
What
manner
of
men
were
they
whom
ye
slew
at
And
they
As
thou
so
were
each
one
resembled
the
children
of
a
Jdgs8:19
And
he
They
were
my
even
the
sons
of
my
as
the
LORD
if
ye
had
saved
them
I
would
no
t
slay
Jdgs8:20
And
he
said
unto
Jether
his
and
slay
But
the
youth
drew
not
his
for
he
because
he
was
yet
a
Jdgs8:21
Then
Zebah
and
Zalmunna
Rise
and
fall
upon
for
as
the
man
so
is
his
And
Gideon
and
sl
ew
Zebah
and
Zalmunna,
and
took
away
the
ornaments
that
were
on
their
Jdgs8:22
Then
the
men
of
Israel
said
unto
Rule
thou
over
both
and
thy
and
thy
son's
son
for
thou
hast
delivered
us
from
the
hand
of
Jdgs8:23
And
Gideon
said
unto
I
will
not
rule
over
neither
shall
my
son
rule
over
the
LORD
shall
rule
over
Jdgs8:24
And
Gideon
said
unto
I
would
desire
a
request
of
that
ye
would
give
me
every
man
the
earrings
of
his
(For
they
had
golden
because
they
were
Ishmaelites.)
Jdgs8:25
And
they
We
will
willingly
give
And
they
spread
a
and
did
cast
therein
every
man
the
earrings
of
his
Jdgs8:26
And
the
weight
of
the
golden
earrings
that
he
requested
was
a
thousand
and
seven
hundred
shekels
of
beside
ornaments
,
and
and
purple
raiment
that
was
on
the
kings
of
and
beside
the
chains
that
were
about
their
Jdgs8:27
And
Gideon
made
an
ephod
and
put
it
in
his
even
in
Ophrah:
and
all
Israel
went
thither
a
whoring
after
which
thing
became
a
snare
unto
and
to
his
Jdgs8:28
Thus
was
Midian
subdued
before
the
children
of
so
that
they
lifted
up
their
heads
no
And
the
country
was
in
quietness
forty
years
in
the
days
of
Jdgs8:29
And
Jerubbaal
the
son
of
Joash
went
and
dwelt
in
his
own
Jdgs8:30
And
Gideon
had
threescore
and
ten
sons
of
his
body
for
he
had
many
Jdgs8:31
And
his
concubine
that
was
in
she
also
bare
him
a
whose
name
he
called
Abimelech.
Jdgs8:32
And
Gideon
the
son
of
Joash
died
in
a
good
old
and
was
buried
in
the
sepulchre
of
Joash
his
in
Ophrah
of
the
Abiezrites.
Jdgs8:33
And
it
came
to
as
soon
as
Gideon
was
that
the
children
of
Israel
turned
and
went
a
whoring
after
Baalim
,
and
made
Baalberith
their
Jdgs8:34
And
the
children
of
Israel
remembered
not
the
LORD
their
who
had
delivered
them
out
of
the
hands
of
all
their
enemies
on
every
Jdgs8:35
Neither
shewed
they
kindness
to
the
house
of
Jerubbaal,
according
to
all
the
goodness
which
he
had
shewed
unto
Jdgs9:1
And
Abimelech
the
son
of
Jerubbaal
went
to
Shechem
unto
his
mother's
and
communed
with
and
with
all
the
fam
ily
of
the
house
of
his
mother's
Jdgs9:2
I
pray
in
the
ears
of
all
the
men
of
Whether
is
better
for
either
that
all
the
sons
of
Jerubbaal,
which
are
threescore
and
ten
reign
over
or
that
one
reign
over
remember
also
that
I
am
your
bone
and
your
flesh
.
Jdgs9:3
And
his
mother's
brethren
spake
of
him
in
the
ears
of
all
the
men
of
Shechem
all
these
and
their
hearts
inclined
to
follow
Abimelech;
for
they
He
is
our
Jdgs9:4
And
they
gave
him
threescore
and
ten
pieces
of
silver
out
of
the
house
of
Baalberith,
wherewith
Abimelech
hired
vain
and
li
ght
which
followed
Jdgs9:5
And
he
went
unto
his
father's
house
at
Ophrah,
and
slew
his
brethren
the
sons
of
Jerubbaal,
being
threescore
and
ten
person
s,
upon
one
notwithstanding
yet
Jotham
the
youngest
son
of
Jerubbaal
was
for
he
hid
Jdgs9:6
And
all
the
men
of
Shechem
gathered
and
all
the
house
of
Millo,
and
and
made
Abimelech
by
the
plain
o
f
the
pillar
that
was
in
Jdgs9:7
And
when
they
told
it
to
Jotham,
he
went
and
stood
in
the
top
of
mount
Gerizim,
and
lifted
up
his
and
and
sai
d
unto
Hearken
unto
ye
men
of
that
God
may
hearken
unto
Jdgs9:8
The
trees
went
forth
on
a
time
to
anoint
a
king
over
and
they
said
unto
the
olive
Reign

Now
if

have
made
Abimelech
and
if
ye
have
dealt
well
with
Je

unto

according
to
the
deserving
of

Jdgs9:17
(For
my
father
fought
for
and
adventured
his
life
and
delivered
you
out
of
the
hand
of
Jdgs9:18
And
ye

up
against

and

threescore
and
ten
upon

have
made
Abimelech,
the
son
of
his
king
over
the
men
of
because
he
is
your
brother;)
Jdgs9:19
If
ye
then
have
dealt
truly
and
sincerely
with
Jerubbaal
and
with
his
house
this
then
rejoice
ye
in
Abimelech,

And
Jotham
ran

dwelt
for
fear
of
Abimelech
his
Jdgs9:22
When
Abimelech
had
reigned
three
years
over
Jdgs9:23
Then
God
sent
an
evil
spirit
between
Abimelech
and
the
men
of
and
the
men
of
Shechem
dealt
treacherously
with
Abi
melech:
Jdgs9:24
That
the
cruelty
done
to
the
threescore
and
ten
sons
of
Jerubbaal
might
and
their
blood
be
laid
upon
Abimelech
their
which
slew
and
upon
the
men
of
which
aided
him
in
the
killing
of
his
Jdgs9:25
And
the
men
of
Shechem
set
liers
in
wait
for
him
in
the
top
of
the
and
they
robbed
all
that
came
along
that
way
by
and
it
was
told
Abimelech.
Jdgs9:26
And
Gaal
the
son
of
Ebed
came
with
his
and
went
over
to
and
the
men
of
Shechem
put
their
confidence
in
Jdgs9:27
And
they
went
out
into
the
and
gathered
their
and
trode

made
and
went
into
the
h
ouse
of
their
and
did
eat
and
and
cursed
Abimelech.
Jdgs9:28
And
Gaal
the
son
of
Ebed
Who
is
Abimelech,
and
who
is
that
we
should
serve
is
not

the
son
of
Jerubb

and
Zebul
his
serve
the
men
of
Hamor
the
father
of
for
why
should
we
serve
Jdgs9:29
And
would
to
God
this
people
were
under
my
then
would
I
remove
Abimelech.
And
he
said
to
Abimelech,
Increase
thine
a
rmy,
and
come
Jdgs9:30
And
when
Zebul
the
ruler
of
the
city
heard
the
words
of
Gaal
the
son
of
Ebed,
his
anger
was
Jdgs9:31
And
he
sent
messengers
unto
Abimelech
Gaal
the
son
of
Ebed
and
his
brethren
be
come
to
a
they
fortify
the
city
against

Now
therefore
up
by
thou
and
the
people
that
is
with
and
lie
in
wait
in
the
Jdgs9:33
And
it
shall
that
in

as
soon
as
the
sun
is
thou
shalt
rise
and
set
upon
the
when

and
the
people
that
is
with
him
come
out
against
then
mayest
thou
do
to
them
as
thou
shalt
find
Jdgs9:34
And
Abimelech
rose
and
all
the
people
that
were
with
by
and
they
laid
wait
against
Shechem
in
four
compani
es.
Jdgs9:35
And
Gaal
the
son
of
Ebed
went
and
stood
in
the
entering
of
the
gate
of
the
and
Abimelech
rose
and
the
peopl
e
that
were
with
from
lying
in
Jdgs9:36
And
when
Gaal
saw
the
he
said
to
Zebul,
there
come
people
down
from
the
top
of
the
And
Zebul
sa
id
unto
Thou
seest
the
shadow
of
the
mountains
as
if
they
were
Jdgs9:37
And
Gaal
spake
again
and
See
there
come
people
down
by
the
middle
of
the
and
another
company
come
along
by
the
plain
of
Meonenim.
Jdgs9:38
Then
said
Zebul
unto
Where
is
now
thy
wherewith
thou
saidst,
Who
is
Abimelech,
that
we
should
serve
is
no
t
this
the
people
that
thou
hast
go
I
pray
and
fight
with
Jdgs9:39
And
Gaal
went
out
before
the
men
of
and
fought
with
Abimelech.
Jdgs9:40
And
Abimelech
chased
and
he
fled
before
and
many
were
overthrown
and
even
unto
the
entering
of
the
gate
.
Jdgs9:41
And
Abimelech
dwelt
at
Arumah:
and
Zebul
thrust
out
Gaal
and
his
that
they
should
not
dwell
in
Jdgs9:42
And
it
came
to
pass
on
the
that
the
people
went
out
into
the
and
they
told
Abimelech.
Jdgs9:43
And
he
took
the
and
divided
them
into
three
and
laid
wait
in
the
and
the
pe
ople
were
come
forth
out
of
the
and
he
rose
up
against
and
smote
Jdgs9:44
And
Abimelech,
and
the
company
that
was
with
rushed
and
stood
in
the
entering
of
the
gate
of
the
and
t
he
two
other
companies
ran
upon
all
the
people
that
were
in
the
and
slew
Jdgs9:45
And
Abimelech
fought
against
the
city
all
that
and
he
took
the
and
slew
the
people
that
was
and
beat
d
own
the
and
sowed
it
with
Jdgs9:46
And
when
all
the
men
of
the
tower
of
Shechem
heard
they
entered
into
an
hold
of
the
house
of
the
god
Berith.
Jdgs9:47
And
it
was
told
Abimelech,
that
all
the
men
of
the
tower
of
Shechem
were
gathered
Jdgs9:48
And
Abimelech
gat
him
up
to
mount
Zalmon,
he
and
all
the
people
that
were
with
and
Abimelech
took
an
axe
in
his
and
cut
down
a
bough
from
the
and
took
and
laid
it
on
his
and
said
unto
the
people
that
were
with
What
y
e
have
seen
me
make
and
do
as
I
have
Jdgs9:49
And
all
the
people
likewise
cut
down
every
man
his
and
followed
Abimelech,
and
put
them
to
the
and
set
the
ho
ld
on
fire
upon
so
that
all
the
men
of
the
tower
of
Shechem
died
about
a
thousand
men
and
Jdgs9:50
Then
went
Abimelech
to
Thebez,
and
encamped
against
Thebez,
and
took
Jdgs9:51
But
there
was
a
strong
tower
within
the
and
thither
fled
all
the
men
and
and
all
they
of
the
and
shut
i
t
to
and
gat
them
up
to
the
top
of
the
Jdgs9:52
And
Abimelech
came
unto
the
and
fought
against
and
went
hard
unto
the
door
of
the
tower
to
burn
it
with
Jdgs9:53
And
a
certain
woman
cast
a
piece
of
a
millstone
upon
Abimelech's
and
all
to
brake
his
Jdgs9:54
Then
he
called
hastily
unto
the
young
man
his
armourbearer,
and
said
unto
Draw
thy
and
slay
that
men
say
n
ot
of
A
woman
slew
And
his
young
man
thrust
him
and
he
Jdgs9:55
And
when
the
men
of
Israel
saw
that
Abimelech
was
they
departed
every
man
unto
his
Jdgs9:56
Thus
God
rendered
the
wickedness
of
Abimelech,
which
he
did
unto
his
in
slaying
his
seventy
Jdgs9:57
And
all
the
evil
of
the
men
of
Shechem
did
God
render
upon
their
and
upon
them
came
the
curse
of
Jotham
the
son
of
Jerubbaal.
Jdgs10:1
And
after
Abimelech
there
arose
to
defend
Israel
Tola
the
son
of
Puah,
the
son
of
a
man
of
and
he
dwelt
in
Shamir
in
mount
Jdgs10:2
And
he
judged
Israel
twenty
and
three
and
and
was
buried
in
Shamir.
Jdgs10:3
And
after
him
arose
Jair,
a
and
judged
Israel
twenty
and
two
Jdgs10:4
And
he
had
thirty
sons
that
rode
on
thirty
ass
and
they
had
thirty
which
are
called
Havothjair
unto
this
da

which
are
in
the
land
of
Jdgs10:5
And
Jair
and
was
buried
in
Camon.
Jdgs10:6
And
the
children
of
Israel
did
evil
again
in
the
sight
of
the
and
served
Baalim,
and
Ashtaroth,
and
the
gods
of
Syri
and
the
gods
of
Zidon,
and
the
gods
of
and
the
gods
of
the
children
of
and
the
gods
of
the
and
forsook
the
and
served
not
Jdgs10:7
And
the
anger
of
the
LORD
was
hot
against
and
he
sold
them
into
the
hands
of
the
and
into
the
hands
o
f
the
children
of
Jdgs10:8
And
that
year
they
vexed
and
oppressed
the
children
of
eighteen
all
the
children
of
Israel
that
were
on
the
other
side
Jordan
in
the
land
of
the
Amorites,
which
is
in
Jdgs10:9
Moreover
the
children
of
Ammon
passed
over
Jordan
to
fight
also
against
and
against
and
against
the
house
of
so
that
Israel
was
sore
Jdgs10:10
And
the
children
of
Israel
cried
unto
the
We
have
sinned
against
both
because
we
have
forsaken
our
Go
d,
and
also
served
Baalim.
Jdgs10:11
And
the
LORD
said
unto
the
children
of
Did
not
I
deliver
you
from
the
and
from
the
Amorites,
from
the
children
of
and
from
the
Jdgs10:12
The
Zidonians
and
the
Amalekites,
and
the
Maonites,
did
oppress
and
ye
cried
to
and
I
delivered
you
out
of
their
Jdgs10:13
Yet
ye
have
forsaken
and
served
other
wherefore
I
will
deliver
you
no
Jdgs10:14
Go
and
cry
unto
the
gods
which
ye
have
let
them
deliver
you
in
the
time
of
your
Jdgs10:15
And
the
children
of
Israel
said
unto
the
We
have
do
thou
unto
us
whatsoever
seemeth
good
unto
deliver
us
we
pray
this
Jdgs10:16
And
they
put
away
the
strange
gods
from
among
and
served
the
and
his
soul
was
grieved
for
the
misery
of
Israe
l.
Jdgs10:17
Then
the
children
of
Ammon
were
gathered
and
encamped
in
And
the
children
of
Israel
assembled
themselve
s
and
encamped
in
Mizpeh.
Jdgs10:18
And
the
people
and
princes
of
Gilead
said
one
to
What
man
is
he
that
will
begin
to
fight
against
the
children
of
he
shall
be
head
over
all
the
inhabitants
of
Jdgs11:1
Now
Jephthah
the
Gileadite
was
a
mighty
man
of
and
he
was
the
son
of
an
and
Gilead
begat
Jdgs11:2
And
Gilead's
wife
bare
him
and
his
wife's
sons
grew
and
they
thrust
out
and
said
unto
Thou
shalt
not
inherit
in
our
father's
for
thou
art
the
son
of
a
strange
Jdgs11:3
Then
Jephthah
fled
from
his
and
dwelt
in
the
land
of
Tob:
and
there
were
gathered
vain
men
to
and
went
out
with
Jdgs11:4
And
it
came
to
pass
in
process
of
that
the
children
of
Ammon
made
war
against
Jdgs11:5
And
it
was
that
when
the
children
of
Ammon
made
war
against
the
elders
of
Gilead
went
to
fetch
Jephthah
out
of
the
land
of
Tob:
Jdgs11:6
And
they
said
unto
and
be
our
that
we
may
fight
with
the
children
of
Jdgs11:7
And
Jephthah
said
unto
the
elders
of
Did
not
ye
hate
and
expel
me
out
of
my
father's
and
why
are
ye
com
e
unto
me
now
when
ye
are
in
Jdgs11:8
And
the
elders
of
Gilead
said
unto
Therefore
we
turn
again
to
thee
that
thou
mayest
go
with
and
fight
a
gainst
the
children
of
and
be
our
head
over
all
the
inhabitants
of
Jdgs11:9
And
Jephthah
said
unto
the
elders
of
If
ye
bring
me
home
again
to
fight
against
the
children
of
and
the
LOR
D
deliver
them
before
shall
I
be
your
Jdgs11:10
And
the
elders
of
Gilead
said
unto
The
LORD
be
witness
between
if
we
do
not
so
according
to
thy
Jdgs11:11
Then
Jephthah
went
with
the
elders
of
and
the
people
made
him
head
and
captain
over
and
Jephthah
uttered
al
l
his
words
before
the
LORD
in
Mizpeh.
Jdgs11:12
And
Jephthah
sent
messengers
unto
the
king
of
the
children
of
What
hast
thou
to
do
with
that
thou
art
come
against
me
to
fight
in
my
Jdgs11:13
And
the
king
of
the
children
of
Ammon
answered
unto
the
messengers
of
Because
Israel
took
away
my
when
th
ey
came
up
out
of
from
Arnon
even
unto
Jabbok,
and
unto
now
therefore
restore
those
lands
again
Jdgs11:14
And
Jephthah
sent
messengers
again
unto
the
king
of
the
children
of
Jdgs11:15
And
said
unto
Thus
saith
Israel
took
not
away
the
land
of
nor
the
land
of
the
children
of
Jdgs11:16
But
when
Israel
came
up
from
and
walked
through
the
wilderness
unto
the
Red
and
came
to
Kadesh;
Jdgs11:17
Then
Israel
sent
messengers
unto
the
king
of
Let
I
pray
pass
through
thy
but
the
king
of
Ed
om
would
not
hearken
And
in
like
manner
they
sent
unto
the
king
of
but
he
would
not
and
Israel
abode
in
Kad
esh.
Jdgs11:18
Then
they
went
along
through
the
and
compassed
the
land
of
and
the
land
of
and
came
by
the
east
s
ide
of
the
land
of
and
pitched
on
the
other
side
of
Arnon,
but
came
not
within
the
border
of
for
Arnon
was
the
border
o
f
Jdgs11:19
And
Israel
sent
messengers
unto
Sihon
king
of
the
Amorites,
the
king
of
Heshbon;
and
Israel
said
unto
Let
us
w
e
pray
through
thy
land
into
my
Jdgs11:20
But
Sihon
trusted
not
Israel
to
pass
through
his
but
Sihon
gathered
all
his
people
and
pitched
in
Jahaz,
and
fought
against
Jdgs11:21
And
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
delivered
Sihon
and
all
his
people
into
the
hand
of
and
they
smote
so
Israel
pos
sessed
all
the
land
of
the
Amorites,
the
inhabitants
of
that
Jdgs11:22
And
they
possessed
all
the
coasts
of
the
Amorites,
from
Arnon
even
unto
Jabbok,
and
from
the
wilderness
even
unto
Jdgs11:23
So
now
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
hath
dispossessed
the
Amorites
from
before
his
people
and
shouldest
thou
possess
it
?
Jdgs11:24
Wilt
not
thou
possess
that
which
Chemosh
thy
god
giveth
thee
to
So
whomsoever
the
LORD
our
God
shall
drive
out
f
rom
before
them
will
we
Jdgs11:25
And
now
art
thou
any
thing
better
than
Balak
the
son
of
Zippor,
king
of
did
he
ever
strive
against
or
did
h
e
ever
fight
against
Jdgs11:26
While
Israel
dwelt
in
Heshbon
and
her
and
in
Aroer
and
her
and
in
all
the
cities
that
be
along
by

therefore
did
ye
not
recover
them
within
that
Jdgs11:27
Wherefore
I
have
not
sinned
against
but
thou
doest
me
wrong
to
war
against
the
LORD
the
Judge
be
judge
this
day
between
the
children
of
Israel
and
the
children
of
Jdgs11:28
Howbeit
the
king
of
the
children
of
Ammon
hearkened
not
unto
the
words
of
Jephthah
which
he
sent
Jdgs11:29
Then
the
Spirit
of
the
LORD
came
upon
and
he
passed
over
and
and
passed
over
Mizpeh
of
Gilead
,
and
from
Mizpeh
of
Gilead
he
passed
over
unto
the
children
of
Jdgs11:30
And
Jephthah
vowed
a
vow
unto
the
and
If
thou
shalt
without
fail
deliver
the
children
of
Ammon
into
mine
hand
s,
Jdgs11:31
Then
it
shall
that
whatsoever
cometh
forth
of
the
doors
of
my
house
to
meet
when
I
return
in
peace
from
the
child
ren
of
shall
surely
be
the
and
I
will
offer
it
up
for
a
burnt
Jdgs11:32
So
Jephthah
passed
over
unto
the
children
of
Ammon
to
fight
against
and
the
LORD
delivered
them
into
his
Jdgs11:33
And
he
smote
them
from
Aroer,
even
till
thou
come
to
Minnith,
even
twenty
and
unto
the
plain
of
the
wi
th
a
very
great
Thus
the
children
of
Ammon
were
subdued
before
the
children
of
Jdgs11:34
And
Jephthah
came
to
Mizpeh
unto
his
his
daughter
came
out
to
meet
him
with
timbrels
and
with
and
she
was
his
only
beside
her
he
had
neither
son
nor
Jdgs11:35
And
it
came
to
when
he
saw
that
he
rent
his
and
my
thou
hast
brought
me
very
lo
w,
and
thou
art
one
of
them
that
trouble
for
I
have
opened
my
mouth
unto
the
and
I
cannot
go
Jdgs11:36
And
she
said
unto
My
if
thou
hast
opened
thy
mouth
unto
the
do
to
me
according
to
that
which
hath
proc
eeded
out
of
thy
forasmuch
as
the
LORD
hath
taken
vengeance
for
thee
of
thine
even
of
the
children
of
Jdgs11:37
And
she
said
unto
her
Let
this
thing
be
done
for
let
me
alone
two
that
I
may
go
up
and
down
upon
the
and
bewail
my
I
and
my
Jdgs11:38
And
he
And
he
sent
her
away
for
two
and
she
went
with
her
and
bewailed
her
virginity
upon
t
he
Jdgs11:39
And
it
came
to
pass
at
the
end
of
two
that
she
returned
unto
her
who
did
with
her
according
to
his
vow
wh
ich
he
had
and
she
knew
no
And
it
was
a
custom
in
Jdgs11:40
That
the
daughters
of
Israel
went
yearly
to
lament
the
daughter
of
Jephthah
the
Gileadite
four
days
in
a
Jdgs12:1
And
the
men
of
Ephraim
gathered
themselves
and
went
and
said
unto
Wherefore
passedst
thou
o
ver
to
fight
against
the
children
of
and
didst
not
call
us
to
go
with
we
will
burn
thine
house
upon
thee
with
Jdgs12:2
And
Jephthah
said
unto
I
and
my
people
were
at
great
strife
with
the
children
of
and
when
I
called
ye
de
livered
me
not
out
of
their
Jdgs12:3
And
when
I
saw
that
ye
delivered
me
I
put
my
life
in
my
and
passed
over
against
the
children
of
and
the
LORD
delivered
them
into
my
wherefore
then
are
ye
come
up
unto
me
this
to
fight
against
Jdgs12:4
Then
Jephthah
gathered
together
all
the
men
of
and
fought
with
and
the
men
of
Gilead
smote
becau
se
they
Ye
Gileadites
are
fugitives
of
Ephraim
among
the
Ephraimites,
and
among
the
Manassites.
Jdgs12:5
And
the
Gileadites
took
the
passages
of
Jordan
before
the
Ephraimites:
and
it
was
that
when
those
Ephraimites
which
we
re
escaped
Let
me
go
that
the
men
of
Gilead
said
unto
Art
thou

Then
said
they
unto
Say

and
he
said
Sibboleth:
for
he
could
not
frame
to
pronounce
it
Then
the
y
took
and
slew
him
at
the
passages
of
and
there
fell
at
that
time
of
the
Ephraimites
forty
and
two
Jdgs12:7
And
Jephthah
judged
Israel
six
Then
died
Jephthah
the
and
was
buried
in
one
of
the
cities
of
Jdgs12:8
And
after
him
Ibzan
of
Bethlehem
judged
Jdgs12:9
And
he
had
thirty

he
sent
and
took
in
thirty
daughters
from
abroad
for

And
he
judged
Israel
seven
Jdgs12:10
Then
died
Ibzan,
and
was
buried
at
Jdgs12:11
And
after
him
Elon,
a
Zebulonite,
judged

he
judged
Israel

Jdgs12:12
And
Elon
the
Zebulonite
and
was
buried
in
Aijalon
in
the
country
of
Jdgs12:13
And
after
him
Abdon
the
son
of
a
Pirathonite,
judged
Jdgs12:14
And
he
had
forty
sons
and
thirty

Pirathonite
and
was
buried

Pirathon
in
the
land
of

Jdgs13:1
And
the
children
of
Israel
did
evil
again
in
the
sight
of
the
and
the
LORD
delivered
them
into
the
hand
of
the
Phili
stines
forty
Jdgs13:2
And
there
was
a
certain
man
of
Zorah,
of
the
family
of
the
Danites,
whose
name
was
Manoah;
and
his
wife
was
and
ba
re
Jdgs13:3
And
the
angel
of
the
LORD
appeared
unto
the
and
said
unto
Behold
thou
art
and
bearest
but
th
ou
shalt
and
bear
a
Jdgs13:4
Now
therefore
I
pray
and
drink
not
wine
nor
strong
and
eat
not
any
unclean
Jdgs13:5
thou
shalt
and
bear
a
and
no
razor
shall
come
on
his
for
the
child
shall
be
a
Nazarite
unto
God
from
the
and
he
shall
begin
to
deliver
Israel
out
of
the
hand
of
the
Jdgs13:6
Then
the
woman
came
and
told
her
A
man
of
God
came
unto
and
his
countenance
was
like
the
countenance
of
an
angel
of
very
but
I
asked
him
not
whence
he
neither
told
he
me
his
Jdgs13:7
But
he
said
unto
thou
shalt
and
bear
a
and
now
drink
no
wine
nor
strong
neither
eat
any
unclean
for
the
child
shall
be
a
Nazarite
to
God
from
the
womb
to
the
day
of
his
Jdgs13:8
Then
Manoah
intreated
the
and
O
my
let
the
man
of
God
which
thou
didst
send
come
again
unto
and
teac
h
us
what
we
shall
do
unto
the
child
that
shall
be
Jdgs13:9
And
God
hearkened
to
the
voice
of
Manoah;
and
the
angel
of
God
came
again
unto
the
woman
as
she
sat
in
the
but
Mano
ah
her
husband
was
not
with
Jdgs13:10
And
the
woman
made
and
and
shewed
her
and
said
unto
the
man
hath
appeared
unto
that
came
unto
me
the
other
Jdgs13:11
And
Manoah
and
went
after
his
and
came
to
the
and
said
unto
Art
thou
the
man
that
spakest
unto
the
And
he
I
Jdgs13:12
And
Manoah
Now
let
thy
words
come
to
How
shall
we
order
the
and
how
shall
we
do
unto
Jdgs13:13
And
the
angel
of
the
LORD
said
unto
Manoah,
Of
all
that
I
said
unto
the
woman
let
her
Jdgs13:14
She
may
not
eat
of
any
thing
that
cometh
of
the
neither
let
her
drink
wine
or
strong
nor
eat
any
unclean
thi
ng:
all
that
I
commanded
her
let
her
Jdgs13:15
And
Manoah
said
unto
the
angel
of
the
I
pray
let
us
detain
until
we
shall
have
made
ready
a
kid
for
the
e.
Jdgs13:16
And
the
angel
of
the
LORD
said
unto
Manoah,
Though
thou
detain
I
will
not
eat
of
thy
and
if
thou
wilt
offer
a
burnt
thou
must
offer
it
unto
the
For
Manoah
knew
not
that
he
was
an
angel
of
the
Jdgs13:17
And
Manoah
said
unto
the
angel
of
the
What
is
thy
that
when
thy
sayings
come
to
pass
we
may
do
thee
Jdgs13:18
And
the
angel
of
the
LORD
said
unto
Why
askest
thou
thus
after
my
seeing
it
is
Jdgs13:19
So
Manoah
took
a
kid
with
a
meat
and
offered
it
upon
a
rock
unto
the
and
the
angel
did
wonderously;
and
M
anoah
and
his
wife
looked
Jdgs13:20
For
it
came
to
when
the
flame
went
up
toward
heaven
from
off
the
that
the
angel
of
the
LORD
ascended
in
the
flame
of
the
And
Manoah
and
his
wife
looked
on
and
fell
on
their
faces
to
the
Jdgs13:21
But
the
angel
of
the
LORD
did
no
more
appear
to
Manoah
and
to
his
Then
Manoah
knew
that
he
was
an
angel
of
the
LORD
.
Jdgs13:22
And
Manoah
said
unto
his
We
shall
surely
because
we
have
seen
Jdgs13:23
But
his
wife
said
unto
If
the
LORD
were
pleased
to
kill
he
would
not
have
received
a
burnt
offering
and
a
meat
o
ffering
at
our
neither
would
he
have
shewed
us
all
these
nor
would
as
at
this
time
have
told
us
such
things
as
these
.
Jdgs13:24
And
the
woman
bare
a
and
called
his
name
and
the
child
and
the
LORD
blessed
Jdgs13:25
And
the
Spirit
of
the
LORD
began
to
move
him
at
times
in
the
camp
of
Dan
between
Zorah
and
Eshtaol.
Jdgs14:1
And
Samson
went
down
to
Timnath,
and
saw
a
woman
in
Timnath
of
the
daughters
of
the
Jdgs14:2
And
he
came
and
told
his
father
and
his
and
I
have
seen
a
woman
in
Timnath
of
the
daughters
of
the
Phili
stines:
now
therefore
get
her
for
me
to
Jdgs14:3
Then
his
father
and
his
mother
said
unto
Is
there
never
a
woman
among
the
daughters
of
thy
or
among
all
my
that
thou
goest
to
take
a
wife
of
the
uncircumcised
And
Samson
said
unto
his
Get
her
for
for
she
p
leaseth
me
Jdgs14:4
But
his
father
and
his
mother
knew
not
that
it
was
of
the
that
he
sought
an
occasion
against
the
for
at
that
time
the
Philistines
had
dominion
over
Jdgs14:5
Then
went
Samson
and
his
father
and
his
to
Timnath,
and
came
to
the
vineyards
of
Timnath:
a
you
ng
lion
roared
against
Jdgs14:6
And
the
Spirit
of
the
LORD
came
mightily
upon
and
he
rent
him
as
he
would
have
rent
a
and
he
had
nothing
in
his
but
he
told
not
his
father
or
his
mother
what
he
had
Jdgs14:7
And
he
went
and
talked
with
the
and
she
pleased
Samson
Jdgs14:8
And
after
a
time
he
returned
to
take
and
he
turned
aside
to
see
the
carcase
of
the
there
was
a
swa
rm
of
bees
and
honey
in
the
carcase
of
the
Jdgs14:9
And
he
took
thereof
in
his
and
went
on
and
came
to
his
father
and
and
he
gave
and
they
did
ea

but
he
told
not
them
that
he
had
taken
the
honey
out
of
the
carcase
of
the
Jdgs14:10
So
his
father
went
down
unto
the
and
Samson
made
there
a
for
so
used
the
young
men
to
Jdgs14:11
And
it
came
to
when
they
saw
that
they
brought
thirty
companions
to
be
with
Jdgs14:12
And
Samson
said
unto
I
will
now
put
forth
a
riddle
unto
if
ye
can
certainly
declare
it
me
within
the
seven
day
s
of
the
and
find
it
then
I
will
give
you
thirty
sheets
and
thirty
change
of
Jdgs14:13
But
if
ye
cannot
declare
it
then
shall
ye
give
me
thirty
sheets
and
thirty
change
of
And
they
said
unto
him
,
Put
forth
thy
that
we
may
hear
Jdgs14:14
And
he
said
unto
Out
of
the
eater
came
forth
and
out
of
the
strong
came
forth
And
they
could
not
i
n
three
days
expound
the
Jdgs14:15
And
it
came
to
pass
on
the
seventh
that
they
said
unto
Samson's
Entice
thy
that
he
may
declare
unto
u

we
burn
thee
and
thy
father's
house
with

ye
called
us
to
take
that

not
Jdgs14:16
And
Samson's
wife
wept
before
and
Thou
dost
but
hate
and
lovest
me
thou
hast
put
forth
a
riddle
unto
the
children
of
my
and
hast
not
told
it
And
he
said
unto
I
have
not
told
it
my
father
nor
my
and
s
hall
I
tell
it
Jdgs14:17
And
she
wept
before
him
the
seven
while
their
feast
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
seventh
that
he
told
he

because
she
lay
sore
upon
and
she
told
the
riddle
to
the
children
of
her
Jdgs14:18
And
the
men
of
the
city
said
unto
him
on
the
seventh
day
before
the
sun
went
What
is
sweeter
than

what

stronger
than

And
he
said
unto
If
ye
had
not
plowed
with
my

had
not
found
out

And
the
Spirit
of
the
LORD
came
upon
and
he
went
down
to
Ashkelon,
and
slew
thirty
men
of

took
their
spoil

and
gave

of
garments
unto
them

expounded

And
his
anger
was

he
went
up
to
his
father's
house

Jdgs14:20
But
Samson's
wife
was
given
to
his
whom
he
had
used
as
his
Jdgs15:1
But
it
came
to
pass
within
a
while
in
the
time
of
wheat
that
Samson
visited
his
wife
with
a

he
sa
I
will
go

But
her
father
would
not
suffer
him
to
go

And
her
father
I
verily
thought
that
thou
hadst
utterly
hated
therefore
I
gave
her

younger
sister

Samson
said
concerning
Now
shall
I
be
more
blameless
than

I
do

And
Samson
went
and
caught
three
hundred
and
took
firebrands,
and
turned
tail
to

put
a
firebrand
in
the

And
when
he
had
set
the
brands
on

let
them
go

the
Philistines
came
and
burnt
her

her
father

And
Samson
said
unto
Though
ye
have
done
yet
will
I
be
avenged
of
and
after
that
I
will

And
he
smote
them

he
went
down
and
dwelt
in

Then
the
Philistines
went
and
pitched

spread
themselves

And
the
men
of
Judah

they
To

said
to

they
bound

carried
them
up

And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
loved
a
woman
in
the
valley
of
Sorek,
whose
name
was

And
the
lords
of

Philistines
came
up
unto

said
unto

Then
the
lords
of

Philistines
brought

to
her
seven
green

she
bound

she
said
unto

she
fastened

said
unto

he
awaked
out
of
his
sleep

and
went
away
with

And
she
said
unto

Jdgs16:16
And
it
came
to
when
she
pressed
him
daily
with
her
and
urged
so
that
his
soul
was
vexed
unto
Jdgs16:17
That
he
told
her
all

said
unto

when
Delilah
saw
that

had
told

called

Then
the
lords
of
the
Philistines
came
up
unto

she
made
him
sleep
upon

she
called

she
caused
him
to
shave
off
the
seven
locks

she
began
to

his
strength
went
from

he
awoke
out

he
wist
not
that
the

the
Philistines
took

put

prison

Howbeit
the
hair
of
his
head
began
to
grow

after
he
was

Then
the
lords
of
the
Philistines
gathered
them
together
for
to
offer
a
great
sacrifice
unto

it
came
to

their
hearts
were
that
they

And
they
c

for
Samson
out
of

he
made

Now
the

Samson
took

bowed
himself

Then
his
brethren

all
the
house
of
his
father
came

had
restored
the
eleven

shekels
of
silver
to

his
mother
I
had
wholly
dedicated
the
s

unto
the
LORD
from
my
hand
for
my

make
a
graven
image
and
a

therefore
I
will
restore
it
unto

Yet

restored
the
money
unto
his

In
those
days
there

in
those
days
the

sought
them
an

that
day
all
their
inheritance

And
they
passed
thence
unto

came
unto
the
house
of

Then
answered
the
five
men
that
went

And

But
the
man
would
not

but
he
rose
up

and
came
over
against

there
were
with

And
his
master
said
unto
We
will
not
turn
aside
hither
into
the
city
of
a
that
is
not
of
the
children
of
I
srael;
we
will
pass
over
to
Gibeah.
Jdgs19:13
And
he
said
unto
his
and
let
us
draw
near
to
one
of
these
places
to
lodge
all
in
Gibeah,
or
in
Rama

Jdgs19:14
And
they
passed
on

went
down
upon
them
when
they
were

which
belongeth
to
Benja
Jdgs19:15
And
they
turned
aside
to
go
in
and
to
lodge
in
Gibeah:
and
when
he
went
he
sat
him
down
in
a
street
of
the
c

for
there
was
no
man
that
took
them
into
his
house
to
Jdgs19:16
there
came
an
old
man
from
his
work
out
of
the
field
at
which
was
also
of
mount
and
he
sojour

in
Gibeah:
but
the
men
of
the
place
were
Benjamites.
Jdgs19:17
And
when
he
had
lifted
up
his
he
saw
a
wayfaring
man
in
the
street
of
the
and
the
old
man
Whither
goest
and
whence
comest
Jdgs19:18
And
he
said
unto
We
are
passing
from
Bethlehemjudah
toward
the
side
of
mount
from
thence
am
and
I
went
t
o
Bethlehemjudah,
but
I
am
now
going
to
the
house
of
the
and
there
is
no
man
that
receiveth
me
to
Jdgs19:19
Yet
there
is
both
straw
and
provender
for
our
and
there
is
bread
and
wine
also
for
and
for
thy
and
f
or
the
young
man
which
is
with
thy
there
is
no
want
of
any
Jdgs19:20
And
the
old
man
Peace
be
with
howsoever
let
all
thy
wants
lie
upon
only
lodge
not
in
the
Jdgs19:21
So
he
brought
him
into
his
and
gave
provender
unto
the
and
they
washed
their
and
did
eat
and
Jdgs19:22
Now
as
they
were
making
their
hearts
the
men
of
the
certain
sons
of

the
house
round
ab

beat
at

spake
to
the
master
of
the
the
old
Bring

the
man
that

into
thine
hous

that
we
may
know
Jdgs19:23
And
the
the
master
of
the
went
out
unto
and
said
unto
my
I
pray
do
not
s
o
seeing
that
this
man

this
Jdgs19:24
here
is
my
daughter
a
and
his
them
I
will
bring
out
and
humble
ye
and
do
with
them
what
seemeth
good
unto
but
unto
this
man
do
not
so
vile
a
Jdgs19:25
But
the
men
would
not
hearken
to
so
the
man
took
his

brought
her
forth
unto
and
they
knew
and
abused
her
all
the
night
until
the
and
when
the
day
began
to
they
let

Then
came
the
woman
in
the
dawning
of
the
and
fell
down
at
the
door
of
the
man's
house
where
her
lord
till

Jdgs19:27
And
her
lord
rose
up
in
the
and
opened
the
doors
of
the
and
went
out
to
go

the
woma

his
concubine
was
fallen
down
at
the
door
of
the
and
her
hands
were
upon
the
Jdgs19:28
And
he
said
unto

be
But
none
Then
the
man
took
her
up
upon
an
and
the
man
rose
and
gat
him
unto
his
Jdgs19:29
And
when
he
was
come
into
his
he
took
a
and
laid
hold
on
his
and
divided
together
with
her
into
twelve
and
sent
her
into
all
the
coasts
of
Jdgs19:30
And
it
was
that
all
that
saw
it
There
was
no
such
deed
done
nor
seen
from
the
day
that
the
children
of
Israel
c
ame
up
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
unto
this
consider
of
take
and
speak
your
Jdgs20:1
Then
all
the
children
of
Israel
went
and
the
congregation
was
gathered
together
as
one
from
Dan
even
to
Beersheb
with
the
land
of
unto
the
LORD
in
Mizpeh.
Jdgs20:2
And
the
chief
of
all
the
even
of
all
the
tribes
of
presented
themselves
in
the
assembly
of
the
people
of
G

four
hundred
thousand
footmen
that
drew
Jdgs20:3
(Now
the
children
of
Benjamin
heard
that
the
children
of
Israel
were
gone
up
to
Mizpeh.)
Then
said
the
children
of
Tell
how
was
this
Jdgs20:4
And
the
the
husband
of
the
woman
that
was
answered
and
I
came
into
Gibeah
that
belongeth
to
I
and
my
to
Jdgs20:5
And
the
men
of
Gibeah
rose
against
and
beset
the
house
round
about
upon
me
by
and
thought
to
have
slain
and
my
concubine
have
they
that
she
is
Jdgs20:6
And
I
took
my
and
cut
her
in
and
sent
her
throughout
all
the
country
of
the
inheritance
of
for
they
have
committed
lewdness
and
folly
in
Jdgs20:7
ye
are
all
children
of
give
here
your
advice
and
Jdgs20:8
And
all
the
people
arose
as
one
We
will
not
any
of
us
go
to
his
neither
will
we
any
of
us
turn
into
his
Jdgs20:9
But
now
this
shall
be
the
thing
which
we
will
do
to
Gibeah;
we
will
go
up
by
lot
against
Jdgs20:10
And
we
will
take
ten
men
of
an
hundred
throughout
all
the
tribes
of
and
an
hundred
of
a
and
a
thousand
out
of
ten
to
fetch
victual
for
the
that
they
may
when
they
come
to
Gibeah
of
according
to
all
the
folly
that
they
have
wrought
in
Jdgs20:11
So
all
the
men
of
Israel
were
gathered
against
the
knit
together
as
one
Jdgs20:12
And
the
tribes
of
Israel
sent
men
through
all
the
tribe
of
What
wickedness
is
this
that
is
done
among

Jdgs20:13
Now
therefore
deliver
us
the
the
children
of
which
are
in
Gibeah,
that
we
may
put
them
to
and
put
awa

evil
from
But
the
children
of
Benjamin
would
not
hearken
to
the
voice
of
their
brethren
the
children
of
Jdgs20:14
But
the
children
of
Benjamin
gathered
themselves
together
out
of
the
cities
unto
Gibeah,
to
go
out
to
battle
against
the
children
of
Jdgs20:15
And
the
children
of
Benjamin
were
numbered
at
that
time
out
of
the
cities
twenty
and
six
thousand
men
that
drew
be

the
inhabitants
of
Gibeah,
which
were
numbered
seven

Among
all
this
people
there
were
seven

Jdgs20:18
And
the
children
of
Israel
and
went
up
to
the
house
of
and
asked
counsel
of
and
Which
of
us
shall
go
up
first
to
the
battle
against
the
children
of
And
the
LORD
Judah
shall
go
up
Jdgs20:19
And
the
children
of
Israel
rose
up
in
the
and
encamped
against
Gibeah.
Jdgs20:20
And
the
men
of
Israel
went
out
to
battle
against
and
the
men
of
Israel
put
themselves
in
array
to
fight
against
them
at
Gibeah.
Jdgs20:21
And
the
children
of
Benjamin
came
forth
out
of
Gibeah,
and
destroyed
down
to
the
ground
of
the
Israelites
that
day
twenty
and
two
thousand
Jdgs20:22
And
the
people
the
men
of
Israel
encouraged
and
set
their
battle
again
in
array
in
the
place
where
they
put
t
hemselves
in
array
the
first
Jdgs20:23
(And
the
children
of
Israel
went
up
and
wept
before
the
LORD
until
and
asked
counsel
of
the
Shall
I
g

up
again
to
battle
against
the
children
of
Benjamin
my
And
the
LORD
Go
up
against
him.)
Jdgs20:24
And
the
children
of
Israel
came
near
against
the
children
of
Benjamin
the
second
Jdgs20:25
And
Benjamin
went
forth
against
them
out
of
Gibeah
the
second
and
destroyed
down
to
the
ground
of
the
children
of
Is
rael
again
eighteen
thousand
all
these
drew
the
Jdgs20:26
Then
all
the
children
of
and
all

and
came
unto
the
house
of

and
sat
there
bef

fasted
that
day
until

offered
burnt
offerings
and

offerings
before

And
the
children
of
Israel
enquired
of

ark
of
the
covenant
of
God

there
in
those
Jdgs20:28
And
Phinehas,
the
son
of
the

before

in
those
days,)
Shall
I
yet
again
go
out
to

or
shall
I
And
the
LORD
Go
for
to
morrow
I
will
deliver
them
in
to
thine
Jdgs20:29
And
Israel
set
liers
in
wait
round
about
Gibeah.
Jdgs20:30
And
the
children
of
Israel
went
up
against
the
children
of
Benjamin
on
the
third
and
put
themselves
in
array
against
Gibeah,
as
at
other
Jdgs20:31
And
the
children
of
Benjamin
went
out
against
the
and
were
drawn
away
from
the
and
they
began
to
smite
of
t
he
and
as
at
other
in
the
of
which
one
goeth
up
to
the
house
of
and
the
other
to
Gibeah
in
the
about
thirty
men
of
Jdgs20:32
And
the
children
of
Benjamin
They
are
smitten
down
before
as
at
the
But
the
children
of
Israel
Let
us
and
draw
them
from
the
city
unto
the
Jdgs20:33
And
all
the
men
of
Israel
rose
up
out
of
their
and
put
themselves
in
array
at
Baaltamar:
and
the
liers
in
wait
of
Israel
came
forth
out
of
their
even
out
of
the
meadows
of
Gibeah.
Jdgs20:34
And
there
came
against
Gibeah
ten
thousand
chosen
men
out
of
all
and
the
battle
was
but
they
knew
not
that
evil
was
near
Jdgs20:35
And
the
LORD
smote
Benjamin
before
and
the
children
of
Israel
destroyed
of
the
Benjamites
that
day
twenty
and
fiv
e
thousand
and
an
hundred
all
these
drew
the
Jdgs20:36
So
the
children
of
Benjamin
saw
that
they
were
for
the
men
of
Israel
gave
place
to
the
Benjamites,
because
they
trusted
unto
the
liers
in
wait
which
they
had
set
beside
Gibeah.
Jdgs20:37
And
the
liers
in
wait
and
rushed
upon
Gibeah;
and
the
liers
in
wait
drew
themselves
and
smote
all
the
city
with
the
edge
of
the
Jdgs20:38
Now
there
was
an
appointed
sign
between
the
men
of
Israel
and
the
liers
in
that
they
should
make
a
great
flame
with
smoke
rise
up
out
of
the
Jdgs20:39
And
when
the
men
of
Israel
retired
in
the
Benjamin
began
to
smite
and
kill
of
the
men
of
Israel
about
thirty
pers
for
they
Surely
they
are
smitten
down
before
as
in
the
first
Jdgs20:40
But
when
the
flame
began
to
arise
up
out
of
the
city
with
a
pillar
of
the
Benjamites
looked
behind
beho
ld,
the
flame
of
the
city
ascended
up
to
Jdgs20:41
And
when
the
men
of
Israel
turned
the
men
of
Benjamin
were
for
they
saw
that
evil
was
come
upon
Jdgs20:42
Therefore
they
turned
their
backs
before
the
men
of
Israel
unto
the
way
of
the
but
the
battle
overtook
and
them
which
came
out
of
the
cities
they
destroyed
in
the
midst
of
Jdgs20:43
Thus
they
inclosed
the
Benjamites
round
and
chased
and
trode
them
down
with
ease
over
against
Gibeah
toward
the
sunrising.
Jdgs20:44
And
there
fell
of
Benjamin
eighteen
thousand
all
these
were
men
of
Jdgs20:45
And
they
turned
and
fled
toward
the
wilderness
unto
the
rock
of
Rimmon:
and
they
gleaned
of
them
in
the
highways
five
tho
usand
and
pursued
hard
after
them
unto
Gidom,
and
slew
two
thousand
men
of
Jdgs20:46
So
that
all
which
fell
that
day
of
Benjamin
were
twenty
and
five
thousand
men
that
drew
the
all
these
were
men
of
Jdgs20:47
But
six
hundred
men
turned
and
fled
to
the
wilderness
unto
the
rock
Rimmon,
and
abode
in
the
rock
Rimmon
four
Jdgs20:48
And
the
men
of
Israel
turned
again
upon
the
children
of
and
smote
them
with
the
edge
of
the
as
well
the
men
of
every
as
the
and
all
that
came
to
also
they
set
on
fire
all
the
cities
that
they
came
Jdgs21:1
Now
the
men
of
Israel
had
sworn
in
Mizpeh,
There
shall
not
any
of
us
give
his
daughter
unto
Benjamin
to
Jdgs21:2
And
the
people
came
to
the
house
of
and
abode
there
till
even
before
and
lifted
up

Now
this
was
the
manner
in

time
in
Israel
concerning
redeeming
and
concerning
for
to
confirm
all
a
man
plucked
off

gave
it
to

this
was
a
testimony
in
Ruth4:8
Therefore
the

he
drew

Boaz
said

Moreover
Ruth
the
Moabitess,
the

I
purchased

Now
there
was
a
certain
man
of
Ramathaimzophim,
of

his
name
was
Elkanah,
the
son
of
Jeroham,
the
son
of
E

the
son
of
Tohu,
the
son
of
Zuph,
an
Ephrathite:

And
he
had
two

the
name
of
the
other
Peninnah:
and
Peninnah
had

And
this
man
went
up
out
of
his
city
yearly
to
worship
and
to
sacrifice
unto
the
LORD
of
hosts
in
And
the
two
sons

Hophni
and
Phinehas,
the
priests
of

And
when
the
time
was
that
Elkanah
he
gave
to
Peninnah
his
and
to
all
her
sons
and
her

But
unto
Hannah
he
gave
a
worthy
for
he
loved
but
the
LORD
had
shut
up
her
1Sm1:6
And
her
adversary
also
provoked
her
for
to
make
her
because
the
LORD
had
shut
up
her
1Sm1:7
And
as
he
did
so
year
by
when
she
went
up
to
the
house
of
the

she
provoked
therefore
she

did

Then
said
Elkanah
her
husband

why
eatest

why

So
Hannah
rose
up
after
they
had

Now
Eli
the
priest
sat
upon
a
seat
by
a
post
of

temple
of

And
she
was
in
bitterness
of
and
prayed
unto
the

wept

And
she
vowed
a
and
O
LORD
of
if
thou
wilt
indeed
look
on
the
affliction
of
thine
and
remember
and
not
forget
thine
but
wilt
give
unto
thine
handmaid
a
man
then
I
will
give
him
unto
the
LORD
all
the
days
o
f

there
shall
no
razor
come
upon

And
it
came
to
as
she
continued
praying
before
the
that
Eli
marked
her
1Sm1:13
Now
she
spake
in
her
only
her
lips
but
her
voice
was
not
therefore
Eli
thought
she
had
been
dr
unken.
1Sm1:14
And
Eli
said
unto
How
long
wilt
thou
be
put
away
thy
wine
from

And
Hannah
answered
and
my

1Sm1:17
Then
Eli
answered
and
Go
in

the
God
of
Israel
grant
thee
thy
petition
that
thou
hast
asked
of

the
woman
went

And
they
rose
up
in
the
morning
and
worshipped
before

and
came
to
their
house
to
Ramah:
and
Elkanah
knew
Hannah

remembered

Wherefore
it
came
to

the
time
was
come
about

called

all
his

up
to
offer

But
Hannah
went
not

said
unto

Elkanah
went

And
the
child
did
minister
unto
the
LORD
before
Eli
the
1Sm2:12
Now
the
sons
of
Eli
were
sons
of
they
knew
not
the
1Sm2:13
And
the
custom
with
the
people
when
any
man
offered
the
priest's
servant
while
the

was

a
fleshhook
of
three
teeth
in

And
he
struck
it
into
the

or
or
all
that
the
fleshhook
brought
up
the
priest
took
for
himself
.
So
they
did
in
Shiloh
unto
all
the
Israelites
that
came
1Sm2:15
Also
before
they
burnt
the
the
priest's
servant
and
said
to
the
man
that
Give
flesh
to
roast
for

he
will
not
have

And
if
any
man
said
unto

not
fail
to
burn

then
take
as
much
as
thy
soul
desireth;
then
he
would
answer
but
thou
shalt
give
it
me
and
if
I
will
take
it
by

Wherefore
the
sin
of
the
young
men
was
very
great
before

men
abhorred
the
offering
of

But
Samuel
ministered
before

Moreover
his

made
him
a

brought

they
went

the

Samuel
grew
before

Now
Eli
was
very
and
heard
all
that

did

all

how
they
lay

the
women
that
assembled
at

hearkened
not

would
slay

Samuel
grew

was
in

I
give
unto

of

Wherefore
kick

And
the
child
Samuel
ministered
unto
the
LORD
before
And
the
word
of
the
LORD
was
precious
in
those
there
was
no
open
1Sm3:2
And
it
came
to
pass
at
that
when
Eli
was
laid
down
in
his
and
his
eyes
began
to
wax
that
he
could
not

And
ere
the
lamp
of
God
went
out
in
the
temple
of

the
ark
of
God

Samuel
was
laid
down
to

That
the
LORD
called

he
ran
unto

he
I
called

down
And
he
went
and

1Sm3:6
And
the
LORD
called
yet
And
Samuel
arose
and
went
to

Here
am
for
thou
didst
call
And
he
I
called
my
lie
down

Now
Samuel
did
not
yet
know
the
neither
was
the
word
of
the
LORD
yet
revealed
unto

And
the
LORD
called
Samuel
again
the
third
And
he
arose
and
went
to
and
Here
am
for
thou
didst
call
And
Eli
perceived
that
the
LORD
had
called

Therefore
Eli
said
unto
lie
and
it
shall
if
he
call

thou
shalt

thy

So
Samuel
went

lay
down
in

called

at
other
Then
Samuel

I
will
perform
against
Eli
all

I
have
spoken
concerning

also
make

I
have
told

the
iniquity

he
because
his
sons
made
themselve

he
restrained

And
therefore
I
have
sworn
unto
the
house

the
iniquity
of
Eli's
house

not

said
he
unto
all
Be

on
one
and
I
and
Jonathan
my
son
will
be
on
the
other
And
the
people
said
unto
Do
what
seemeth
good
unto
1Sm14:41
Therefore
Saul
said
unto
the
LORD
God
of
Give
a

And
Saul
and
Jonathan
were
but
the
people

1Sm14:42
And
Saul
Cast
lots
between
me
and
Jonathan
my
And
Jonathan
was
1Sm14:43
Then
Saul
said
to
Tell
me
what
thou
hast
And
Jonathan
told
and
I
did
but
taste
a
little
honey
w
ith
the
end
of
the
rod
that
was
in
mine
I
must
1Sm14:44
And
Saul
God
do
so
and
more
for
thou
shalt
surely
1Sm14:45
And
the
people
said
unto
Shall
Jonathan
who
hath
wrought
this
great
salvation
in
God
as
the
LOR
D
there
shall
not
one
hair
of
his
head
fall
to
the
for
he
hath
wrought
with
God
this
So
the
people
rescued
Jon
athan,
that
he
died
1Sm14:46
Then
Saul
went
up
from
following
the
and
the
Philistines
went
to
their
own
1Sm14:47
So
Saul
took
the
kingdom
over
and
fought
against
all
his
enemies
on
every
against
and
against
the
chil
dren
of
and
against
and
against
the
kings
of
Zobah,
and
against
the
and
whithersoever
he
turned
he
vexed
1Sm14:48
And
he
gathered
an
and
smote
the
Amalekites,
and
delivered
Israel
out
of
the
hands
of
them
that
spoiled
1Sm14:49
Now
the
sons
of
Saul
were
and
Ishui,
and
Melchishua:
and
the
names
of
his
two
daughters
were
the
name
of
the
firstborn
Merab,
and
the
name
of
the
younger
Michal:
1Sm14:50
And
the
name
of
Saul's
wife
was
Ahinoam,
the
daughter
of
Ahimaaz:
and
the
name
of
the
captain
of
his
host
was
the
s
on
of
Ner,
Saul's
1Sm14:51
And
Kish
was
the
father
of
and
Ner
the
father
of
Abner
was
the
son
of
Abiel.
1Sm14:52
And
there
was
sore
war
against
the
Philistines
all
the
days
of
and
when
Saul
saw
any
strong
or
any
valiant
he
took
him
unto
1Sm15:1
Samuel
also
said
unto
The
LORD
sent
me
to
anoint
thee
to
be
king
over
his
over
now
therefore
hearken
thou
unto
the
voice
of
the
words
of
the
1Sm15:2
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
I
remember
that
which
Amalek
did
to
how
he
laid
wait
for
him
in
the
when
he
came
up
from
1Sm15:3
Now
go
and
smite
Amalek,
and
utterly
destroy
all
that
they
and
spare
them
but
slay
both
man
and
infant
an
d
ox
and
camel
and
1Sm15:4
And
Saul
gathered
the
people
and
numbered
them
in
Telaim,
two
hundred
thousand
and
ten
thousand
men
of
J
udah.
1Sm15:5
And
Saul
came
to
a
city
of
Amalek,
and
laid
wait
in
the
1Sm15:6
And
Saul
said
unto
the
Kenites,
get
you
down
from
among
the
Amalekites,
lest
I
destroy
you
with
for
ye
sh
ewed
kindness
to
all
the
children
of
when
they
came
up
out
of
So
the
Kenites
departed
from
among
the
Amalekites.
1Sm15:7
And
Saul
smote
the
Amalekites
from
Havilah
until
thou
comest
to
Shur,
that
is
over
against
1Sm15:8
And
he
took
Agag
the
king
of
the
Amalekites
and
utterly
destroyed
all
the
people
with
the
edge
of
the
1Sm15:9
But
Saul
and
the
people
spared
Agag,
and
the
best
of
the
and
of
the
and
of
the
fatlings,
and
the
and
al
l
that
was
and
would
not
utterly
destroy
but
every
thing
that
was
vile
and
that
they
destroyed
1Sm15:10
Then
came
the
word
of
the
LORD
unto
1Sm15:11
It
repenteth
me
that
I
have
set
up
Saul
to
be
for
he
is
turned
back
from
following
and
hath
not
performed
my
com
mandments.
And
it
grieved
and
he
cried
unto
the
LORD
all
1Sm15:12
And
when
Samuel
rose
early
to
meet
Saul
in
the
it
was
told
Saul
came
to
he
s
et
him
up
a
and
is
gone
and
passed
and
gone
down
to
Gilgal.
1Sm15:13
And
Samuel
came
to
and
Saul
said
unto
Blessed
be
thou
of
the
I
have
performed
the
commandment
of
the
LORD
.
1Sm15:14
And
Samuel
What
meaneth
then
this
bleating
of
the
sheep
in
mine
and
the
lowing
of
the
oxen
which
I
1Sm15:15
And
Saul
They
have
brought
them
from
the
Amalekites:
for
the
people
spared
the
best
of
the
sheep
and
of
the
to
sacrifice
unto
the
LORD
thy
and
the
rest
we
have
utterly
1Sm15:16
Then
Samuel
said
unto
and
I
will
tell
thee
what
the
LORD
hath
said
to
me
this
And
he
said
unto
Say
1Sm15:17
And
Samuel
When
thou
wast
little
in
thine
own
wast
thou
not
made
the
head
of
the
tribes
of
and
the
LO
RD
anointed
thee
king
over
1Sm15:18
And
the
LORD
sent
thee
on
a
and
Go
and
utterly
destroy
the
sinners
the
Amalekites,
and
fight
against
them
u
ntil
they
be
1Sm15:19
Wherefore
then
didst
thou
not
obey
the
voice
of
the
but
didst
fly
upon
the
and
didst
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
1Sm15:20
And
Saul
said
unto
I
have
obeyed
the
voice
of
the
and
have
gone
the
way
which
the
LORD
sent
and
hav
e
brought
Agag
the
king
of
Amalek,
and
have
utterly
destroyed
the
Amalekites.
1Sm15:21
But
the
people
took
of
the
sheep
and
the
chief
of
the
things
which
should
have
been
utterly
to
sac
rifice
unto
the
LORD
thy
God
in
Gilgal.
1Sm15:22
And
Samuel
Hath
the
LORD
as
great
delight
in
burnt
offerings
and
as
in
obeying
the
voice
of
the
Be
to
obey
is
better
than
and
to
hearken
than
the
fat
of
1Sm15:23
For
rebellion
is
as
the
sin
of
and
stubbornness
is
as
iniquity
and
Because
thou
hast
rejected
the
wo
rd
of
the
he
hath
also
rejected
thee
from
being
1Sm15:24
And
Saul
said
unto
I
have
for
I
have
transgressed
the
commandment
of
the
and
thy
because
I
fe
ared
the
and
obeyed
their
1Sm15:25
Now
I
pray
pardon
my
and
turn
again
with
that
I
may
worship
the
1Sm15:26
And
Samuel
said
unto
I
will
not
return
with
for
thou
hast
rejected
the
word
of
the
and
the
LORD
hath
rej
ected
thee
from
being
king
over
1Sm15:27
And
as
Samuel
turned
about
to
go
he
laid
hold
upon
the
skirt
of
his
and
it
1Sm15:28
And
Samuel
said
unto
The
LORD
hath
rent
the
kingdom
of
Israel
from
thee
this
and
hath
given
it
to
a
neighbour
of
that
is
better
than
1Sm15:29
And
also
the
Strength
of
Israel
will
not
lie
nor
for
he
is
not
a
that
he
should
1Sm15:30
Then
he
I
have
yet
honour
me
I
pray
before
the
elders
of
my
and
before
and
turn
a
gain
with
that
I
may
worship
the
LORD
thy
1Sm15:31
So
Samuel
turned
again
after
and
Saul
worshipped
the
1Sm15:32
Then
said
Bring
ye
hither
to
me
Agag
the
king
of
the
Amalekites.
And
Agag
came
unto
him
And
Agag
Surely
the
bitterness
of
death
is
1Sm15:33
And
Samuel
As
thy
sword
hath
made
women
so
shall
thy
mother
be
childless
among
And
Samuel
hewed
Ag
ag
in
pieces
before
the
LORD
in
Gilgal.
1Sm15:34
Then
Samuel
went
to
Ramah;
and
Saul
went
up
to
his
house
to
Gibeah
of
1Sm15:35
And
Samuel
came
no
more
to
see
Saul
until
the
day
of
his
nevertheless
Samuel
mourned
for
and
the
LORD
repente
d
that
he
had
made
Saul
king
over
1Sm16:1
And
the
LORD
said
unto
How
long
wilt
thou
mourn
for
seeing
I
have
rejected
him
from
reigning
over
fil
l
thine
horn
with
and
I
will
send
thee
to
Jesse
the
Bethlehemite:
for
I
have
provided
me
a
king
among
his
1Sm16:2
And
Samuel
How
can
I
if
Saul
hear
he
will
kill
And
the
LORD
Take
an
heifer
with
and
I
am
come
to
sacrifice
to
the
1Sm16:3
And
call
Jesse
to
the
and
I
will
shew
thee
what
thou
shalt
and
thou
shalt
anoint
unto
me
him
whom
I
name
unt
o
1Sm16:4
And
Samuel
did
that
which
the
LORD
and
came
to
And
the
elders
of
the
town
trembled
at
his
and
sai
d,
Comest
thou
1Sm16:5
And
he
I
am
come
to
sacrifice
unto
the
sanctify
and
come
with
me
to
the
And
h
e
sanctified
Jesse
and
his
and
called
them
to
the
1Sm16:6
And
it
came
to
when
they
were
that
he
looked
on
Eliab,
and
Surely
the
LORD's
anointed
is
before
1Sm16:7
But
the
LORD
said
unto
Look
not
on
his
or
on
the
height
of
his
because
I
have
refused
fo
r
the
LORD
seeth
not
as
man
seeth;
for
man
looketh
on
the
outward
but
the
LORD
looketh
on
the
1Sm16:8
Then
Jesse
called
Abinadab,
and
made
him
pass
before
And
he
Neither
hath
the
LORD
chosen
1Sm16:9
Then
Jesse
made
Shammah
to
pass
And
he
Neither
hath
the
LORD
chosen
1Sm16:10
Jesse
made
seven
of
his
sons
to
pass
before
And
Samuel
said
unto
The
LORD
hath
not
chosen
1Sm16:11
And
Samuel
said
unto
Are
here
all
thy
And
he
There
remaineth
yet
the
he
keep
eth
the
And
Samuel
said
unto
Send
and
fetch
for
we
will
not
sit
down
till
he
come
1Sm16:12
And
he
and
brought
him
Now
he
was
and
withal
of
a
beautiful
and
goodly
to
look
And
the
L
ORD
anoint
for
this
is
1Sm16:13
Then
Samuel
took
the
horn
of
and
anointed
him
in
the
midst
of
his
and
the
Spirit
of
the
LORD
came
upon
Davi
d
from
that
day
So
Samuel
rose
and
went
to
Ramah.
1Sm16:14
But
the
Spirit
of
the
LORD
departed
from
and
an
evil
spirit
from
the
LORD
troubled
1Sm16:15
And
Saul's
servants
said
unto
Behold
an
evil
spirit
from
God
troubleth
1Sm16:16
Let
our
lord
now
command
thy
which
are
before
to
seek
out
a
who
is
a
cunning
player
on
an
and
i
t
shall
come
to
when
the
evil
spirit
from
God
is
upon
that
he
shall
play
with
his
and
thou
shalt
be
1Sm16:17
And
Saul
said
unto
his
Provide
me
now
a
man
that
can
play
and
bring
him
to
1Sm16:18
Then
answered
one
of
the
and
I
have
seen
a
son
of
Jesse
the
Bethlehemite,
that
is
cunning
in
playi

and
a
mighty
valiant
and
a
man
of
and
prudent
in
and
a
comely
and
the
LORD
is
with
1Sm16:19
Wherefore
Saul
sent
messengers
unto
and
Send
me
David
thy
which
is
with
the

And
Jesse
took
an
ass
laden
with
and
a
bottle
of
and
a

sent
them
by
David
his
son
unto
1Sm16:21
And
David
came
to
and
stood
before
and
he
loved
him
and
he
became
his
armourbearer.
1Sm16:22
And
Saul
sent
to
Let
I
pray
stand
before
for
he
hath
found
favour
in
my
1Sm16:23
And
it
came
to
when
the
evil
spirit
from
God
was
upon

David
took
an

played
with
his
so
Sa

Now
the
Philistines
gathered
together
their
armies

were
gathered
together
at
Shochoh,
which
belongeth
to
Jud
and
pitched
between
Shochoh
and
Azekah,
in
Ephesdammim.
1Sm17:2
And
Saul
and
the
men
of
Israel
were
gathered
and
pitched
by
the
valley
of
Elah,
and
set
the
battle
in
array
again
st

And
the
Philistines
stood
on
a
mountain
on
the
one

Israel
stood
on
a
mountain
on
the
other

there
was
a
valley
between

there
went

And
he
stood
and
cried
unto
the

said
unto
Why

come
down
to

If
he
be
able
to
fight
with
and
to
kill
then
will
we
be
your
but
if
I
prevail
against
and
kill
then
shall
ye
be

And
the
Philistine
I
defy
the
armies
of
Israel

we
may
fight

When
Saul
and
all
Israel
heard

Now

But
David
went

returned
from
Saul

And
the
Philistine
drew
near

And
Jesse
said
unto
David

his
father's
hous

free

And
David
spake
to
the
men
that
stood
by
What
shall
be
done
to
the
man
that
killeth
this
and
take
th
away
the
reproach
from
for
who
is
this
uncircumcised
that
he
should
defy
the
armies
of
the
living
1Sm17:27
And
the
people
answered
him
after
this
So
shall
it
be
done
to
the
man
that
killeth
1Sm17:28
And
Eliab
his
eldest
brother
heard
when
he
spake
unto
the
and
Eliab's
anger
was
kindled
against
and
he
W
hy
camest
thou
down
and
with
whom
hast
thou
left
those
few
sheep
in
the
I
know
thy
and
the
naughtiness
o
f
thine
for
thou
art
come
down
that
thou
mightest
see
the
1Sm17:29
And
David
What
have
I
now
Is
there
not
a
1Sm17:30
And
he
turned
from
him
toward
and
spake
after
the
same
and
the
people
answered
him
again
after
the
former
1Sm17:31
And
when
the
words
were
heard
which
David
they
rehearsed
them
before
and
he
sent
for
1Sm17:32
And
David
said
to
Let
no
man's
heart
fail
because
of
thy
servant
will
go
and
fight
with
this
1Sm17:33
And
Saul
said
to
Thou
art
not
able
to
go
against
this
Philistine
to
fight
with
for
thou
art
but
a
and
h
e
a
man
of
war
from
his
1Sm17:34
And
David
said
unto
Thy
servant
kept
his
father's
and
there
came
a
and
a
and
took
a
lamb
out
of
t
he
1Sm17:35
And
I
went
out
after
and
smote
and
delivered
it
out
of
his
and
when
he
arose
against
I
caught
him
by
his
and
smote
and
slew
1Sm17:36
Thy
servant
slew
both
the
lion
and
the
and
this
uncircumcised
Philistine
shall
be
as
one
of
seeing
he
hath
def
ied
the
armies
of
the
living
1Sm17:37
David
said
The
LORD
that
delivered
me
out
of
the
paw
of
the
and
out
of
the
paw
of
the
he
will
delive
r
me
out
of
the
hand
of
this
And
Saul
said
unto
and
the
LORD
be
with
1Sm17:38
And
Saul
armed
David
with
his
and
he
put
an
helmet
of
brass
upon
his
also
he
armed
him
with
a
coat
of
1Sm17:39
And
David
girded
his
sword
upon
his
and
he
assayed
to
for
he
had
not
proved
And
David
said
unto
I
ca
nnot
go
with
for
I
have
not
proved
And
David
put
them
off
1Sm17:40
And
he
took
his
staff
in
his
and
chose
him
five
smooth
stones
out
of
the
and
put
them
in
a
shepherd's
bag
whi
ch
he
even
in
a
and
his
sling
was
in
his
and
he
drew
near
to
the
1Sm17:41
And
the
Philistine
came
on
and
drew
near
unto
and
the
man
that
bare
the
shield
went
before
1Sm17:42
And
when
the
Philistine
looked
and
saw
he
disdained
for
he
was
but
a
and
and
of
a
fair
co
untenance.
1Sm17:43
And
the
Philistine
said
unto
Am
I
a
that
thou
comest
to
me
with
And
the
Philistine
cursed
David
by
his
1Sm17:44
And
the
Philistine
said
to
Come
to
and
I
will
give
thy
flesh
unto
the
fowls
of
the
and
to
the
beasts
of
th
e
1Sm17:45
Then
said
David
to
the
Thou
comest
to
me
with
a
and
with
a
and
with
a
but
I
come
to
thee
in
the
name
of
the
LORD
of
the
God
of
the
armies
of
whom
thou
hast
1Sm17:46
This
day
will
the
LORD
deliver
thee
into
mine
and
I
will
smite
and
take
thine
head
from
and
I
will
give
the
carcases
of
the
host
of
the
Philistines
this
day
unto
the
fowls
of
the
and
to
the
wild
beasts
of
the
that
all
the
e
arth
may
know
that
there
is
a
God
in
1Sm17:47
And
all
this
assembly
shall
know
that
the
LORD
saveth
not
with
sword
and
for
the
battle
is
the
and
he
will
give
you
into
our
1Sm17:48
And
it
came
to
when
the
Philistine
and
and
drew
nigh
to
meet
that
David
and
ran
toward
the
army
to
meet
the
1Sm17:49
And
David
put
his
hand
in
his
and
took
thence
a
and
slang
and
smote
the
Philistine
in
his
that
t
he
stone
sunk
into
his
and
he
fell
upon
his
face
to
the
1Sm17:50
So
David
prevailed
over
the
Philistine
with
a
sling
and
with
a
and
smote
the
and
slew
but
there
wa
s
no
sword
in
the
hand
of
1Sm17:51
Therefore
David
and
stood
upon
the
and
took
his
and
drew
it
out
of
the
sheath
and
slew
hi
m,
and
cut
off
his
head
And
when
the
Philistines
saw
their
champion
was
they
1Sm17:52
And
the
men
of
Israel
and
of
Judah
and
and
pursued
the
until
thou
come
to
the
and
to
the
gates
of
Ekron.
And
the
wounded
of
the
Philistines
fell
down
by
the
way
to
Shaaraim,
even
unto
and
unto
Ekron.
1Sm17:53
And
the
children
of
Israel
returned
from
chasing
after
the
and
they
spoiled
their
1Sm17:54
And
David
took
the
head
of
the
and
brought
it
to
but
he
put
his
armour
in
his
1Sm17:55
And
when
Saul
saw
David
go
forth
against
the
he
said
unto
the
captain
of
the
whose
son
is
this
And
Abner
As
thy
soul
O
I
cannot
1Sm17:56
And
the
king
Enquire
thou
whose
son
the
stripling
1Sm17:57
And
as
David
returned
from
the
slaughter
of
the
Abner
took
and
brought
him
before
Saul
with
the
head
of
t
he
Philistine
in
his
1Sm17:58
And
Saul
said
to
Whose
son
art
thou
young
And
David
I
am
the
son
of
thy
servant
Jesse
the
Bethle
hemite.
1Sm18:1
And
it
came
to
when
he
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
unto
that
the
soul
of
Jonathan
was
knit
with
the
soul
of
Dav
and
Jonathan
loved
him
as
his
own
1Sm18:2
And
Saul
took
him
that
and
would
let
him
go
no
more
home
to
his
father's
1Sm18:3
Then
Jonathan
and
David
made
a
because
he
loved
him
as
his
own
1Sm18:4
And
Jonathan
stripped
himself
of
the
robe
that
was
upon
and
gave
it
to
and
his
even
to
his
and
to
his
and
to
his
1Sm18:5
And
David
went
out
whithersoever
Saul
sent
and
behaved
himself
and
Saul
set
him
over
the
men
of
and
he
wa
s
accepted
in
the
sight
of
all
the
and
also
in
the
sight
of
Saul's
1Sm18:6
And
it
came
to
pass
as
they
when
David
was
returned
from
the
slaughter
of
the
that
the
women
came
out
of
all
cities
of
singing
and
to
meet
king
with
tabrets,
with
and
with
instruments
of
musick.
1Sm18:7
And
the
women
answered
one
another
as
they
and
Saul
hath
slain
his
and
David
his
ten
1Sm18:8
And
Saul
was
very
and
the
saying
displeased
and
he
They
have
ascribed
unto
David
ten
and
to
me
they
have
ascribed
but
and
what
can
he
have
more
but
the
1Sm18:9
And
Saul
eyed
David
from
that
day
and
1Sm18:10
And
it
came
to
pass
on
the
that
the
evil
spirit
from
God
came
upon
and
he
prophesied
in
the
midst
of
the
hou
and
David
played
with
his
as
at
other
and
there
was
a
javelin
in
Saul's
1Sm18:11
And
Saul
cast
the
for
he
I
will
smite
David
even
to
the
wall
with
And
David
avoided
out
of
his
presence
1Sm18:12
And
Saul
was
afraid
of
because
the
LORD
was
with
and
was
departed
from
1Sm18:13
Therefore
Saul
removed
him
from
and
made
him
his
captain
over
a
and
he
went
out
and
came
in
before
the
peop
le.
1Sm18:14
And
David
behaved
himself
wisely
in
all
his
and
the
LORD
was
with
1Sm18:15
Wherefore
when
Saul
saw
that
he
behaved
himself
very
he
was
afraid
of
1Sm18:16
But
all
Israel
and
Judah
loved
because
he
went
out
and
came
in
before
1Sm18:17
And
Saul
said
to
Behold
my
elder
daughter
Merab,
her
will
I
give
thee
to
only
be
thou
valiant
for
and
fig
ht
the
LORD's
For
Saul
Let
not
mine
hand
be
upon
but
let
the
hand
of
the
Philistines
be
upon
1Sm18:18
And
David
said
unto
Who
am
and
what
is
my
or
my
father's
family
in
that
I
should
be
son
in
law
to
t
he
1Sm18:19
But
it
came
to
pass
at
the
time
when
Merab
Saul's
daughter
should
have
been
given
to
that
she
was
given
unto
Adriel
the
Meholathite
to
1Sm18:20
And
Michal
Saul's
daughter
loved
and
they
told
and
the
thing
pleased
1Sm18:21
And
Saul
I
will
give
him
that
she
may
be
a
snare
to
and
that
the
hand
of
the
Philistines
may
be
against
hi
m.
Wherefore
Saul
said
to
Thou
shalt
this
day
be
my
son
in
law
in
the
one
of
the
1Sm18:22
And
Saul
commanded
his
Commune
with
David
and
the
king
hath
delight
in
and
all
his
servants
love
now
therefore
be
the
king's
son
in
1Sm18:23
And
Saul's
servants
spake
those
words
in
the
ears
of
And
David
Seemeth
it
to
you
a
light
thing
to
be
a
king's
son
in
seeing
that
I
am
a
poor
and
lightly
1Sm18:24
And
the
servants
of
Saul
told
On
this
manner
spake
1Sm18:25
And
Saul
Thus
shall
ye
say
to
The
king
desireth
not
any
but
an
hundred
foreskins
of
the
t
o
be
avenged
of
the
king's
But
Saul
thought
to
make
David
fall
by
the
hand
of
the
1Sm18:26
And
when
his
servants
told
David
these
it
pleased
David
well
to
be
the
king's
son
in
and
the
days
were
not
exp
ired.
1Sm18:27
Wherefore
David
arose
and
he
and
his
and
slew
of
the
Philistines
two
hundred
and
David
brought
their
fores
kins,
and
they
gave
them
in
full
tale
to
the
that
he
might
be
the
king's
son
in
And
Saul
gave
him
Michal
his
daughter
to
1Sm18:28
And
Saul
saw
and
knew
that
the
LORD
was
with
and
that
Michal
Saul's
daughter
loved
1Sm18:29
And
Saul
was
yet
the
more
afraid
of
and
Saul
became
David's
enemy
1Sm18:30
Then
the
princes
of
the
Philistines
went
and
it
came
to
after
they
went
that
David
behaved
himself
mor
e
wisely
than
all
the
servants
of
so
that
his
name
was
much
set
1Sm19:1
And
Saul
spake
to
Jonathan
his
and
to
all
his
that
they
should
kill
1Sm19:2
But
Jonathan
Saul's
son
delighted
much
in
and
Jonathan
told
Saul
my
father
seeketh
to
kill
now
I
pray
take
heed
to
thyself
until
the
and
abide
in
a
secret
and
hide
1Sm19:3
And
I
will
go
out
and
stand
beside
my
father
in
the
field
where
thou
and
I
will
commune
with
my
father
of
and
wh
at
I
that
I
will
tell
1Sm19:4
And
Jonathan
spake
good
of
David
unto
Saul
his
and
said
unto
Let
not
the
king
sin
against
his
against
because
he
hath
not
sinned
against
and
because
his
works
have
been
to
thee-ward
very
1Sm19:5
For
he
did
put
his
life
in
his
and
slew
the
and
the
LORD
wrought
a
great
salvation
for
all
thou
s
awest
and
didst
wherefore
then
wilt
thou
sin
against
innocent
to
slay
David
without
a
1Sm19:6
And
Saul
hearkened
unto
the
voice
of
and
Saul
sware,
As
the
LORD
he
shall
not
be
1Sm19:7
And
Jonathan
called
and
Jonathan
shewed
him
all
those
And
Jonathan
brought
David
to
and
he
was
in
his
as
in
times
1Sm19:8
And
there
was
war
and
David
went
and
fought
with
the
and
slew
them
with
a
great
and
the
y
fled
from
1Sm19:9
And
the
evil
spirit
from
the
LORD
was
upon
as
he
sat
in
his
house
with
his
javelin
in
his
and
David
played
with
his
1Sm19:10
And
Saul
sought
to
smite
David
even
to
the
wall
with
the
but
he
slipped
away
out
of
Saul's
and
he
smote
the
javelin
into
the
and
David
and
escaped
that
1Sm19:11
Saul
also
sent
messengers
unto
David's
to
watch
and
to
slay
him
in
the
and
Michal
David's
wife
told
h
If
thou
save
not
thy
life
to
to
morrow
thou
shalt
be
1Sm19:12
So
Michal
let
David
down
through
a
and
he
and
and
1Sm19:13
And
Michal
took
an
and
laid
it
in
the
and
put
a
pillow
of
hair
for
his
and
covered
it
with
a
c
1Sm19:14
And
when
Saul
sent
messengers
to
take
she
He
is
1Sm19:15
And
Saul
sent
the
messengers
again
to
see
Bring
him
up
to
me
in
the
that
I
may
slay
1Sm19:16
And
when
the
messengers
were
come
there
was
an
image
in
the
with
a
pillow
of
hair
for
his
1Sm19:17
And
Saul
said
unto
Michal,
Why
hast
thou
deceived
me
and
sent
away
mine
that
he
is
And
Michal
answered
He
said
unto
Let
me
why
should
I
kill
1Sm19:18
So
David
and
and
came
to
Samuel
to
Ramah,
and
told
him
all
that
Saul
had
done
to
And
he
and
Samuel
wen
t
and
dwelt
in
Naioth.
1Sm19:19
And
it
was
told
David
is
at
Naioth
in
Ramah.
1Sm19:20
And
Saul
sent
messengers
to
take
and
when
they
saw
the
company
of
the
prophets
and
Samuel
standing
as
appointed
over
the
Spirit
of
God
was
upon
the
messengers
of
and
they
also
1Sm19:21
And
when
it
was
told
he
sent
other
and
they
prophesied
And
Saul
sent
messengers
again
the
thir
d
and
they
prophesied
1Sm19:22
Then
went
he
also
to
Ramah,
and
came
to
a
great
well
that
is
in
Sechu:
and
he
asked
and
Where
are
Samuel
and
And
one
they
be
at
Naioth
in
Ramah.
1Sm19:23
And
he
went
thither
to
Naioth
in
Ramah:
and
the
Spirit
of
God
was
upon
him
and
he
went
and
until
he
came
to
Naioth
in
Ramah.
1Sm19:24
And
he
stripped
off
his
clothes
and
prophesied
before
Samuel
in
like
and
lay
down
naked
all
that
day
and
all
that
Wherefore
they
Is
Saul
also
among
the
1Sm20:1
And
David
fled
from
Naioth
in
Ramah,
and
came
and
said
before
What
have
I
what
is
mine
and
what
i
s
my
sin
before
thy
that
he
seeketh
my
1Sm20:2
And
he
said
unto
God
thou
shalt
not
my
father
will
do
nothing
either
great
or
but
that
he
will
shew
it
and
why
should
my
father
hide
this
thing
from
it
is
not
1Sm20:3
And
David
sware
and
Thy
father
certainly
knoweth
that
I
have
found
grace
in
thine
and
he
Let
n
ot
Jonathan
know
lest
he
be
but
truly
as
the
LORD
and
as
thy
soul
there
is
but
a
step
between
me
and
1Sm20:4
Then
said
Jonathan
unto
Whatsoever
thy
soul
desireth,
I
will
even
do
it
for
1Sm20:5
And
David
said
unto
to
morrow
is

I
may
hide
myself
in
the
field
unto
the
third
day
at
1Sm20:6
If
thy
father

all

then
David
earnestly
asked
leave
of
me
that
he
might
run
to
Bethlehem

a

there
for

It

if
he

be
sure
that

determined
by

Therefore
thou
shalt
deal

thou

And
Jonathan
Far
be
it
from
for
if
I
knew
certainly
that
evil
were
determined
by
my
father
to
come
upon

would
not
I
tell
it
1Sm20:10
Then
said
David
to
Who
shall
tell
or
what
if
thy
father
answer
thee
1Sm20:11
And
Jonathan
said
unto
and
let
us
go
out
into
the
And
they
went
out
both
of
them
into
the
1Sm20:12
And
Jonathan
said
unto
O
LORD
God
of
when
I
have
sounded
my
father
about
to
morrow
any
or
the
third

ay,
if
there
be
good
toward

I
then
send

shew

1Sm20:13
The
LORD
do
so
and
much
more
to
but
if
it
please
my
father
to
do
thee
then
I
will
shew
it
and
send
t
hee
that
thou
mayest
go
in
and
the
LORD
be
with
as
he
hath
been
with
my

And
thou
shalt
not
only
while
yet
I
live
shew
me
the
kindness
of
the
that
I
die
1Sm20:15
But
also
thou
shalt
not
cut
off
thy
kindness
from
my
house
for
not
when
the
LORD
hath
cut
off
the
enemies
of
Dav
id
every

from
the
face
of

1Sm20:16
So
Jonathan
made
a
covenant
with
the
house
of
Let
the
LORD
even
require
it
at
the
hand
of
David's
1Sm20:17
And
Jonathan
caused
David
to
swear
because
he
loved
for
he
loved
him
as
he
loved
his
own
1Sm20:18
Then
Jonathan
said
to
To
morrow
is
the
new
and
thou
shalt
be
because
thy
seat
will
be
1Sm20:19
And
when
thou
hast
stayed
three
then
thou
shalt
go
down
and
come
to
the
place
where
thou
didst
hide
thyself
when
the
business
was
in
and
shalt
remain
by
the
stone
Ezel.
1Sm20:20
And
I
will
shoot
three
arrows
on
the
side
as
though
I
shot
at

I
will
send
a

If
I
expressly
say
unto

the
arrows

come
for
there
is
peace
to

no

But
if
I
say
thus
unto
the
young
the
arrows
are
beyond

thy

the
LORD
hath
sent
thee
1Sm20:23
And
as
touching
the
matter
which
thou
and
I
have
spoken

LORD

thee
and
me
for
1Sm20:24
So
David
hid
himself
in
the
and
when
the
new
moon
was
the
king
sat
him
down
to
eat
1Sm20:25
And
the
king
sat
upon
his
as
at
other
even
upon
a
seat
by
the
and
Jonathan
and
Abner
sat
by
Saul
's
and
David's
place
was
1Sm20:26
Nevertheless
Saul
spake
not
any
thing
that
for
he
Something
hath
befallen
he
is
not
surely
he
is
not
1Sm20:27
And
it
came
to
pass
on
the
which
was
the
second
day
of
the
that
David's
place
was
and
Saul
said
unto
Jonathan
his
Wherefore
cometh
not
the
son
of
Jesse
to
neither
nor
to
1Sm20:28
And
Jonathan
answered
David
earnestly
asked
leave
of
me
to
go
to
1Sm20:29
And
he
Let
me
I
pray
for

family

a
sacrifice
in
the
and
my
he
hath
commanded
me
to
be
and
if
I
have
found
favour
in
thine
let
me
get
I
pray
and
see
my
Therefore
he
cometh
not
unto
the
king's
1Sm20:30
Then
Saul's
anger
was
kindled
against
and
he
said
unto
Thou
son
of
the
perverse
rebellious
do
not
I
know
that
thou
hast
chosen
the
son
of
Jesse
to
thine
own
and
unto
the
confusion
of
thy
mother's
1Sm20:31
For
as
long
as
the
son
of
Jesse
liveth
upon
the
thou
shalt
not
be
nor
thy
Wherefore
now
send
and
fetch
him
unto
for
he
shall
surely
1Sm20:32
And
Jonathan
answered
Saul
his
and
said
unto
Wherefore
shall
he
be
what
hath
he
1Sm20:33
And
Saul
cast
a
javelin
at
him
to
smite
whereby
Jonathan
knew
that
it
was
determined
of
his
father
to
slay
1Sm20:34
So
Jonathan
arose
from
the
table
in
fierce
and
did
eat
no
meat
the
second
day
of
the
for
he
was
grieved
for
because
his
father
had
done
him
1Sm20:35
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
that
Jonathan
went
out
into
the
field
at
the
time
appointed
with
and
a
little
l

with

And
he
said
unto
his
find
out
now

arrows

as
the
lad
he
shot
an
arrow
beyond
1Sm20:37
And
when
the
lad
was
come
to
the
place
of
the
arrow
which
Jonathan
had
Jonathan
cried
after
the
and
Is
no
t
the
arrow
beyond
1Sm20:38
And
Jonathan
cried
after
the
Make

And
Jonathan's
lad
gathered
up
the
and
came
to
his
1Sm20:39
But
the
lad
knew
not
any
only
Jonathan
and
David
knew
the
1Sm20:40
And
Jonathan
gave
his
artillery
unto
his
and
said
unto
carry
them
to
the
1Sm20:41
And
as
soon
as
the
lad
was
David
arose
out
of
a
place
toward
the
and
fell
on
his
face
to
the
and
bowe
d
himself
three
and
they
kissed
one
and
wept
one
with
until
David
1Sm20:42
And
Jonathan
said
to
Go
in
forasmuch
as
we
have
sworn
both
of
us
in
the
name
of
the
The
LORD
b

me
and
and
between
my
seed
and
thy
seed
for
And
he
arose
and
and
Jonathan
went
into
the
1Sm21:1
Then
came
David
to
Nob
to
Ahimelech
the
and
Ahimelech
was
afraid
at
the
meeting
of
and
said
unto
Why
ar
t
thou
and
no
man
with

And
David
said
unto
Ahimelech
the
The
king
hath
commanded

hath
said
unto
Let
no
man
know
any
thing
of
the
business

I
send

what
I
have
commanded
and
I
have
appointed
my
servants
to
such

such
a

Now
therefore
what
is
under
thine
give
me
five
loaves
of
bread
in
mine
or
what
there
is
1Sm21:4
And
the
priest
answered
and
There
is
no
common
bread
under
mine
but
there
is
hallowed
if
the
youn
g
men
have
kept
themselves
at
least
from

And
David
answered
the
and
said
unto
Of
a
truth
women
have
been
kept
from
us
about
these
three
since
I
c
ame
and
the
vessels
of
the
young
men
are
and
the
bread
is
in
a
manner
though
it
were
sanctified
this
day
in
the
1Sm21:6
So
the
priest
gave
him
hallowed
for
there
was
no
bread
there
but
the
that
was
taken
from
before
the
to
put
hot
bread
in
the
day
when
it
was
taken
1Sm21:7
Now
a
certain
man
of
the
servants
of
Saul
was
there
that
detained
before
the
and
his
name
was
Doeg,
an
the
chiefest
of
the
herdmen
that
belonged
to

And
David
said
unto
Ahimelech,
And

I

And
the
priest

David
There

And
David
and
fled
that
day
for
fear
of
and
went
to
Achish
the
king
of
1Sm21:11
And
the
servants
of
Achish
said
unto
Is

they
not
sing

David

And
David
laid
up
these
words
in
his
and
was
sore
afraid
of
Achish
the
king
of
1Sm21:13
And
he
changed
his
behaviour
before
and
feigned
himself
mad
in
their
and
scrabbled
on
the
doors
of
the
and
let
his
spittle
fall
down
upon
his

Then
said
Achish
unto
his
ye
see
the

then
have
ye
brought
him
to

Have
I

mad
man

1Sm22:1
David
therefore
departed
and
escaped
to
the
cave
Adullam:
and
when
his
brethren
and
all
his
father's
house
heard
it
,
they
went
down
thither
to
1Sm22:2
And
every
one
that
was
in
and
every
one
that
was
in
and
every
one
that
was
gathered
themselve
s
unto
and
he
became
a
captain
over
and
there
were
with
him
about
four
hundred
1Sm22:3
And
David
went
thence
to
Mizpeh
of
and
he
said
unto
the
king
of
Let
my
father
and
my
I
pray
come
and
be
with
till
I
know
what
God
will
do
for
1Sm22:4
And
he
brought
them
before
the
king
of
and
they
dwelt
with
him
all
the
while
that
David
was
in
the
1Sm22:5
And
the
prophet
Gad
said
unto
Abide
not

get
thee
into
the
land
of
Then
David
departe
d,
and
came
into
the
forest
of
Hareth.
1Sm22:6
When
Saul
heard
that
David
was
and
the
men
that
were
with
(now
Saul
abode
in
Gibeah
under
a
tree
in
Ramah,
having
his
spear
in
his
and
all
his
servants
were
standing
about
him;)
1Sm22:7
Then
Saul
said
unto
his
servants
that
stood
about
Hear
ye
Benjamites;
will
the
son
of
Jesse

That
all
of

conspired
against

me

made

there

none
of
you

unto
me

Then
answered
Doeg
the

was
set
over
the
servants
of
and
I
saw
the
son
of
Jesse
coming
to
to
Ahimelech
the
son
of
Ahitub.
1Sm22:10
And
he
enquired
of
the
LORD
for

gave
him

gave
him
the
sword
of
Goliath

Then
the
king
sent
to
call
Ahimelech
the
the
son
of
Ahitub,
and
all
his
father's
the
priests
that
were
in

and
they
came

of
them
to

And
Saul
Hear

And
Saul
said
unto
Why
have
ye
conspired

hast
given
him
an

hast
enquired
of
God
for

he
should
rise
against

at
this

Then
Ahimelech
answered
the
and
And

Did
I
then
begin
to
enquire
of
God

from

not
the
king
impute

And
the
king
Thou
shalt

the
king
said
unto
the
footmen

the
servants
of
the
king
would
not
put
forth
their

And
the
king
said
to
Doeg,
Turn

And
Doeg
the
Edomite
and
he
fell
upon
the
priests

and
slew
on
that
day
fourscore

five
persons

one
of
the
sons
of
Ahimelech
the
son
of
Ahitub,
named
Abiathar,

fled
after

And
Abiathar
shewed
David
that
Saul
had
slain
the
LORD's
1Sm22:22
And
David
said
unto
Abiathar,
I
knew
it
that
when
Doeg
the
Edomite
was
that
he
would
surely
tell
I
have
occasioned
the
death
of
all
the

Then
they
told
the
Philistines

against
Keilah,
and
they
rob
the
threshingfloors.
1Sm23:2
Therefore
David
enquired
of
the
Shall

go
and
smite
these
And
the
LORD
said
unto
and
smite
the

save
Keilah.
1Sm23:3
And
David's
men
said
unto
we
be
afraid
here
in
how
much
more
then
if
we
come
to
Keilah
against
the

Then
David
enquired
of
the
LORD

the
LORD
answered
him
and
go
down
to
Keilah;
for
I
will
deliver
the
Philistines
into

So
David
and
his
men
went
to
Keilah,
and
fought
with

brought
away

smote
them
with
a

David
saved
the
inhabitants

Keilah.
1Sm23:6
And
it
came
to
when
Abiathar
the
son
of
Ahimelech
fled
to
David
to
Keilah,
that
he
came
down
with
an
ephod

his

1Sm23:7
And
it
was
told
Saul
that
David
was

And
Saul
God
hath
delivered
him
into
mine
for
he
is
shut
in

by
entering
into
a
town
that
hath

And
Saul
called
all
the
people
together
to
to
go
down
to
Keilah,
to
besiege
David
and
his

David
knew
that
Saul
secretly
practised
mischief
against

he
said
to
Abiathar

1Sm23:10
Then
said
O
LORD

Then
David
and
his

were
about
six
arose

departed
out
of
Keilah,
and
went
whithersoever
they
could

So
David's
young
men
turned

Then
Abigail
made

And
it
was

when
Abigail

lighted

bowed

And
fell
at

Upon

Let

And
now
this

son
of

the
captain
of

and
Saul
lay
in
the
and
the
people
pitched
round
about
1Sm26:6
Then
answered
David
and
said
to
Ahimelech
the
and
to
Abishai
the
son
of
Zeruiah,
brother
to
Who
will
go
down
with
me
to
Saul
to
the
And
Abishai
I
will
go
down
with
1Sm26:7
So
David
and
Abishai
came
to
the
people
by
Saul
lay
sleeping
within
the
and
his
spear
stuck
in
the
ground
at
his
but
Abner
and
the
people
lay
round
about
1Sm26:8
Then
said
Abishai
to
God
hath
delivered
thine
enemy
into
thine
hand
this
now
therefore
let
me
smite
I
pray
with
the
spear
even
to
the
earth
at
and
I
will
not
smite
him
the
second
1Sm26:9
And
David
said
to
Abishai,
Destroy
him
for
who
can
stretch
forth
his
hand
against
the
LORD's
and
be
guiltles
s?
1Sm26:10
David
said
As
the
LORD
the
LORD
shall
smite
or
his
day
shall
come
to
or
he
shall
descend
in
to
and
1Sm26:11
The
LORD
forbid
that
I
should
stretch
forth
mine
hand
against
the
LORD's
I
pray
take
thou
now
the
spe
ar
that
is
at
his
and
the
cruse
of
and
let
us
1Sm26:12
So
David
took
the
spear
and
the
cruse
of
water
from
Saul's
and
they
gat
them
and
no
man
saw
nor
knew
it
,
neither
for
they
were
all
because
a
deep
sleep
from
the
LORD
was
fallen
upon
1Sm26:13
Then
David
went
over
to
the
other
and
stood
on
the
top
of
an
hill
afar
a
great
space
being
between
1Sm26:14
And
David
cried
to
the
and
to
Abner
the
son
of
Ner,
Answerest
thou
Then
Abner
answered
and
sai
d,
Who
art
thou
that
criest
to
the
1Sm26:15
And
David
said
to
Art
not
thou
a
valiant
and
who
is
like
to
thee
in
wherefore
then
hast
thou
not
kept
thy
lord
the
for
there
came
one
of
the
people
in
to
destroy
the
king
thy
1Sm26:16
This
thing
is
not
good
that
thou
hast
As
the
LORD
ye
are
worthy
to
because
ye
have
not
kept
your
master
,
the
LORD's
And
now
see
where
the
king's
spear
and
the
cruse
of
water
that
was
at
his
1Sm26:17
And
Saul
knew
David's
and
Is
this
thy
my
son
And
David
It
is
my
my
O
1Sm26:18
And
he
Wherefore
doth
my
lord
thus
pursue
after
his
for
what
have
I
or
what
evil
is
in
mine
1Sm26:19
Now
I
pray
let
my
lord
the
king
hear
the
words
of
his
If
the
LORD
have
stirred
thee
up
against

let
him
accept

if
they
be
the

they
have
driven
me
out
this
day
from
abiding
in
the
inheritance
of

1Sm26:20
Now
let
not
my
blood
fall
to
the
earth
before
the
face
of
the
for
the
king
of
Israel
is
come
out
to
seek
a

when
one
doth
hunt
a
partridge
in
the
1Sm26:21
Then
said
I
have
my
son
for
I
will
no
more
do
thee
because
my
soul
was
precious
in
thin
e
eyes

I
have
played

and
have
erred
1Sm26:22
And
David
answered
and
Behold
the
king's
and
let
one
of
the
young
men
come
over
and
fetch
1Sm26:23
The
LORD
render
to
every
man
his
righteousness
and
his

the
LORD
delivered
thee
into
my
hand
to

I
would
not
stretch
forth
mine
hand
against
the
LORD's
1Sm26:24
as
thy
life
was
much
set
by
this
day
in
mine
so
let
my
life
be
much
set
by
in
the
eyes
of
the
and
let
him
deliver
me
out
of
all
1Sm26:25
Then
Saul
said
to
Blessed
be
my
son
thou
shalt
both
do
great
and
also
shalt
still
So
David
went
on
his
and
Saul
returned
to
his
1Sm27:1
And
David
said
in
his
I
shall
now
perish
one
day
by
the
hand
of
there
is
nothing
better
for
me
than
that
I
sho

speedily
escape
into
the
land
of
the
and
Saul
shall
despair
of
to
seek
me
any
more
in
any
coast
of
so
shall
I
escape
out
of
his
1Sm27:2
And
David
and
he
passed
over
with
the
six
hundred
men
that
were
with
him
unto
Achish,
the
son
of
Maoch,
king
of
Gath
.
1Sm27:3
And
David
dwelt
with
Achish
at

and
his
every

David
with
his
two

Jezreelitess,
and
Abigail
the
Carmelitess,
Nabal's

And
it
was
told
Saul
that
David
was
fled
to
and
he
sought
no
more
again
for
1Sm27:5
And
David
said
unto
Achish,
If
I
have
now
found
grace
in
thine
let
them
give
me
a
place
in
some
town
in
the
that
I
may
dwell
for
why
should
thy
servant
dwell
in
the
royal
city
with

Then
Achish
gave
him
Ziklag
that
wherefore
Ziklag
pertaineth
unto
the
kings
of
Judah
unto
this
1Sm27:7
And
the
time
that
David
dwelt
in
the
country
of
the
Philistines
was
a
full
year
and
four
1Sm27:8
And
David
and
his
men
went
and
invaded
the
Geshurites,
and
the
Gezrites,
and
the
Amalekites:
for
those
nations
were
of
old
the
inhabitants
of
the
as
thou
goest
to
Shur,
even
unto

land
of

And
David
smote
the

left
neither
man
nor
woman

took
away
the

t
he
and
the

came
to
Achish.
1Sm27:10
And
Achish
Whither

ye
made
a
road
to
And
David
Against
the
south
of
and
against
the
south
of
the
Jerahmeelites,
and
against
the
south
of
the
Kenites.
1Sm27:11
And
David
saved
neither
man
nor
woman
to
bring

to
Lest
they
should

So
did
and
so

And
Achish
believed
He
hath
made
his
people
Israel
utterly

he
shall
be
my
servant

it

to

said
unto

And
David
said
to
Achish,
Surely
thou
shalt
know
what
thy
servant
can
And
Achish
said
to
Therefore

Now
Samuel

all
Israel
had
lamented

buried

even
in

And
Saul
had
put

And
the
Philistines
gathered
themselves

Shunem:
and
Saul
gathered
all
Israel

pitched

Gilboa.
1Sm28:5
And
when
Saul
saw
the
host
of

1Sm28:6
And
when
Saul
enquired
of

LORD
answered
him
neither

Then
said
Saul
unto

And
the
woman
said
unto

knowest
what
Saul
hath

he
hath
cut
off
those

wherefore
then
layest

Saul
sware
to

And
when
the

cried
with
a
loud
and
the

spake
to

Then
said
Wherefore
then
dost

And
the

hath
rent

Because
thou
obeyedst
not

Now
the
Philistines
gathered
together
all
their

and
the
Israelites
pitched

And
the
princes
of

Philistines
were
wroth
with

the

Philistines
said
unto
Make

1Sm29:6
Then
Achish
called
and
said
unto
as
the
LORD
thou
hast
been

thy
going
out

thy
coming

Wherefore

And

David
took

This

And
David
came

were
so
faint

they
could
not

they
went

when
David
came
near
to

Then
answered
all

And
it
was
so
from
that
day
that
he
made
it
a

and
an
ordinance
for
Israel

And
the

said
Saul
unto
his
armourbearer,

And
when

So
Saul
and

And
when
the

And
it
came
to

came
to

and
they
fastened
his
body
to

Bethshan.
1Sm31:11
And
when
the
inhabitants
of
Jabeshgilead
heard
of
that
which
the
Philistines
had
done
to
1Sm31:12
All
the
valiant

Now
it

of
when
David
was
returned
from
the
slaughter
of
the
Amalekites,
and
David
had
abo

two
days
in
Ziklag;
2Sm1:2
It
came
even
to
pass
on
the
third
a
man
came
out
of
the
camp
from
Saul
with
his
clothes
and
earth
u
pon
his
and
so
it
when
he
came
to
that
he
fell
to
the
and
did

And
David
said
unto
From
whence
comest
And
he
said
unto
Out
of
the
camp
of
Israel

I
2Sm1:4
And
David
said
unto
How
went
the
I
pray
tell
And
he
That
the
people
are
fled
from
the
battl

and
many
of
the
people
also
are
fallen
and
and
Saul
and
Jonathan
his
son
are
dead
2Sm1:5
And
David
said
unto
the
young
man
that
told
How
knowest
thou
that
Saul
and
Jonathan
his
son
be
2Sm1:6
And
the
young
man
that
told
him
As
I
happened
by
chance
upon
mount
Gilboa,
Saul
leaned
upon
his
lo
,
the
chariots
and
horsemen
followed
hard
after
2Sm1:7
And
when
he
looked
behind
he
saw
and
called
unto

I
Here
am

And
he
said
unto
Who
art
And
I
answered
I
am

said
unto
me
I
pray
upon

anguish

come
upon
because
my
life
is
yet
whole
i

2Sm1:10
So
I
stood
upon
and
slew
because
I
was
sure
that
he
could
not
live
after
that
he
was
and
I
took
the
crown
that
was
upon
his
and
the
bracelet
that
was
on
his
and
have
brought
them
hither
unto
my

Then
David
took
hold
on
his
and
rent
and
likewise
all
the
men
that
were
with
2Sm1:12
And
they
and
and
fasted
until
for
and
for
Jonathan
his
and
for
the
people
of
the
and
for
the
house
of
because
they
were
fallen
by
the

And
David
said
unto
the
young
man
that
told
Whence
art
And
he
I
am
the
son
of
a
an
Amalekite
.
2Sm1:14
And
David
said
unto
How
wast
thou
not
afraid
to
stretch
forth
thine
hand
to
destroy
the
LORD's
2Sm1:15
And
David
called
one
of
the
young
and
Go
and
fall
upon
And
he
smote
him
that
he

And
David
said
unto
Thy
blood
be
upon
thy
for
thy
mouth
hath
testified
against

have
slain
the

And
David
lamented
with
this
lamentation
over
Saul
and
over
Jonathan
his
2Sm1:18
(Also
he
bade
them
teach
the
children
of
Judah

use
of

is
written
in

book
of
Jasher.)
2Sm1:19
The

And
it
came
to

after
that
David
enquired

they
told
That

And
David
sent
messengers
unto
the
men
of

said
unto

Ishbosheth
said
to
Wherefore
hast

was
Abner
very
wroth
for

words
of
Ishbosheth,

Am

which
against
Judah
do
shew
kindness

chargest

with
a

So
do
God
to

more
as
the
LORD
hath
sworn
to
even
so
I
do
to
2Sm3:10
To

And
he
could
not
answer
Abner
a
word
because
he
feared

And
Abner
sent
messengers
to
David
on
his
Whose
is
the
saying
Make
thy
league
with
beh
my
hand
shall
be
with

And
he
I
will
make

one
thing
I
require
of
that
Thou

And
David
sent
messengers
to
Ishbosheth

Deliver

wife
Michal,
which
I
espoused
to
me
for
an
hundre

Ishbosheth
and
took
her
from

from
Phaltiel

And
her
husband
went
with
her
along
weeping
behind
her
to
Bahurim.
Then
said
Abner
unto
And
he

And
Abner
had
communication
with
the
elders
of
Ye
sought
for
David
in
times
past
to
be
king
over

Now
then
do
for
the
LORD
hath
spoken
of
By
the
hand
of
my
servant
David
I
will
save
my
people
Israel
out
of
the
hand
of
the
and
out
of
the
hand
of
all
their

And
Abner
also
spake
in
the
ears
of
and
Abner
went
also
to
speak
in
the
ears
of
David
in
Hebron
all
that
seemed
g
ood
to
and
that
seemed
good
to
the
whole
house
of
2Sm3:20
So
Abner
came
to
David
to
and
twenty
men
with
And
David
made
Abner
and
the
men
that
were
with
him

And
Abner
said
unto
I
will
arise
and
and
will
gather
all
Israel

my
lord

they
may
make
a

that
thou
mayest

over
all
that
thine
heart
desireth.
And
David
sent
Abner
and
he
went
in

the
servants
of
David
and
Joab
came
from
pursuing
a

brought
in
a
great
spoil
with
but
Abner
w
as
not
with
David
in
for
he
had
sent
him
and
he
was
gone
in

When
Joab
and
all
the
host
that
was
with
him
were
they
told
Abner
the
son
of
Ner
came
to
the
and
he
hath
sent
him
and
he
is
gone
in

Then
Joab
came
to
the
and
What
hast
thou
Abner
came
unto
why
is
it
that
thou
hast
sent
him
and
he
is
quite
2Sm3:25
Thou
knowest
Abner
the
son
of
Ner,
that
he
came
to
deceive
and
to
know
thy
going
out
and
thy
coming
and
to
know
a

that
thou
doest.
2Sm3:26
And
when
Joab
was
come
out
from
he
sent
messengers
after
which
brought
him
again
from
the
well
of
Sirah:
but
David
knew
it
2Sm3:27
And
when
Abner
was
returned
to
Joab
took
him
aside
in
the
gate
to
speak
with
him
and
smote
him
there
under
the
fifth
that
he
for
the
blood
of
Asahel

And
afterward
when
David
heard
he
I
and
my
kingdom
are
guiltless
before
the
LORD
for
ever
from
the
blood
of
Abner
the
son
of
Ner:
2Sm3:29
Let
it
rest
on
the
head
of

on
all

Joab
and
Abishai
his
brother
slew
because
he
had
slain
their
brother
Asahel
at
Gibeon
in
the

And
David
said
to
and
to
all
the
people
that
were
with

mourn
before
And
king
David
himself
followed

they
buried
Abner
in
and
the
king
lifted
up
his
and
wept
at
the
grave
of

all
the
people
2Sm3:33
And
the
king
lamented
over

Died
Abner
as
a
fool
dieth?
2Sm3:34
Thy
hands
were
not
nor
thy
feet
put
into

a

so
fellest
And
all
the
p

wept
again
over

And
when
all
the
people
came
to
cause
David
to
eat
meat
while
it
was
yet
David
sware,
So
do
God

And
all
the
people
took
notice
of

it
pleased
as
whatsoever
the
king
did
pleased
all
the

For
all
the
people
and
all
Israel
understood
that
day
that
it
was
not
of
the
king
to
slay
Abner
the
son
of
Ner.
2Sm3:38
And
the
king
said
unto
his
Know

not
that
there
is
a
prince
and
a
great
man
fallen
this
day
in

And
I
am

when
Saul's
son
heard
that

all
the
Israelites
were

And
the
Beerothites
fled
to
Gittaim,

were
sojourners
there
until
this

And
Saul's

And
the
sons

And
they
brought
the
head
of
Ishbosheth

said
to
the
Behold

And
David
answered
Rechab

sons
of
Rimmon
the
Beerothite,
and
said
unto
As

When
one
told
Saul

took
hold
of

slew
him
in
Ziklag,
who
thought
that
I
would
have
given
him
a
reward
for

How

And
David
commanded
his
young
and
they
slew
and
cut
off
their
hands
and
their
and
hanged
them
up
over
the
pool
in
But
they
took
the
head
of
Ishbosheth,
and
buried
it
in
the
sepulchre
of
Abner
in
2Sm5:1
Then
came
all
the
tribes
of
Israel
to
David
unto
and
we
are
thy
bone
and
thy

Also
in
time
when
Saul
was
king
over
thou
wast

that
leddest
out
and
broughtest
in
and
the
LORD
said
to
Thou
shalt
feed
my
people
and
thou
shalt
be

So
all
the
elders
of
Israel
came
to
the
king
to
and
king
David
made
a
league
with
them
in
Hebron
before
the
an
d
they
anointed
David
king
over
2Sm5:4
David
was
thirty
years
old
when
he
began
to
and
he
reigned
forty
2Sm5:5
In
Hebron
he
reigned
over
Judah
seven
years
and
six
and
in
Jerusalem
he
reigned
thirty
and
three
years
over
all
Isra

and
2Sm5:6
And
the
king
and
his
men
went
to
Jerusalem
unto
the
Jebusites,
the
inhabitants
of
the
which
spake
unto
Except
thou
take
away
the
blind
and
the
thou
shalt
not
come
in
David
cannot
come
in
2Sm5:7
Nevertheless
David
took
the
strong
hold
of
the
same

the
city
of
2Sm5:8
And
David
said
on
that
Whosoever
getteth
up
to
the
and
smiteth
the
Jebusites,
and
the
lame
and
the
that
are
hated
of
David's
he
shall
be
chief
and
Wherefore
they
The
blind
and
the
lame
shall
not
come
into
the
house
.
2Sm5:9
So
David
dwelt
in
the
and
called
it
the
city
of
And
David
built
round
about
from
Millo
and
2Sm5:10
And
David
went
and
grew
and
the
LORD
God
of
hosts
was
with
2Sm5:11
And
Hiram
king
of
Tyre
sent
messengers
to
and
cedar
and
and
and
they
built
David
an
house
.
2Sm5:12
And
David
perceived
that
the
LORD
had
established
him
king
over
and
that
he
had
exalted
his
kingdom
for
his
people
Israel's
2Sm5:13
And
David
took
him
more
concubines
and
wives
out
of
after
he
was
come
from
and
there
were
yet
sons
and
d
aughters
born
to

And
these
be
the
names
of
those
that
were
born
unto
him
in
Shammuah,
and
Shobab,
and
and
2Sm5:15
Ibhar
and
Elishua,
and
Nepheg,
and
Japhia,
2Sm5:16
And
Elishama,
and
Eliada,
and
Eliphalet.
2Sm5:17
But
when
the
Philistines
heard
that
they
had
anointed
David
king
over
all
the
Philistines
came
up
to
seek
an
d
David
heard
of
and
went
down
to
the
2Sm5:18
The
Philistines
also
came
and
spread
themselves
in
the
valley
of
Rephaim.
2Sm5:19
And
David
enquired
of
the
Shall
I
go
up
to
the
wilt
thou
deliver
them
into
mine
And
the
LO
RD
said
unto
Go
for
I
will
doubtless
deliver
the
Philistines
into
thine
2Sm5:20
And
David
came
to
Baalperazim,
and
David
smote
them
and
The
LORD
hath
broken
forth
upon
mine
enemies
before
me
,
as
the
breach
of
Therefore
he
called
the
name
of
that
place
Baalperazim.
2Sm5:21
And
there
they
left
their
and
David
and
his
men
burned
2Sm5:22
And
the
Philistines
came
up
yet
and
spread
themselves
in
the
valley
of
Rephaim.
2Sm5:23
And
when
David
enquired
of
the
he
Thou
shalt
not
go
but
fetch
a
compass
behind
and
come
upon
them
ove
r
against
the
mulberry
2Sm5:24
And
let
it
when
thou
hearest
the
sound
of
a
going
in
the
tops
of
the
mulberry
that
then
thou
shalt
bestir
thysel
f:
for
then
shall
the
LORD
go
out
before
to
smite
the
host
of
the
2Sm5:25
And
David
did
as
the
LORD
had
commanded
and
smote
the
Philistines
from
Geba
until
thou
come
to
2Sm6:1
David
gathered
together
all
the
chosen
men
of
thirty
2Sm6:2
And
David
and
went
with
all
the
people
that
were
with
him
from
Baale
of
to
bring
up
from
thence
the
ark
of
God
,
whose
name
is
called
by
the
name
of
the
LORD
of
hosts
that
dwelleth
between
the
cherubims.
2Sm6:3
And
they
set
the
ark
of
God
upon
a
new
and
brought
it
out
of
the
house
of
Abinadab
that
was
in
Gibeah:
and
Uzzah
and
A
hio,
the
sons
of
Abinadab,
drave
the
new
2Sm6:4
And
they
brought
it
out
of
the
house
of
Abinadab
which
was
at
Gibeah,
accompanying
the
ark
of
and
Ahio
went
before
the
2Sm6:5
And
David
and
all
the
house
of
Israel
played
before
the
LORD
on
all
manner
of
instruments
made
of
fir
even
on
a
nd
on
psalteries,
and
on
timbrels,
and
on
cornets,
and
on
2Sm6:6
And
when
they
came
to
Nachon's
threshingfloor,
Uzzah
put
forth
his
hand
to
the
ark
of
and
took
hold
of
for
the
oxen
shook
2Sm6:7
And
the
anger
of
the
LORD
was
kindled
against
Uzzah;
and
God
smote
him
there
for
his
and
there
he
died
by
the
ark
of
2Sm6:8
And
David
was
because
the
LORD
had
made
a
breach
upon
Uzzah:
and
he
called
the
name
of
the
place
Perezuzzah
to
t
his
2Sm6:9
And
David
was
afraid
of
the
LORD
that
and
How
shall
the
ark
of
the
LORD
come
to
2Sm6:10
So
David
would
not
remove
the
ark
of
the
LORD
unto
him
into
the
city
of
but
David
carried
it
aside
into
the
house
of
Obededom
the
Gittite.
2Sm6:11
And
the
ark
of
the
LORD
continued
in
the
house
of
Obededom
the
Gittite
three
and
the
LORD
blessed
Obededom,
and
all
his
2Sm6:12
And
it
was
told
king
The
LORD
hath
blessed
the
house
of
Obededom,
and
all
that
pertaineth
unto
because
of
the
ark
of
So
David
went
and
brought
up
the
ark
of
God
from
the
house
of
Obededom
into
the
city
of
David
with
2Sm6:13
And
it
was
that
when
they
that
bare
the
ark
of
the
LORD
had
gone
six
he
sacrificed
oxen
and
fatlings.
2Sm6:14
And
David
danced
before
the
LORD
with
all
his
and
David
was
girded
with
a
linen
2Sm6:15
So
David
and
all
the
house
of
Israel
brought
up
the
ark
of
the
LORD
with
and
with
the
sound
of
the
2Sm6:16
And
as
the
ark
of
the
LORD
came
into
the
city
of
Michal
Saul's
daughter
looked
through
a
and
saw
king
David
leaping
and
dancing
before
the
and
she
despised
him
in
her
2Sm6:17
And
they
brought
in
the
ark
of
the
and
set
it
in
his
in
the
midst
of
the
tabernacle
that
David
had
pitched
for
and
David
offered
burnt
offerings
and
peace
offerings
before
the
2Sm6:18
And
as
soon
as
David
had
made
an
end
of
offering
burnt
offerings
and
peace
he
blessed
the
people
in
the
name
of
the
LORD
of
2Sm6:19
And
he
dealt
among
all
the
even
among
the
whole
multitude
of
as
well
to
the
women
as
to
every
one
a
ca

a
good
piece
of

a
flagon
of
So
all
the
people
departed
every
one
to
his

Then
David
returned
to
bless

And
Michal
the
daughter
of
Saul
came
out
to
meet
and
How
glorious
was
the
king
of
Israel
to
who
uncovered
himself
to
day
in
the
eyes
of
the
handmaids
of
his
as
one
of
the
vain
fellow

shamelessly
uncovereth
2Sm6:21
And
David
said
unto
Michal,
It
was
before
the
which
chose
me
before
thy
and
before
all
his
to
appoint
me
ruler
over
the
people
of
the
over
therefore
will
I
play
before
the
2Sm6:22
And
I
will
yet
be
more
vile
than
and
will
be
base
in
mine
own
and
of
the
maidservants
which
thou
hast
spoken
o
f,
of
them
shall
I
be
had
in
2Sm6:23
Therefore
Michal
the
daughter
of
Saul
had
no
child
unto
the
day
of
her
2Sm7:1
And
it
came
to
when
the
king
sat
in
his
and
the
LORD
had
given
him
rest
round
about
from
all
his
2Sm7:2
That
the
king
said
unto
Nathan
the
See
I

in
an
house
of
but
the
ark
of
God
dwelleth
within

2Sm7:3
And
Nathan
said
to
the
do
all
that
is
in
thine
for
the
LORD
is
with
2Sm7:4
And
it
came
to
pass
that
that
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
2Sm7:5
Go
and
tell
my
servant
Thus
saith
the
Shalt
thou
build
me
an
house
for
me
to
dwell
2Sm7:6
Whereas
I
have
not
dwelt
in
any
house
since
the
time
that
I
brought
up
the
children
of
Israel
out
of
even
to
this
day
,
but
have
walked
in
a
tent
and
in
a
2Sm7:7
In
all
the
places
wherein
I
have
walked
with
all
the
children
of
Israel
spake
I
a
word
with
any
of
the
tribes
of
who
m
I
commanded
to
feed
my
people
Why
build
ye
not
me
an
house
of
2Sm7:8
Now
therefore
so
shalt
thou
say
unto
my
servant
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
I
took
thee
from
the
from
fo
llowing
the
to
be
ruler
over
my
over
2Sm7:9
And
I
was
with
thee
whithersoever
thou
wentest,
and
have
cut
off
all
thine
enemies
out
of
thy
and
have
made
thee
a
gr
eat
like
unto
the
name
of
the
great
men
that
are
in
the
2Sm7:10
Moreover
I
will
appoint
a
place
for
my
people
and
will
plant
that
they
may
dwell
in
a
place
of
their
and
move
no
neither
shall
the
children
of
wickedness
afflict
them
any
as
2Sm7:11
And
as
since
the
time
that
I
commanded
judges
to
be
over
my
people
and
have
caused
thee
to
rest
from
all
thine
enem
ies.
Also
the
LORD
telleth
thee
that
he
will
make
thee
an
2Sm7:12
And
when
thy
days
be
and
thou
shalt
sleep
with
thy
I
will
set
up
thy
seed
after
which
shall
proce
ed
out
of
thy
and
I
will
establish
his
2Sm7:13
He
shall
build
an
house
for
my
and
I
will
stablish
the
throne
of
his
kingdom
for
2Sm7:14
I
will
be
his
and
he
shall
be
my
If
he
commit
I
will
chasten
him
with
the
rod
of
and
with
the
s
tripes
of
the
children
of
2Sm7:15
But
my
mercy
shall
not
depart
away
from
as
I
took
it
from
whom
I
put
away
before
2Sm7:16
And
thine
house
and
thy
kingdom
shall
be
established
for
ever
before
thy
throne
shall
be
established
for
2Sm7:17
According
to
all
these
and
according
to
all
this
so
did
Nathan
speak
unto
2Sm7:18
Then
went
king
David
and
sat
before

he
Who
am
O
Lord
and
what
is
my
that
thou
hast
b
rought
me
2Sm7:19
And
this
was
yet
a
small
thing
in
thy
O
Lord
but
thou
hast
spoken
also
of
thy
servant's
house
for
a
great
while
to
And
is
this
the
manner
of
O
Lord
2Sm7:20
And
what
can
David
say
more
unto
for

For
thy
word's
and
according
to
thine
own
hast
thou
done
all
these
great
to
make
thy
servant
know
them

2Sm7:22
Wherefore
thou
art
O
LORD
for
there
is
none
like
neither
is
there
any
God
beside
according
to
all

have
heard
with
our

And
what

went
to
redeem
for
a

and
for

thou
redeemedst

For

hast
confirmed
to
thyself

people
Israel
to
be

thee
for

art
become

And

let
the
house
of

For

thy
servant

in
his
heart

And
O
Lord

art
that
and
thy
words

thou
hast
promised
this
goodness
unto
thy

Therefore
now

with
thy
blessing
let

And
after
this

And

When

Then
Toi

And

Then

David
and
all
the
people
returned
unto

And
it
came
to
pass
after
that
Absalom
the
son
of
David
had
a
fair
whose
name
was
Tamar;
and
Amnon
the
son
of
David
loved

And
Amnon
was
so
that
he
fell
sick
for
his

Amnon
thought
it
hard
for
him
to
do
anything

But
Amnon
had
a
whose
name
was
Jonadab,
the
son
of
Shimeah
David's

Jonadab
was
a
very
subtil
2Sm13:4
And
he
said
unto
Why
art
being
the
king's
lean
from
day
to

not

And
Amnon
said
unto
I
love
Tamar,
my
brother
Absalom's
2Sm13:5
And
Jonadab
said
unto

thee
down

it
at

So
Amnon
lay
and
made
himself
and
when
the
king
was
come
to
see
Amnon
said
unto
the
I

Tamar

sister

make
me
a
couple
of
cakes

I
may

her
2Sm13:7
Then
David
sent
home
to
Tamar,
Go
now
to
thy
brother
Amnon's
and
dress
him
2Sm13:8
So
Tamar
went
to
her
brother
Amnon's
and
he
was
laid

she
took

kneaded

made
cakes

And
Amnon
said
unto
Tamar,
Bring
the
meat
into

that
I
may
eat
of
thine
And
Tamar
took
the
cakes
which
s
he
had
and
brought
them
into
the
chamber
to
Amnon
her
2Sm13:11
And
when
she
had
brought
them
unto
him
to

took

said
unto

And
whither

I
cause

of
the
fools

Now
I
pray

Howbeit
he
would
not
hearken
unto
her
being
stronger
than
forced
and
lay
with

Then
Amnon
hated
her
so
that
the
hatred
wherewith
he
hated
her
was
greater
than
the
love
wherewith
he
had
lov

And
Amnon
said
unto

And
she
said
unto
There

me
away

greater
than
the
other
that
thou
didst
unto
But
he
would
not
hearken
unto
2Sm13:17
Then
he
called
his
servant
that
ministered
unto
and
Put
now
this
woman
out
from
and
bolt
the
door
after
her
.
2Sm13:18
And
she
had
a
garment
of
divers
colours
upon
for
with
such
robes
were
the
king's
daughters
that
were
virgins
apparell
Then
his
servant
brought
her
and
bolted
the
door
after
2Sm13:19
And
Tamar
put
ashes
on
her
and
rent
her
garment
of
divers
colours
that
was
on
and
laid
her
hand
on
her

on

And
Absalom
her
brother
said
unto
Hath
Amnon
thy
brother
been
with
but
hold
now

he
is

regard
not

So
Tamar
remained
desolate
in
her
brother
Absalom's
2Sm13:21
But
when
king
David
heard
of
all
these
he
was
very
2Sm13:22
And
Absalom
spake
unto
his
brother
Amnon
neither
good
nor
for
Absalom
hated
Amnon,
because
he
had
forced
his
sister
T
amar.
2Sm13:23
And
it
came
to
pass
after
two
full
that
Absalom
had
sheepshearers
in
Baalhazor,
which
is
beside
and
Absalo
m
invited
all
the
king's
2Sm13:24
And
Absalom
came
to
the
and
Behold
thy
servant
hath
sheepshearers;
let
the
I
beseech
and
his
servants
go
with
thy

And
the
king
said
to
my
let
us
not
all
now
lest
we
be
chargeable
unto
And
he
pressed
how

he
would

but
blessed

Then
said
If
I
pray
let
my
brother
Amnon
go
with
And
the
king
said
unto
Why
should
he
go
with
2Sm13:27
But
Absalom
pressed
that
he
let
Amnon
and
all
the
king's
sons
go
with
2Sm13:28
Now
Absalom
had
commanded
his
Mark
ye
now
when
Amnon's
heart
is
merry
with
and
when
I
say
unto
you
,
Smite
Amnon;
then
kill

not
I
commanded

and
be
2Sm13:29
And
the
servants
of
Absalom
did
unto
Amnon
as
Absalom
had
Then
all
the
king's
sons
and
every
man
gat
him
up
upon
his
and
2Sm13:30
And
it
came
to
while
they
were
in
the
that
tidings
came
to
Absalom
hath
slain
all
the
king's
son

and
there
is
not
one
of
them
2Sm13:31
Then
the
king
and
tare
his
and
lay
on
the
and
all
his
servants
stood
by
with
their
clothes
2Sm13:32
And
Jonadab,
the
son
of
Shimeah
David's
answered
and
Let
not
my
lord
suppose
that
they
have
slain
all

the
appointment
of
Absalom
this
hath
been
determined
from
the
day
that
he
forced
his
sister
Tamar.
2Sm13:33
Now
therefore
let
not
my
lord
the
king
take
the
thing
to
his
to
think
that
all
the
king's
sons
are
for
Amnon

2Sm13:34
But
Absalom
And
the
young
man
that
kept
the
watch
lifted
up
his
and
there
came
much
peopl

by
the
way
of
the
hill
side
behind
2Sm13:35
And
Jonadab
said
unto
the
the
king's
sons
as
thy
servant
so
it
2Sm13:36
And
it
came
to
as
soon
as
he
had
made
an
end
of
the
king's
sons
and
lifted
up
their
vo
ice
and
and
the
king
also
and
all
his
servants
wept
very
2Sm13:37
But
Absalom
and
went
to
Talmai,
the
son
of
Ammihud,
king
of
Geshur.
And
David
mourned
for
his
son
every
2Sm13:38
So
Absalom
and
went
to
Geshur,
and
was
there
three
2Sm13:39
And
the
soul
of
king
David
longed
to
go
forth
unto
for
he
was
comforted
concerning
Amnon,
seeing

And
Joab
sent

fetched
thence

said
unto

And

Joab
put
the
words

And
the
king
said
unto

I

And
the
woman
of
Tekoah
said

Then
said
I
pray
let

Then
the
woman
Let

pray
speak

word
unto
my
lord

And
he
Say
2Sm14:13
And
the
woman
Wherefore
then
hast
thou
thought
such
a
thing
against
the
people
of
for
the
king
doth
speak
this
thing
as
one
which
is
in

For
we

Now
therefore
that
I
am
come
to
speak
of
this
thing
unto
my
lord
the
it
is
because
the
people
have
made
me

I
will
now
speak
unto

For

Then
thine

The

therefore

Then
the
king
answered
and
said
unto
the
Hide
not
from
I
pray
the
thing
that
I
shall
ask
And
the
wo

And
the
king
Is
not

hand
of
Joab
with
thee
in
all
And
the
woman
answered
and
As
thy
soul
my
lord
the
none
can
turn
to
the
right
hand
or
to

left
from

that
my
lord
the
king
hath
for

bade
and
he
put
all
these
words
in
the
mouth
of
thine
2Sm14:20
To
fetch
about
this
form
of
speech
hath
thy
servant
Joab
done
this
and
my
lord
is
according
to
the
wisdom
of
an
angel
of
to
know
all
things
that
are
in
the
2Sm14:21
And
the
king
said
unto
Behold
I
have
done
this
go
bring
the
young
man
Absalom
2Sm14:22
And
Joab
fell
to
the
ground
on
his
and
bowed
and
thanked
the
and
Joab
To
day
thy
servant

have
found
grace
in
thy

O
in
that
the
king
hath
fulfilled
the
request
of
his
2Sm14:23
So
Joab
arose
and
went
to
Geshur,
and
brought
Absalom
to
2Sm14:24
And
the
king
Let
him
turn
to
his
own
and
let
him
not
see
my
So
Absalom
returned
to
his
own
and
s
aw
not
the
king's
2Sm14:25
But
in
all
Israel
there
was
none
to
be
so
much
praised
as
Absalom
for
his
from
the
sole
of
his
foot
even
to
the
cr
own
of
his
head
there
was
no
blemish
in
2Sm14:26
And
when
he
polled
his
(for
it
was
at
every
year's
end
that
he
polled
because
the
hair
was
heavy
on
therefo
re
he
polled
it:)
he
weighed
the
hair
of
his
head
at
two
hundred
shekels
after
the
king's
2Sm14:27
And
unto
Absalom
there
were
born
three
and
one
whose
name
was
Tamar:
she
was
a
woman
of
a
fair
countenance
.
2Sm14:28
So
Absalom
dwelt
two
full
years
in
and
saw
not
the
king's
2Sm14:29
Therefore
Absalom
sent
for
to
have
sent
him
to
the
but
he
would
not
come
to
and
when
he
sent
again
the

he
would

Therefore
he
said
unto
his
Joab's
field

near
and
he
hath

and
set
it
on
And
Absalom's
servants
set
the
field
on
2Sm14:31
Then
Joab
and
came
to
Absalom
unto
his
and
said
unto
Wherefore
have
thy
servants
set
my
field
on
2Sm14:32
And
Absalom
answered
I
sent
unto
Come
that
I
may
send
thee

am
I
come
from
Geshur?
it
had
been
good
for
me
to
have
been
there
now
therefore
let
me
see
the
king's
and
if
there
be
any
iniquity
in
let
him
kill
2Sm14:33
So
Joab
came
to
the
and
told
and
when
he
had
called
for
he
came
to
the
and
bowed
himself
on
his
face
to
the
ground
before
the
and
the
king
kissed
2Sm15:1
And
it
came
to
pass
after
that
Absalom
prepared
him
chariots
and
and
fifty
men
to
run
before
2Sm15:2
And
Absalom
rose
up
and
stood
beside
the
way
of
the
and
it
was
that
when
any
man
that
had
a
controversy
ca
me
to
the
king
for
then
Absalom
called
unto
and
Of
what
city
art
And
he
Thy
servant
is
of
one
of
t
he
tribes
of
2Sm15:3
And
Absalom
said
unto
thy
matters
are
good
and
but
there
is
no
man
deputed
of
the
king
to
hear
2Sm15:4
Absalom
said
Oh
that
I
were
made
judge
in
the
that
every
man
which
hath
any
suit
or
cause
might
come
unto
m
e,
and
I
would
do
him
2Sm15:5
And
it
was
that
when
any
man
came
nigh
to
him
to
do
him
he
put
forth
his
and
took
and
kissed
2Sm15:6
And
on
this
manner
did
Absalom
to
all
Israel
that
came
to
the
king
for
so
Absalom
stole
the
hearts
of
the
men
of
2Sm15:7
And
it
came
to
pass
after
forty
that
Absalom
said
unto
the
I
pray
let
me
go
and
pay
my
which
I
have
vowed
unto
the
in
2Sm15:8
For
thy
servant
vowed
a
vow
while
I
abode
at
Geshur
in
If
the
LORD
shall
bring
me
again
indeed
to
then
I
will
serve
the
2Sm15:9
And
the
king
said
unto
Go
in
So
he
and
went
to

But
Absalom
sent
spies
throughout
all
the
tribes
of
As
soon
as
ye
hear
the
sound
of
the
then
ye

hall
Absalom
reigneth
in

And
with
Absalom
went
two
hundred
men
out
of
that
were
and
they
went
in
their
and
they
knew
not
any

And
Absalom
sent
for
Ahithophel
the
Gilonite,
David's

his
even
from
Giloh,
while
he
offered
sacrifi

And
the
conspiracy
was
for
the
people
increased
continually
with

And
there
came
a
messenger
to
The
hearts
of

And
David
said
unto
all
his
servants

And
the
king's
servants
said
unto
the
thy

ready
to

lord
the
king

2Sm15:16
And
the
king
went

And
the

And
the
king
went
and
all
the
people
after
and
tarried
in
a
place
that
was
far

And
all
his
servants
passed
on
beside

And
David
said
to
Ittai,
Go

And
Ittai
the
Gittite
passed

all
his
and
all
the
little

And
all

country
wept
with
a
loud
and
all
the
people
passed

himself

over

And

The
king
said
also
unto
Zadok
the
Art

Zadok
therefore
and
Abiathar
carried

they
tarried

And
David
went
up
by
the
ascent
of
mount
Olivet,
and
wept
as
he

David
O

And
it
came
to
that
when
David

So
Hushai
David's
friend
came

And
when
David

thus
said
Shimei
when

so
let

Ahithophel
with
2Sm16:16
And
it
came
to
when
Hushai
the
Archite,
David's
was
come
unto
that
Hushai
said
unto
God
sa
ve
the
God
save
the
2Sm16:17
And
Absalom
said
to
Hushai,
Is
this
thy
kindness
to
thy
why
wentest
thou
not
with
thy
2Sm16:18
And
Hushai
said
unto
but
whom
the
and
this
and
all
the
men
of
his
will
I
a
nd
with
him
will
I
2Sm16:19
And
whom
should
I
should
I
not
serve
in
the
presence
of
his
as
I
have
served
in
thy
father's
so
will
I
be
in
thy
2Sm16:20
Then
said
Absalom
to
Give
counsel
among
you
what
we
shall
2Sm16:21
And
Ahithophel
said
unto
Go
in
unto
thy
father's
which
he
hath
left
to
keep
the
and
all
Israel
shall
hear
that
thou
art
abhorred
of
thy
then
shall
the
hands
of
all
that
are
with
thee
be
2Sm16:22
So
they
spread
Absalom
a
tent
upon
the
top
of
the
and
Absalom
went
in
unto
his
father's
concubines
in
the
sight
of
all
2Sm16:23
And
the
counsel
of
which
he
counselled
in
those
was
as
if
a
man
had
enquired
at
the
oracle
of
so
wa
s
all
the
counsel
of
Ahithophel
both
with
David
and
with
2Sm17:1
Moreover
Ahithophel
said
unto
Let
me
now
choose
out
twelve
thousand
and
I
will
arise
and
pursue
after
David
t
his
2Sm17:2
And
I
will
come
upon
him
while
he
is
weary
and
weak
and
will
make
him
and
all
the
people
that
are
with
him
shall
and
I
will
smite
the
king
2Sm17:3
And
I
will
bring
back
all
the
people
unto
the
man
whom
thou
seekest
is
as
if
all
so
all
the
people
shall
be
in
2Sm17:4
And
the
saying
pleased
Absalom
and
all
the
elders
of
2Sm17:5
Then
said
Call
now
Hushai
the
Archite
and
let
us
hear
likewise
what
he
2Sm17:6
And
when
Hushai
was
come
to
Absalom
spake
unto
Ahithophel
hath
spoken
after
this
shall
we
do
after
his
if
speak
2Sm17:7
And
Hushai
said
unto
The
counsel
that
Ahithophel
hath
given
is
not
good
at
this
2Sm17:8
said
Hushai,
thou
knowest
thy
father
and
his
that
they
be
mighty
and
they
be
chafed
in
their
as
a
bea
r
robbed
of
her
whelps
in
the
and
thy
father
is
a
man
of
and
will
not
lodge
with
the
2Sm17:9
he
is
hid
now
in
some
or
in
some
other
and
it
will
come
to
when
some
of
them
be
overthrown
at
the
that
whosoever
heareth
it
will
There
is
a
slaughter
among
the
people
that
follow
2Sm17:10
And
he
also
that
is
whose
heart
is
as
the
heart
of
a
shall
utterly
for
all
Israel
knoweth
that
thy
fa
ther
is
a
mighty
and
they
which
be
with
him
are
valiant
2Sm17:11
Therefore
I
counsel
that
all
Israel
be
generally
gathered
unto
from
Dan
even
to
as
the
sand
that
is
by
th
e
sea
for
and
that
thou
go
to
battle
in
thine
own
2Sm17:12
So
shall
we
come
upon
him
in
some
place
where
he
shall
be
and
we
will
light
upon
him
as
the
dew
falleth
on
the
grou
and
of
him
and
of
all
the
men
that
are
with
him
there
shall
not
be
left
so
much
as
2Sm17:13
if
he
be
gotten
into
a
then
shall
all
Israel
bring
ropes
to
that
and
we
will
draw
it
into
the
until
there
be
not
one
small
stone
found
2Sm17:14
And
Absalom
and
all
the
men
of
Israel
The
counsel
of
Hushai
the
Archite
is
better
than
the
counsel
of
Fo
r
the
LORD
had
appointed
to
defeat
the
good
counsel
of
to
the
intent
that
the
LORD
might
bring
evil
upon

Then
said
Hushai
unto
Zadok
and
to
Abiathar
the
Thus
and
thus
did
Ahithophel
counsel
Absalom
and
the
elders
of
Is
rael;
and
thus
and
thus
have
I

Now
therefore
send
and
tell

not
this
night
in
the
plains
of
the
but
speedily
pas

lest
the
king
be
swallowed
and
all
the
people
that
are
with

Now
Jonathan
and
Ahimaaz
stayed
by
Enrogel;
for
they
might
not
be
seen
to
come
into

a
wench
went
and
told

they
went
and
told
king
2Sm17:18
Nevertheless
a
lad
saw
and
told
but
they
went
both
of
them
away
and
came
to
a
man's
house
in
Bahur
which
had
a
well
in
his
whither
they
went
2Sm17:19
And
the
woman
took
and
spread
a
covering
over
the
well's
and
spread
ground
corn
and
the
thing
was
not

And
when
Absalom's
servants
came
to
the
woman

Where

And
the

said

when
they
had
sought
and
could
not
find
they
returned
to

And
it
came
to
after
they
were
that
they
came
up
out
of
the
and
went
and
told
king
and
said
u

and
pass
quickly
over
the
for
thus
hath
Ahithophel
counselled
against

Then
David
and
all
the
people
that
were
with
and
they
passed
over
by
the
morning
light
there
lacked
no
t
one
of
them
that
was
not
gone
over

And
when
Ahithophel
saw
that
his
counsel
was
not
he
saddled
his
and
and
gat
him
home
to
his
t

his
and
put
his
household
in
and
hanged
and
and
was
buried
in
the
sepulchre
of

Then
David
came
to
Mahanaim.
And
Absalom
passed
over
he
and
all
the
men
of
Israel
with

And
Absalom
made
Amasa
captain
of
the
host
instead
of

Amasa
was

name
was

Israelite

that
went
in
to
Abigail

daughter
of
Nahash,
sister
to
Zeruiah

So
Israel
and
Absalom
pitched
in

land
of

And
it
came
to
when
David
was
come
to
Mahanaim,
that

son
of

of
Rabbah
of
the
children

The

And
David
numbered
the
people
that
were
with
and
set
captains
of
thousands
and
captains
of
hundreds
over

And
David
sent
forth
a
third
part
of
the
people
under
the
hand
of
and
a
third
part
under
the
hand
of
Abishai
the
son
of
Zeruiah,
Joab's
and
a
third
part
under
the
hand
of
Ittai
the
Gittite.
And
the
king
said
unto
the
I
will
surely
go
forth
with
you
myself

But
the
people
Thou
shalt
not
go
for

we
flee
they
will
not
care
for
neither
if
half
of
us
die

will
they
care
for
but
now
thou
art
worth
ten
thousand
of
therefore
now
it
is
better
that
thou
succour
us
out
of
the
city

2Sm18:4
And
the
king
said
unto
What
seemeth
you
best
I
will
And
the
king
stood
by
the
gate
and
all
the
people
came
out
by
hundreds
and
by

And
the
king
commanded
Joab
and
Abishai
and
Ittai,
Deal

my
sake
with

So
the
people
went
out
into
the
field
against

the
battle
was
in
the
wood
of

Where
the
people
of
Israel
were
slain
before
the
servants

there
was
there
a
great
slaughter

day
of

For
the
battle

scattered
over

devoured
more

And
Absalom
met

And
Absalom
rode
upon

thick
boughs
of

Joab
said
unto
the
man
that
told
thou
sawest

why
didst
thou
not

him
there
to

and
I
would
have
given
thee
ten

And
the
man
said
unto
Though
I
should
receive
a

shekels
of
silver
in
mine
yet
would
I
not
put
forth

in
our
hearing
the
king
charged
thee

Abishai
and
Ittai,
Beware
that
none
touch

young
man

Otherwise
I
should
have
wrought
falsehood
against

he
took
three
darts
in

thrust
them
through

the

returned
from
pursuing

held
back

And
they
took

cast
him
into
a
great

laid
a
very
great

of
stones

Absalom
in
his
lifetime
had
taken

Then
said
Ahimaaz
the
son
of
Zadok,
Let

bear
the
king
how

the
LORD
hath
avenged
him
of

And
Joab
said
unto

hast
thou
not
kept

oath
of

the
commandment
that
I

The
king
said
moreover
to
Shimei,

knowest
all
the
wickedness

thine

And
O
LORD
my
thou
hast
made
thy

I
am
but
a
little
I
know
not
how
to

And
thy

Give
therefore
thy

the
speech
pleased

Solomon
had
asked

none
like

servants
shall
be

unto
thee
will
I
give
hire
for

So
Hiram
gave
Solomon
cedar
trees
and
fir
trees
according
to
all
his

And
Solomon
gave
Hiram
twenty
thousand
measures
of
wheat
for
food
to
his

king
Solomon
raised
a
levy
out

the
king
and
they
brought
great
costly

hewed
to
lay
the
foundation
of
the
1Ki5:18
And
Solomon's
builders
and
Hiram's
builders
did
hew

the
stonesquarers:
so
they
prepared

thirty

And
the
porch
before

breadth
of

ten

was
the
breadth
thereof
before
the
1Ki6:4
And
for
the
house
he
made
windows
of
narrow

And
against
the
wall
of
the
house
he
built
chambers
round
against
the
walls
of
the
house
round
both
of
the

and
of
the
and
he
made
chambers
round
1Ki6:6
The
nethermost
chamber
was
five
cubits
and
the
middle
was
six
cubits
and
the
third
was
seven
cubits
for
without
in
the
wall
of
the
house
he
made
narrowed
rests
round
that
the
beams
should
not
be
fastened
in
the
walls
of
the
hou
1Ki6:7
And
the
when
it
was
in
was
built
of
stone
made
ready
before
it
was
brought
so
that
there
was
neith
er
hammer
nor
axe
nor
any
tool
of
iron
heard
in
the
while
it
was
in
1Ki6:8
The
door
for
the
middle
chamber
was
in
the
right
side
of
the
and
they
went
up
with
winding
stairs
into
the
middle
cha
mber,
and
out
of
the
middle
into
the
1Ki6:9
So
he
built
the
and
finished
and
covered
the
house
with
beams
and
boards
of
1Ki6:10
And
then
he
built
chambers
against
all
the
five
cubits
and
they
rested
on
the
house
with
timber
of
1Ki6:11
And
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
to
1Ki6:12
Concerning
this
house
which
thou
art
in
if
thou
wilt
walk
in
my
and
execute
my
and
keep
all
my
commandments
to
walk
in
then
will
I
perform
my
word
with
which
I
spake
unto
David
thy
1Ki6:13
And
I
will
dwell
among
the
children
of
and
will
not
forsake
my
people
1Ki6:14
So
Solomon
built
the
and
finished
1Ki6:15
And
he
built
the
walls
of
the
house
within
with
boards
of
both
the
floor
of
the
and
the
walls
of
the
and
he
covered
them
on
the
inside
with
and
covered
the
floor
of
the
house
with
planks
of
1Ki6:16
And
he
built
twenty
cubits
on
the
sides
of
the
both
the
floor
and
the
walls
with
boards
of
he
even
built
them
for
it
even
for
the
even
for
the
most
holy
1Ki6:17
And
the
that
the
temple
before
was
forty
cubits
1Ki6:18
And
the
cedar
of
the
house
within
was
carved
with
knops
and
open
all
was
there
was
no
stone
1Ki6:19
And
the
oracle
he
prepared
in
the
house
to
set
there
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
1Ki6:20
And
the
oracle
in
the
forepart
was
twenty
cubits
in
and
twenty
cubits
in
and
twenty
cubits
in
the
height
t
and
he
overlaid
it
with
pure
and
so
covered
the
altar
which
was
of
1Ki6:21
So
Solomon
overlaid
the
house
within
with
pure
and
he
made
a
partition
by
the
chains
of
gold
before
the
and
h
e
overlaid
it
with
1Ki6:22
And
the
whole
house
he
overlaid
with
until
he
had
finished
all
the
also
the
whole
altar
that
was
by
the
oracle
he
overlaid
with
1Ki6:23
And
within
the
oracle
he
made
two
cherubims
of
olive
each
ten
cubits
1Ki6:24
And
five
cubits
was
the
one
wing
of
the
and
five
cubits
the
other
wing
of
the
from
the
uttermost
part
of
th
e
one
wing
unto
the
uttermost
part
of
the
other
were
ten
cubits.
1Ki6:25
And
the
other
cherub
was
ten
cubits:
both
the
cherubims
were
of
one
measure
and
one
1Ki6:26
The
height
of
the
one
cherub
was
ten
cubits,
and
so
was
it
of
the
other
1Ki6:27
And
he
set
the
cherubims
within
the
inner
and
they
stretched
forth
the
wings
of
the
cherubims,
so
that
the
wing
of
t
he
one
touched
the
one
and
the
wing
of
the
other
cherub
touched
the
other
and
their
wings
touched
one
another
in
the
mi
dst
of
the
1Ki6:28
And
he
overlaid
the
cherubims
with
1Ki6:29
And
he
carved
all
the
walls
of
the
house
round
about
with
carved
figures
of
cherubims
and
palm
trees
and
open
with
in
and
1Ki6:30
And
the
floor
of
the
house
he
overlaid
with
within
and
1Ki6:31
And
for
the
entering
of
the
oracle
he
made
doors
of
olive
the
lintel
and
side
posts
were
a
fifth
part
of
the
1Ki6:32
The
two
doors
also
were
of
olive
and
he
carved
upon
them
carvings
of
cherubims
and
palm
trees
and
open
and
o
verlaid
them
with
and
spread
gold
upon
the
cherubims,
and
upon
the
palm
1Ki6:33
So
also
made
he
for
the
door
of
the
temple
posts
of
olive
a
fourth
part
of
the
1Ki6:34
And
the
two
doors
were
of
fir
the
two
leaves
of
the
one
door
were
and
the
two
leaves
of
the
other
door
were
1Ki6:35
And
he
carved
thereon
cherubims
and
palm
trees
and
open
and
covered
them
with
gold
fitted
upon
the
carved
1Ki6:36
And
he
built
the
inner
court
with
three
rows
of
hewed
and
a
row
of
cedar
1Ki6:37
In
the
fourth
year
was
the
foundation
of
the
house
of
the
LORD
in
the
month
Zif:
1Ki6:38
And
in
the
eleventh
in
the
month
which
is
the
eighth
was
the
house
finished
throughout
all
the
parts
ther
eof,
and
according
to
all
the
fashion
of
So
was
he
seven
years
in
building
1Ki7:1
But
Solomon
was
building
his
own
house
thirteen
and
he
finished
all
his
1Ki7:2
He
built
also
the
house
of
the
forest
of
the
length
thereof
was
an
hundred
cubits,
and
the
breadth
thereof
fifty
cu
and
the
height
thereof
thirty
cubits,
upon
four
rows
of
cedar
with
cedar
beams
upon
the
1Ki7:3
And
it
was
covered
with
cedar
above
upon
the
that
lay
on
forty
five
fifteen
in
a
1Ki7:4
And
there
were
windows
in
three
and
light
was
against
light
in
three
1Ki7:5
And
all
the
doors
and
posts
were
with
the
and
light
was
against
light
in
three
1Ki7:6
And
he
made
a
porch
of
the
length
thereof
was
fifty
cubits,
and
the
breadth
thereof
thirty
cubits:
and
the
porch
wa
s
before
and
the
other
pillars
and
the
thick
beam
were
before
1Ki7:7
Then
he
made
a
porch
for
the
throne
where
he
might
even
the
porch
of
and
it
was
covered
with
cedar
from
one
side
of
the
floor
to
the
1Ki7:8
And
his
house
where
he
dwelt
had
another
court
within
the
which
was
of
the
like
Solomon
made
also
an
house
for
Pharaoh's
whom
he
had
taken
to
like
unto
this
1Ki7:9
All
these
were
of
costly
according
to
the
measures
of
hewed
sawed
with
within
and
even
from
t
he
foundation
unto
the
and
so
on
the
outside
toward
the
great
1Ki7:10
And
the
foundation
was
of
costly
even
great
stones
of
ten
cubits,
and
stones
of
eight
cubits.
1Ki7:11
And
above
were
costly
after
the
measures
of
hewed
and
cedars.
1Ki7:12
And
the
great
court
round
about
was
with
three
rows
of
hewed
and
a
row
of
cedar
both
for
the
inner
court
of
the
house
of
the
and
for
the
porch
of
the
1Ki7:13
And
king
Solomon
sent
and
fetched
Hiram
out
of
1Ki7:14
He
was
a
widow's
son
of
the
tribe
of
and
his
father
was
a
man
of
a
worker
in
and
he
was
filled
with
and
and
cunning
to
work
all
works
in
And
he
came
to
king
and
wrought
all
his
1Ki7:15
For
he
cast
two
pillars
of
of
eighteen
cubits
high
and
a
line
of
twelve
cubits
did
compass
either
of
them
ab
1Ki7:16
And
he
made
two
chapiters
of
molten
to
set
upon
the
tops
of
the
the
height
of
the
one
chapiter
was
five
cub
and
the
height
of
the
other
chapiter
was
five
cubits:
1Ki7:17
And
nets
of
checker
and
wreaths
of
chain
for
the
chapiters
which
were
upon
the
top
of
the
seven
for
th
e
one
and
seven
for
the
other
1Ki7:18
And
he
made
the
and
two
rows
round
about
upon
the
one
to
cover
the
chapiters
that
were
upon
the
with
pomegranates:
and
so
did
he
for
the
other
1Ki7:19
And
the
chapiters
that
were
upon
the
top
of
the
pillars
were
of
lily
work
in
the
four
cubits.
1Ki7:20
And
the
chapiters
upon
the
two
pillars
had
pomegranates
also
over
against
the
belly
which
was
by
the
and
th
e
pomegranates
were
two
hundred
in
rows
round
about
upon
the
other
1Ki7:21
And
he
set
up
the
pillars
in
the
porch
of
the
and
he
set
up
the
right
and
called
the
name
thereof
Jachin:
a
nd
he
set
up
the
left
and
called
the
name
thereof
1Ki7:22
And
upon
the
top
of
the
pillars
was
lily
so
was
the
work
of
the
pillars
1Ki7:23
And
he
made
a
molten
ten
cubits
from
the
one
brim
to
the
it
was
round
all
and
his
height
was
five
cubits
:
and
a
line
of
thirty
cubits
did
compass
it
round
1Ki7:24
And
under
the
brim
of
it
round
about
there
were
knops
compassing
ten
in
a
compassing
the
sea
round
the
kn
ops
were
cast
in
two
when
it
was
1Ki7:25
It
stood
upon
twelve
three
looking
toward
the
and
three
looking
toward
the
and
three
looking
toward
the
and
three
looking
toward
the
and
the
sea
was
set
above
upon
and
all
their
hinder
parts
were
1Ki7:26
And
it
was
an
hand
breadth
and
the
brim
thereof
was
wrought
like
the
brim
of
a
with
flowers
of
it
conta
ined
two
thousand
1Ki7:27
And
he
made
ten
bases
of
four
cubits
was
the
length
of
one
and
four
cubits
the
breadth
and
three
cubi
ts
the
height
of
1Ki7:28
And
the
work
of
the
bases
was
on
this
they
had
and
the
borders
were
between
the
1Ki7:29
And
on
the
borders
that
were
between
the
ledges
were
and
cherubims:
and
upon
the
ledges
there
was
a
base
above
:
and
beneath
the
lions
and
oxen
were
certain
additions
made
of
thin
1Ki7:30
And
every
base
had
four
brasen
and
plates
of
and
the
four
corners
thereof
had
undersetters:
under
the
laver
were
undersetters
at
the
side
of
every
1Ki7:31
And
the
mouth
of
it
within
the
chapiter
and
above
was
a
but
the
mouth
thereof
was
round
after
the
work
of
the
a
cubit
and
an
and
also
upon
the
mouth
of
it
were
gravings
with
their
not
1Ki7:32
And
under
the
borders
were
four
and
the
axletrees
of
the
wheels
were
joined
to
the
and
the
height
of
a
wheel
was
a
cubit
and
half
a
1Ki7:33
And
the
work
of
the
wheels
was
like
the
work
of
a
chariot
their
axletrees,
and
their
and
their
felloes,
and
t
heir
were
all
1Ki7:34
And
there
were
four
undersetters
to
the
four
corners
of
one
and
the
undersetters
were
of
the
very
base
1Ki7:35
And
in
the
top
of
the
base
was
there
a
round
compass
of
half
a
cubit
and
on
the
top
of
the
base
the
ledges
thereof
an
d
the
borders
thereof
were
of
the
1Ki7:36
For
on
the
plates
of
the
ledges
and
on
the
borders
he
graved
cherubims,
and
palm
according
to
the
proportion
of
every
and
additions
round
1Ki7:37
After
this
manner
he
made
the
ten
all
of
them
had
one
one
and
one
1Ki7:38
Then
made
he
ten
lavers
of
one
laver
contained
forty
and
every
laver
was
four
cubits:
and
upon
every
one
of
t
he
ten
bases
one
1Ki7:39
And
he
put
five
bases
on
the
right
side
of
the
and
five
on
the
left
side
of
the
and
he
set
the
sea
on
the
rig
ht
side
of
the
house
eastward
over
against
the
1Ki7:40
And
Hiram
made
the
lavers,
and
the
and
the
basons.
So
Hiram
made
an
end
of
doing
all
the
work
that
he
made
king
So

for
the
house
of

chapiters
which
were
upon

And
one
and
twelve

under

And

and
all
these

Hiram
made

In
the
plain
of
Jordan
did
the
king
cast

the
clay
ground
between
Succoth
and
Zarthan.
1Ki7:47
And
Solomon
left
all
the
vessels
because
they
were
exceeding
neither
was
the
weight
of
the
brass
found
out

1Ki7:48
And
Solomon
made

vessels
that
pertained
unto
the
house

and
the
table
of
where

So
was
ended
all
the
work
that
king
Solomon
made
for
the
house
of
the
And
Solomon
brought
in
the
things
which
David
h
is
father
had
even
the
and
the
and
the
did
he
put
among
the
treasures
of
the
house
of

1Ki8:1
Then
Solomon
assembled
the
elders
of

all
the
heads
of
the

chief
of
the
fathers
of
the
children
of

in
that
they
might
bring
up
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
LORD
out
of
the
city
of
which
is
1Ki8:2
And
all
the
men
of
Israel
assembled
themselves
unto
king
Solomon
at
the
feast
in
the
month
Ethanim,
which
is
the
seventh
mon
1Ki8:3
And
all
the
elders
of
Israel
and
the
priests
took
up
the

And
they
brought
up
the
ark
of

and
the
tabernacle
of

all
the
holy
vessels
that
were
in
the
t

even
those
did
the

And
king

unto
were
with
him
before
the
sacrificin

sheep
and
that

And
the
priests
brought

And
they

they
were

there
they
are
unto
this

There
was
nothing
in

to
when
the

court
that

that

it
came
to
when
Solomon
had
finished

building
of

house

king's
and
all

he
was
pleased

That
the
LORD
appeared
to
Solomon
the
second
as
he
had
appeared
unto
him
at

And
the
LORD
said
unto

I
have
hallowed

which
thou
hast

if
thou
wilt
walk
before
as

if

not
keep
my
commandments
and
my
statutes
which
I
have
set
before

go
and
serve

Then
will
I
cut
off
Israel
out
of

I
have
given

And
she
gave
the
king
an
hundred

twenty
talents
of

of
spices
very
great
and
precious

no

in
from
Ophir
great
plenty
of

And
the
king
made

king
Solomon
gave

Solomon
gave

Now
the
weight
of
gold
that
came
to
Solomon
in
one
year
was
six
hundred

six

Beside

king
Solomon
made
two
hundred

And
he
made

and
the
king
put
them
in

forest
of

Moreover
the
king
made
a
great
throne
of

overlaid
it
with
the
best

The
throne
had
six

the
top
of
the
throne
was
round

there
were
stays
on

place

two
lions
stood

And
twelve

stood
there
on

side
and
on
the
other
upon
the
six

not

And
all

For
the
king
had
at

navy
of

in
three
years
came
the
navy
of
Tharshish,

1Ki10:23
So
king
Solomon
exceeded
all
the
kings
of
the
earth
for
riches
and
for
1Ki10:24
And
all
the
earth
sought
to
to
hear

which
God
had
put

And
they
brought
every
man
his
vessels

and
a

by

And
Solomon
gathered
together
chariots
and
and
he
had
a
thousand
and
four
hundred
and
twelve
thousand
whom
he
bestowed
in
the
cities
for
and
with
the
king
at
1Ki10:27
And
the
king
made
silver
to
be
in
Jerusalem
as

cedars
made
he
to
be
as
the
sycomore
trees
that
are
in

vale

for

And
Solomon
had
horses
brought
out
of
and
linen
the
king's
merchants
received
the
linen
yarn
at
a

And
a
chariot
came
up
and
went
out
of
Egypt
for
six
hundred
shekels
of

an
horse
for
an
hundred
and
and
so
for
all
the
kings
of
the
Hittites,
and
for
the
kings

they
bring

out

But
king
Solomon
loved
many
strange
together
with
the
daughter
of
women
of
the
Moabites,
Edomite
s,
Zidonians,
and
Hittites;
1Ki11:2
Of
the
nations
concerning
which
the
LORD
said
unto
the
children
of
Ye
shall
not
go
in
to
neither
shall
they
c
ome
in
unto
for
surely
they
will
turn
away
your
heart
after
their
Solomon
clave
unto
these
in
1Ki11:3
And
he
had
seven
hundred
and
three
hundred
and
his
wives
turned
away
his
1Ki11:4
For
it
came
to
when
Solomon
was
that
his
wives
turned
away
his
heart
after
other
and
his
heart
was
not
per
fect
with
the
LORD
his
as
was
the
heart
of
David
his
1Ki11:5
For
Solomon
went
after
Ashtoreth
the
goddess
of
the
Zidonians,
and
after
Milcom
the
abomination
of
the
1Ki11:6
And
Solomon
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
and
went
not
fully
after
the
as
did
David
his
1Ki11:7
Then
did
Solomon
build
an
high
place
for
Chemosh,
the
abomination
of
in
the
hill
that
is
before
and
for
Mo
the
abomination
of
the
children
of
1Ki11:8
And
likewise
did
he
for
all
his
strange
which
burnt
incense
and
sacrificed
unto
their
1Ki11:9
And
the
LORD
was
angry
with
because
his
heart
was
turned
from
the
LORD
God
of
which
had
appeared
unto
him
1Ki11:10
And
had
commanded
him
concerning
this
that
he
should
not
go
after
other
but
he
kept
not
that
which
the
LORD
c
ommanded.
1Ki11:11
Wherefore
the
LORD
said
unto
Forasmuch
as
this
is
done
of
and
thou
hast
not
kept
my
covenant
and
my
statute
s,
which
I
have
commanded
I
will
surely
rend
the
kingdom
from
and
will
give
it
to
thy
1Ki11:12
Notwithstanding
in
thy
days
I
will
not
do
it
for
David
thy
father's
but
I
will
rend
it
out
of
the
hand
of
thy
1Ki11:13
Howbeit
I
will
not
rend
away
all
the
but
will
give
one
tribe
to
thy
son
for
David
my
servant's
and
for
Jeru
salem's
sake
which
I
have
1Ki11:14
And
the
LORD
stirred
up
an
adversary
unto
Hadad
the
he
was
of
the
king's
seed
in
1Ki11:15
For
it
came
to
when
David
was
in
and
Joab
the
captain
of
the
host
was
gone
up
to
bury
the
after
he
had
smitten
every
male
in
1Ki11:16
(For
six
months
did
Joab
remain
there
with
all
until
he
had
cut
off
every
male
in
Edom:)
1Ki11:17
That
Hadad
he
and
certain
Edomites
of
his
father's
servants
with
to
go
into
Hadad
being
yet
a
little
chi
ld.
1Ki11:18
And
they
arose
out
of
and
came
to
Paran:
and
they
took
men
with
them
out
of
Paran,
and
they
came
to
unto
Ph
araoh
king
of
which
gave
him
an
and
appointed
him
and
gave
him
1Ki11:19
And
Hadad
found
great
favour
in
the
sight
of
so
that
he
gave
him
to
wife
the
sister
of
his
own
the
sister
o
f
Tahpenes
the
1Ki11:20
And
the
sister
of
Tahpenes
bare
him
Genubath
his
whom
Tahpenes
weaned
in
Pharaoh's
and
Genubath
was
in
Pharaoh
's
household
among
the
sons
of
1Ki11:21
And
when
Hadad
heard
in
Egypt
that
David
slept
with
his
and
that
Joab
the
captain
of
the
host
was
Hadad
sai
d
to
Let
me
that
I
may
go
to
mine
own
1Ki11:22
Then
Pharaoh
said
unto
But
what
hast
thou
lacked
with
thou
seekest
to
go
to
thine
own
And
he
howbeit
let
me
go
in
any
1Ki11:23
And
God
stirred
him
up
another
Rezon
the
son
of
Eliadah,
which
fled
from
his
lord
Hadadezer
king
of
Zobah:
1Ki11:24
And
he
gathered
men
unto
and
became
captain
over
a
when
David
slew
them
of
Zobah:
and
they
went
to
an
d
dwelt
and
reigned
in
1Ki11:25
And
he
was
an
adversary
to
Israel
all
the
days
of
beside
the
mischief
that
Hadad
and
he
abhorred
and
reigned
over
1Ki11:26
And
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat,
an
Ephrathite
of
Zereda,
Solomon's
whose
mother's
name
was
Zeruah,
a
widow
even
he
lifted
up
his
hand
against
the
1Ki11:27
And
this
was
the
cause
that
he
lifted
up
his
hand
against
the
Solomon
built
Millo,
and
repaired
the
breaches
of
the
city
of
David
his
1Ki11:28
And
the
man
Jeroboam
was
a
mighty
man
of
and
Solomon
seeing
the
young
man
that
he
was
he
made
him
rul
er
over
all
the
charge
of
the
house
of
1Ki11:29
And
it
came
to
pass
at
that
time
when
Jeroboam
went
out
of
that
the
prophet
Ahijah
the
Shilonite
found
him
in
t
he
and
he
had
clad
himself
with
a
new
and
they
two
were
alone
in
the
1Ki11:30
And
Ahijah
caught
the
new
garment
that
was
on
and
rent
it
in
twelve
1Ki11:31
And
he
said
to
Take
thee
ten
for
thus
saith
the
the
God
of
I
will
rend
the
kingdom
out
of
the
hand
of
and
will
give
ten
tribes
to
1Ki11:32
(But
he
shall
have
one
tribe
for
my
servant
David's
and
for
Jerusalem's
the
city
which
I
have
chosen
out
of
al
l
the
tribes
of
Israel:)
1Ki11:33
Because
that
they
have
forsaken
and
have
worshipped
Ashtoreth
the
goddess
of
the
Zidonians,
Chemosh
the
god
of
the
Moa
and
Milcom
the
god
of
the
children
of
and
have
not
walked
in
my
to
do
that
which
is
right
in
mine
and
to
keep
my
statutes
and
my
as
did
David
his
1Ki11:34
Howbeit
I
will
not
take
the
whole
kingdom
out
of
his
but
I
will
make
him
prince
all
the
days
of
his
life
for
David
m
y
servant's
whom
I
because
he
kept
my
commandments
and
my
1Ki11:35
But
I
will
take
the
kingdom
out
of
his
son's
and
will
give
it
unto
even
ten
1Ki11:36
And
unto
his
son
will
I
give
one
that
David
my
servant
may
have
a
light
alway
before
me
in
the
city
whic
h
I
have
chosen
me
to
put
my
name
1Ki11:37
And
I
will
take
and
thou
shalt
reign
according
to
all
that
thy
soul
desireth,
and
shalt
be
king
over
1Ki11:38
And
it
shall
if
thou
wilt
hearken
unto
all
that
I
command
and
wilt
walk
in
my
and
do
that
is
right
in
my
s
ight,
to
keep
my
statutes
and
my
as
David
my
servant
that
I
will
be
with
and
build
thee
a
sure
as
I
built
for
and
will
give
Israel
unto
1Ki11:39
And
I
will
for
this
afflict
the
seed
of
but
not
for
1Ki11:40
Solomon
sought
therefore
to
kill
And
Jeroboam
and
fled
into
unto
Shishak
king
of
and
was
in
Egypt
until
the
death
of
1Ki11:41
And
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
and
all
that
he
and
his
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
acts
of
1Ki11:42
And
the
time
that
Solomon
reigned
in
Jerusalem
over
all
Israel
was
forty
1Ki11:43
And
Solomon
slept
with
his
and
was
buried
in
the
city
of
David
his
and
Rehoboam
his
son
reigned
in
his
st
ead.
1Ki12:1
And
Rehoboam
went
to
for
all
Israel
were
come
to
Shechem
to
make
him
1Ki12:2
And
it
came
to
when
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat,
who
was
yet
in
heard
of
(for
he
was
fled
from
the
presence
of
king
and
Jeroboam
dwelt
in
Egypt;)
1Ki12:3
That
they
sent
and
called
And
Jeroboam
and
all
the
congregation
of
Israel
and
spake
unto
1Ki12:4
Thy
father
made
our
yoke
now
therefore
make
thou
the
grievous
service
of
thy
and
his
heavy
yoke
which
he
put
upon
and
we
will
serve
1Ki12:5
And
he
said
unto
Depart
yet
for
three
then
come
again
to
And
the
people
1Ki12:6
And
king
Rehoboam
consulted
with
the
old
that
stood
before
Solomon
his
father
while
he
yet
and
How
do
ye
advise
that
I
may
answer
this
1Ki12:7
And
they
spake
unto
If
thou
wilt
be
a
servant
unto
this
people
this
and
wilt
serve
and
answer
and
speak
good
words
to
then
they
will
be
thy
servants
for
1Ki12:8
But
he
forsook
the
counsel
of
the
old
which
they
had
given
and
consulted
with
the
young
men
that
were
grown
up
wi
th
and
which
stood
before
1Ki12:9
And
he
said
unto
What
counsel
give
ye
that
we
may
answer
this
who
have
spoken
to
Make
the
yoke
wh
ich
thy
father
did
put
upon
us
1Ki12:10
And
the
young
men
that
were
grown
up
with
him
spake
unto
Thus
shalt
thou
speak
unto
this
people
that
spake
un
to
Thy
father
made
our
yoke
but
make
thou
it
lighter
unto
thus
shalt
thou
say
unto
My
little
finger
shall
be
thicker
than
my
father's
1Ki12:11
And
now
whereas
my
father
did
lade
you
with
a
heavy
I
will
add
to
your
my
father
hath
chastised
you
with
whips
,
but
I
will
chastise
you
with
1Ki12:12
So
Jeroboam
and
all
the
people
came
to
Rehoboam
the
third
as
the
king
had
Come
to
me
again
the
thi
rd
1Ki12:13
And
the
king
answered
the
people
and
forsook
the
old
men's
counsel
that
they
gave
1Ki12:14
And
spake
to
them
after
the
counsel
of
the
young
My
father
made
your
yoke
and
I
will
add
to
your
my
father
also
chastised
you
with
but
I
will
chastise
you
with
1Ki12:15
Wherefore
the
king
hearkened
not
unto
the
for
the
cause
was
from
the
that
he
might
perform
his
which
the
LORD
spake
by
Ahijah
the
Shilonite
unto
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat.
1Ki12:16
So
when
all
Israel
saw
that
the
king
hearkened
not
unto
the
people
answered
the
What
portion
have
we
i
n
neither
have
we
inheritance
in
the
son
of
to
your
O
now
see
to
thine
own
So
Israel
dep
arted
unto
their
1Ki12:17
But
as
for
the
children
of
Israel
which
dwelt
in
the
cities
of
Rehoboam
reigned
over
1Ki12:18
Then
king
Rehoboam
sent
Adoram,
who
was
over
the
and
all
Israel
stoned
him
with
that
he
Therefore
k
ing
Rehoboam
made
speed
to
get
him
up
to
his
to
flee
to
1Ki12:19
So
Israel
rebelled
against
the
house
of
David
unto
this
1Ki12:20
And
it
came
to
when
all
Israel
heard
that
Jeroboam
was
come
that
they
sent
and
called
him
unto
the
congregati
and
made
him
king
over
all
there
was
none
that
followed
the
house
of
but
the
tribe
of
Judah
1Ki12:21
And
when
Rehoboam
was
come
to
he
assembled
all
the
house
of
with
the
tribe
of
an
hundred
and
f
ourscore
thousand
chosen
which
were
to
fight
against
the
house
of

twentieth
year
of
Jeroboam
king
of
Israel
reigned
Asa
over

And
forty
and
one
years
reigned
he
in
And
his
mother's
name
was
Maachah,
the
daughter
of
Abishalom.
1Ki15:11
And
Asa
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
eyes
of
the
as
did
David
his
1Ki15:12
And
he
took
away
the
sodomites
out
of
the
and
removed
all
the
idols
that
his
fathers
had
1Ki15:13
And
also
Maachah
his
even
her
he
removed
from
being
because
she
had
made
an
idol
in
a
and
Asa
destro
yed
her
and
burnt
it
by
the
brook
1Ki15:14
But
the
high
places
were
not
nevertheless
Asa's
heart
was
perfect
with
the
LORD
all
his
1Ki15:15
And
he
brought
in
the
things
which
his
father
had
and
the
things
which
himself
had
into
the
house
of
the
and
and
1Ki15:16
And
there
was
war
between
Asa
and
Baasha
king
of
Israel
all
their
1Ki15:17
And
Baasha
king
of
Israel
went
up
against
and
built
Ramah,
that
he
might
not
suffer
any
to
go
out
or
come
in
to
Asa
king
of
1Ki15:18
Then
Asa
took
all
the
silver
and
the
gold
that
were
left
in
the
treasures
of
the
house
of
the
and
the
treasures
of
t

king's
and
delivered
them
into
the
hand
of
his
and
king
Asa
sent
them
to
Benhadad,
the
son
of
Tabrimon,
the
son
of
Hezion,
king
of
that
dwelt
at
1Ki15:19
There
is
a
league
between
me
and
and
between
my
father
and
thy
I
have
sent
unto
thee
a
present
of
si
lver
and
come
and
break
thy
league
with
Baasha
king
of
that
he
may
depart
from
1Ki15:20
So
Benhadad
hearkened
unto
king
Asa,
and
sent
the
captains
of
the
hosts
which
he
had
against
the
cities
of
and
smo
te
Ijon,
and
and
Abelbethmaachah,
and
all
Cinneroth,
with
all
the
land
of

And
it
came
to
when
Baasha
heard
that
he
left
off
building
of
Ramah,
and
dwelt
in
Tirzah.
1Ki15:22
Then
king
Asa
made
a
proclamation
throughout
all
none
was
and
they
took
away
the
stones
of
Ramah,
and
the
timber
wherewith
Baasha
had
and
king
Asa
built
with
them
Geba
of
and
Mizpah.

The

Nevertheless
in

age
he
was

And
Asa

his
fathers
in

And
Nadab
the

reign
over
Israel
in
the
second
year
of
Asa
king
of

reigned
over
Israel

And
he
did
evil
in
the
sight

and
walked
in

and
in

sin
wherewith
he
made
Israel

And
Baasha
the

Baasha
smote
him
at
Gibbethon,
which
be

all
Israel
laid

Even
in

third
year
of
Asa
king
of
Judah
did
Baasha
slay
and
reigned
in

And
it
came

when

any

until
he
had
destroyed
according
unto
the
saying
of
the
which
he
spake
by
his
servant
Ahijah
the
Shilonite:
1Ki15:30
Because
of
the
sins
of
Jeroboam
which
he
and
which
he
made
Israel
by
his
provocation
wherewith
he
provoked
th

LORD
God
of

In

third

began
Baasha
the
son
of
Ahijah
to

over
all
Israel
in
Tirzah,
twenty
and
four
1Ki15:34
And
he
did
evil

and
walked
in
the
way
of
and
in
his
sin
wherewith
he
made
Israel

1Ki16:1
Then
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
to
Jehu
the
son
of
Hanani
against
Baasha,
1Ki16:2
Forasmuch
as
I
exalted
thee
out
of
the
and
made
thee
prince
over
my
people
and
thou
hast
walked
in
the
way
of
and
hast
made
my
people
Israel
to
to
provoke
me
to
anger
with
their
1Ki16:3
I
will
take
away
the
posterity
of
Baasha,
and
the
posterity
of
his
and
will
make
thy
house
like
the
house
of
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat.
1Ki16:4
Him
that

him
that
dieth
of
his
in

Baasha
slept

was
buried
in
Tirzah:
and
Elah
his
son
reigned
in

And
also
by
the
hand
of
the
prophet
Jehu
the
son
of
Hanani
came
the
word
of
the
LORD
against
Baasha,
and
against
his
even
for
all
the
evil
that
he
did
in
the
sight
of

him
to

with
the

In

Elah
the

Israel
in

And
his
servant
Zimri,
captain
of
half

he
was
in
Tirzah,
drinking
himself
drunk
in
the
house
of
Arza
steward
of
his
house
in
Tirzah.
1Ki16:10
And
Zimri
went
in
and
smote
and
killed
in
the
twenty
and
seventh
year
of
Asa
king
of
and
reigned
in
his
s

1Ki16:11
And
it
came
to
when
he
began
to
as
soon
as
he
sat
on

he
slew
all

not

that
pisseth
against

Thus
did
Zimri
destroy
all
the
house
of
Baasha,
according
to
the
word
of
the
which
he
spake
against
Baasha
by
Jehu

For
all

which
they
made

In

seven
days
in
Tirzah.
And
the
people
were

went
up
from
Gibbethon,

1Ki16:18
And
it
came
to
when
Zimri
saw
that

palace
of
the
king's

burnt

But
the

Omri
prevailed
against

In

And

But
Omri
wrought
evil
in
the
eyes
of
the
and
did
worse
than
all
that
were
before
1Ki16:26
For
he
walked
in
all
the
way
of
Jeroboam
the
son
of

in

sin
wherewith
he
made
Israel

So

Ahab
the

did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the

above
all
that
were

And
it
came
to
as
if
it

And
he
reared
up

for
Baal
in

And
Ahab
made

Ahab
did
more

In

Get

And

So
he
went

flesh
in

bread

he
drank
of

And
it
came
to

after
a
that
the
brook
dried
because
there
had
been
no

commanded
a
widow
woman
there

So
he

And
when

And
Elijah
said
unto

thereof
a

For
thus

out

carried
him
up
into

laid
him
upon

And
he
cried
unto

thou
also
brought
evil
upon

widow
with

And
he
stretched
himself
upon

cried
unto
the

O
LORD

pray
let

And
the

child
came
into

that
the
word

And
it
came
to

after
many
that

And
Ahab
called

Obadiah
feared

For
it
was
when
Jezebel

Obadiah
took

hid
them
by
fifty

And
he
answered
I
tell
thy

And
he
What
have
I
that
thou
wouldest
deliver
thy
servant
into
the
hand
of

1Ki18:10
As
the
LORD
thy
God
there
is
no

whither
my
lord
hath
not
sent
to

when

He

took
an
oath

And
now
thou
sayest,
tell
thy

And
it
shall
come
to

soon
as
I
am
gone
from

and
so
when
I

when
Jezebel

Elijah
As

So
Obadiah
went
to
meet

told
and
Ahab
went
to
meet
1Ki18:17
And
it
came
to
when
Ahab
saw
that
Ahab
said
unto
Art

And
he
I
have
not

1Ki18:19
Now
therefore
and
gather

me
all
Israel

of
Baal
four
hundred

So
Ahab
sent
unto
all
the
children

gathered
the

together
unto

And
Elijah
came
unto
all

How

And
the
people
answered
him
not

Then
said
Elijah
unto
the

Baal's
prophets
are

1Ki18:23
Let
them
therefore
give
us
two
bullocks;
and
let
them
choose
one
bullock
for

cut
it
in

lay
it
on

put
no

I
will
dress

And
call
ye
on

I
will
call

the
God
that
answereth
by

And
all
the
people
answered
and
It
is
well
1Ki18:25
And
Elijah
said
unto
the
prophets
of
Choose
you
one
bullock
for

dress
it
for
ye
are

call
on
the
name
of
your
but
put
no

1Ki18:26
And
they
took
the
bullock
which
was
given
and
they
dressed
and
called
on
the
name
of
Baal
from
morning
even
unti

But
there
was
no

And
they
leaped
upon
the
altar

And
it
came
to

at
that
Elijah
mocked
and
Cry
for

And
they
cried
and
cut
themselves
after
their
manner
with
knives
and
lancets,
till
the
blood
gushed
out
upon

And
it
came
to
when

Elijah
took

word
of

shall
be

And
with
the
stones
he
built
an
altar
in
the
name
of

he
made
a
trench
about

And
he
put

Fill

And
Naboth
said
to

And
Ahab
came
into

And
Ahab
said
to

hath
sent

to
And
Elisha
said
unto
As
the
LORD
and
as
thy
soul
I
will
not
leave
So
they
went
down
to
2Ki2:3
And
the
sons
of
the
prophets
that
were
at
Bethel
came
forth
to
and
said
unto

they
came
to

they
two
went

And
fifty
men
of
the
sons
of
the
prophets
and
stood
to
view
afar
and
they
two
stood
by

And
Elijah
took
his

wrapped
it
and
smote
the
and
they
were
divided
hither
and
so
that
they
two
went
over
on
dry
2Ki2:9
And
it
came
to
when
they
were
gone
that
Elijah
said
unto
Ask
what
I
shall
do
for
before
I
be
taken
away
from
And
Elisha
I
pray
let
a
double
portion
of
thy
spirit
be

And
he
Thou
hast
asked
a

I
am
taken

shall
be
so
unto
thee

but
if
it
shall
not
be

And
it
came
to
as
they
still
went
and
there
appeared
a
chariot
of
and
horses
of

parted
them
both
and
Elijah
went
up
by
a
whirlwind
into
2Ki2:12
And
Elisha
saw
and
he
My
my
the
chariot
of
and
the
horsemen
And
he
saw
him
no

and
he
took
hold
of
his
own

rent
them
in
two
2Ki2:13
He
took
up
also
the
mantle
of
Elijah
that
fell
from
and
went
and
stood
by
the
bank
of
2Ki2:14
And
he
took

parted
hither
and
and
Elisha
went
2Ki2:15
And
when
the
sons
of
the
prophets
which
were
to
view
at
Jericho
saw
they
The
spirit
of
Elijah
doth
rest
on
Elish
And
they
came
to
meet
and
bowed
themselves
to
the
ground
before
2Ki2:16
And
they
said
unto
Behold
there
be
with
thy
servants
fifty
strong
let
them
we
pray
and
seek
thy
ma
ster:
lest
peradventure
the
Spirit
of
the
LORD
hath
taken
him
and
cast
him
upon
some
or
into
some
And
he
said
,
Ye
shall

And
when
they
urged
him
till
he
was
he
They
sent
therefore
fifty
and
they
sought
three
but
found
him
2Ki2:18
And
when
they
came
again
to
(for
he
tarried
at
Jericho,)
he
said
unto
Did
I
not
say
unto
Go
2Ki2:19
And
the
men
of
the
city
said
unto
I
pray
the
situation
of
this
city
is
as
my
lord
seeth:
bu
t
the
water
is

the
ground
2Ki2:20
And
he
Bring
me
a
new
and
put
salt
And
they
brought
it
to
2Ki2:21
And
he
went
forth
unto
the
spring
of
the
and
cast
the
salt
in
and
Thus
saith
the
I
have
healed

be

thence

more
death
or
barren
2Ki2:22
So
the
waters
were
healed
unto
this
according
to
the
saying
of
Elisha
which
he
2Ki2:23
And
he
went
up
from
thence
unto
and
as
he
was
going
up
by
the
there
came
forth
little
children
out
of
the
city
,
and
mocked
and
said
unto
Go
thou
bald
go
thou
bald
2Ki2:24
And
he
turned
and
looked
on
and
cursed
them
in
the
name
of

And
there
came
forth
two

bears
out
of
the

forty
and
two
children
of

And
he
went
from
thence
to
mount
and
from
thence
he
returned
to
2Ki3:1
Now
Jehoram
the
son
of
Ahab
began
to
reign
over
Israel
in
Samaria
the
eighteenth
year
of
Jehoshaphat
king
of

reig
ned
twelve
2Ki3:2
And
he
wrought
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
but
not
like
his
and
like
his
for
he
put
away
the
image
of
Baa
l
that
his
father
had
2Ki3:3
Nevertheless
he
cleaved
unto
the
sins
of
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat,
which
made
Israel
to
he
departed
not
2Ki3:4
And
Mesha
king
of
Moab
was
a
sheepmaster,
and
rendered
unto
the
king
of
Israel
an
hundred
thousand
and
an
hundred
tho
usand
with
the
2Ki3:5
But
it
came
to
when
Ahab
was
that
the
king
of
Moab
rebelled
against
the
king
of
2Ki3:6
And
king
Jehoram
went
out
of
Samaria
the
same
and
numbered
all
2Ki3:7
And
he
went
and
sent
to
Jehoshaphat
the
king
of
The
king
of
Moab

rebelled
against

thou
go
with
me
against
Moab
to
And
he
I
will
go
I
am
as
thou
my
people
as
thy
and
my
horses
as
thy
2Ki3:8
And
he
Which
way
shall
we
go
And
he
The
way
through
the
wilderness
of
2Ki3:9
So
the
king
of
Israel
and
the
king
of
and
the
king
of
and
they
fetched
a
compass
of
seven
and
there
was
no
water
for
the
and
for
the
cattle
that
followed

And
the
king
of
Israel
that
the
LORD
hath
called
these
three
kings
to
deliver
them
into

hand
of

2Ki3:11
But
Jehoshaphat
Is
there
not
here
a
prophet
of
the
that
we
may
enquire
of
the
LORD
by
And
one
of
the
king
of
Israel's
servants
answered
and
Here
is
Elisha
the
son
of
Shaphat,
which
poured
water
on
the
hands
of

And
Jehoshaphat
The
word

LORD

So
the
king
of
Israel
and
Jehoshaphat
and
the
king
of
Edom
went
dow

Elisha
said
unto
the
king

presence
of

it
came
to
when
the
minstrel
that
the
hand
of
the
LORD
came

saith
the

thus
saith
the

ye
see
yet
that
valley
shall
be
filled
with

ye
may

your

And
this
is
but
a
light
thing
in
the
sight
of
the
he
will
deliver
the
Moabites
also
into
your

And
ye
shall
smite
every

shall
fell

stop

it
came
to

by
the
way
of

the
country
was
filled

when
all
the
Moabites
heard
that
the
kings
were
come
up
to
fight
against

gathered
all
that
were
able
to
put

they
rose
up
early
in

shone
upon

the
Moabites
saw

And
when
they
came
to
the
camp
of
the
Israelites
rose
up
and
smote
the
Moabites,
so
that
they
fled
before
but
they
went
forward
smiting
the
Moabites,
even
in

And
they
beat
down

And
one
went

told

And
the
king
of
Syria
Go

I
will
send

he
and
took
with
him
ten
talents
of

six
thousand
pieces
of

ten
changes

he
brought

Now
when
this
letter
is
come
unto
I
have
therewith
se

Naaman
my
servant
to
that
thou
mayest
recover
him
of

And
it
came
to
when
the
king
of
Israel
had
read
the

he
rent
his
and
Am
I
to
kill
and
to
make

this
man
doth
send
unto
me
to
recover
a
man
of
his
wherefore
I
pray
and
see
how
he
seek
eth
a
quarrel
against
2Ki5:8
And
it
was
when
Elisha
the
man
of
God
had
heard
that
the
king
of
Israel
had
rent
his
that
he
sent
to
the
Wherefore
hast
thou
rent
thy

him
come
now
to

he
shall
know
that
there
is
a
prophet
in

So
Naaman
came
with
his
horses
and
with
his
and
stood
at
the
door
of
the
house
of
2Ki5:10
And
Elisha
sent
a
messenger
unto
Go
and
wash
in
Jordan

and
thy
flesh
shall
come
again
to

thou
shalt

But
Naaman
was
and
went
and
I
He
will
surely
come
out
to

and
call
on
the
name
of
the
LORD

and
strike
his
hand
over

and
recover

Are
not

and
Pharpar,
rivers

So
he
turned
and
went
away
in
a
2Ki5:13
And
his
servants
came
and
spake
unto
and
My
if
the
prophet
had
bid
thee
do
some
great
would
est
thou
not
have
done
how
much
rather
when
he
saith
to

Then
went
he
and
dipped
himself
seven
times
in
according
to
the
saying
of
the
man
of
and
his
flesh
came
again
like
unto
the
flesh
of
a
little
and
he
was
2Ki5:15
And
he
returned
to
the
man
of

and
all
his
and
and
stood
before
and
he
now
I
know
that
there
is
no
God
in
all

but
in
now
I
pray
take
a
blessing
of

But
he
As

urged
him

In
this

my
master
goeth
into
the
house
of
Rimmon
to
worship

he

on

I
bow
myself
in
the
house
of
Rimmon:
when
I
bow
down
myself
in
the
house
of
Rimmon,
the
LORD
pardon
thy
servant
in
this
2Ki5:19
And
he
said
unto
Go
in
So
he
departed
from
him
a
little
2Ki5:20
But
Gehazi,
the
servant
of
Elisha
the
man
of
my
master
hath
spared
Naaman
this
in
not
receiving

his
hands

he
as
the
LORD
I
will
run
after

take
somewhat

So
Gehazi
followed
after
Naaman.
And
when
Naaman

running
after

lighted
down
from

Elisha
said
unto

And
he
Thy

And
he
said
unto

he
went
out
from

the
sons

Therefore
the
heart

And
there
was
a
great
famine
in

And
as
the

cried
a
woman
unto
my
O

And
he
If

And
the

said

This
woman
said
unto

So
we
boiled

I
said
unto
her
on
the
next
Give
thy

And
it
came
to
when
the
king
heard
the
words
of
the
that
he
rent
his

he
passed
by
upon

more
also

But
Elisha
sat

the
king
sent

And
while
he
yet
talked
with

came
down
unto

he
this
evil
is
of
the
what
should

Then
Elisha
Hear

Thus
saith

Then
a
lord
on
whose
hand
the
king
leaned
answered
the
man

And
there
were
four
leprous
men
at
the
entering
in

they
said
one
to

Now
therefore

2Ki7:5
And
they
rose
up
in
the
to
go
unto
the
camp
of

and
when
they
were
come
to
the
uttermost
part
of

was
no

For
the
LORD
had
made
the
host
of
the
Syrians
to
hear
a
noise
of

a
noise
of
even
the
noise
of
a

they
said
one
to
the
king
of
Israel

hired
against
us
the
kings
of
the
Hittites,
and
the
kings
of

Wherefore
they
arose
and
fled
in

left

the
camp
as

fled
for

And
when
these
lepers
came
to
the
uttermost

went
into

Then
they
said
one
to

So
they
came
and
called
unto
the
porter
of

they
told

called

king's
house
2Ki7:12
And
the
king
arose
in

And
one
of
his
servants
answered
and
Let

They
took
therefore

the
king
sent

And
it
came
to

as
the

And
so
it
fell

Then
spake
Elisha
unto

2Ki8:3
And
it
came
to
pass
at
the
seven
that
the
woman
returned
out
of

land
of

and
she
went
forth
to
cry
unto
the
king
for
her
house
and
for

2Ki8:4
And
the
king
talked
with
Gehazi
the
servant
of
the
man
of

pray
all
the
great
things
that

And
it
came
to
as
he
was
telling
the
king
how
he
had
restored
a
dead

whose
son
he

And
Gehazi
My
O
this
is

this
is

Elisha
restored

And
when
the
king
asked
the

told
So
the
king
appointed
unto
her

And
Elisha
came
to

Benhadad
the
king
of
Syria
was

it
was
told
The

2Ki8:8
And
the
king
said
unto
Hazael,
Take

meet
the
man
of

enquire
of

So
Hazael
went
to
meet
and
took
a
present
with
even
of
every
good
thing
of
forty
and
cam

and
stood
before
and
Thy
son
Benhadad
king
of
Syria
hath
sent

And
Elisha
said
unto

unto
Thou

And
he
settled
his
countenance
stedfastly,
until
he
was

the
man
of
God
2Ki8:12
And
Hazael
Why

Because
I
know
the
evil
that
thou
wilt
do
unto
the
children
of
Israe

their
strong

wilt
thou
set
on

their
young
men
wilt
thou
slay

And
Hazael
But

Elisha

So
he
departed
from

came
to
his

said
to
What
said
Elisha
to
And
he
He
told
me
that
thou

And
it
came
to

on

Thirty

two
years
old
was
he
when
he
began
to

he
reigned
eight
years
in

And
he
walked
in
the
way
of

In
his
days
Edom
revolted
from

the
hand
of

made
a
king
over

So
Joram
went
over
to
Zair,
and
all
the
chariots
with

he
rose
by
and
smote
the
Edomites
which
compassed
him

the
people
fled
into

Edom
revolted

In

Ahaziah
the
son
of

he
walked
in
the
way
of
the
house
of

did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
as
did
the
house
of

he
was
the
son
in
law
of
the
house

And
he
went
with
Joram
the
son
of
Ahab
to
the
war
against
Hazael
king
of
Syria
in
Ramothgilead;
and
the
Syrians
wounded

And
king
Joram
went
back
to
be

of
the
wounds
which
the
Syrians
had
given

at
Ramah,
when

Ahaziah
the

went
down
to

And
Elisha
the
prophet
called

said
unto
Gird
up
thy

take
this
box
o

in
thine

2Ki9:2
And
when
thou
comest
look
out
there
Jehu
the
son
of
Jehoshaphat
the
son
of
Nimshi,
and
go
and
make
him
arise
up
from
among
his
and
carry
him
to

Then
take
the
box
of

pour
it
on
his
and
Thus
saith

I
have
anointed
thee
king
over
Then
open

and
tarry

So
the
young
even
the
young
man

went
to
Ramothgilead.

And
when

And
he
and
went
into

and
he
poured

said
unto
Thus

the
LORD

have
anointed
thee
king
over

And
thou
shalt
smite
the
house
of
Ahab

that
I
may
avenge
the
blood
of
my
servants

and
the
blood
of
all
the
servants
of

hand
of

For
the
whole

will
cut
off
from
Ahab
him
that
pisseth
against
the
and
him
that
is
sh
ut
up
and
left
in
2Ki9:9
And
I
will
make
the
house
of
Ahab
like
the
house
of
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat,
and
like

And
the
dogs
shall
eat
Jezebel
in
the
portion
of

there
shall
be
none
to

And
he
opened
the
and
2Ki9:11
Then
Jehu
came
forth
to
the
servants
of
his
and
one
said
unto
Is
all
wherefore
came
this
mad
fellow
to
the

And
he
said
unto
Ye
know
the
and
his
2Ki9:12
And
they
It
is
tell
us
And
he
Thus
and
thus
spake
he
to
Thus
saith
the
I
have
ano
inted
thee
king
over

Then
they
and
took
every
man

and
put
it
under
him
on
the
top
of
the
and
blew
with
sa

2Ki9:14
So
Jehu
the
son
of
Jehoshaphat
the
son
of
Nimshi
conspired
against
Joram.
(Now
Joram
had
kept
Ramothgilead,
he
and
all
Isra
because
of
Hazael
king
of
2Ki9:15
But
king
Joram
was
returned
to
be
healed
in
Jezreel
of
the
wounds
which
the
Syrians
had
given
when
he
fought
with
Haza
el
king
of
Syria.)
And
Jehu
If
it
be
your
then
let
none
go
forth
nor
escape
out
of
the
city
to
go
to
tell
it
in
Jezree

2Ki9:16
So
Jehu
rode
in
a
and
went
to
for
Joram
lay
And
Ahaziah
king
of
Judah
was
come
down
to
see
Joram.
2Ki9:17
And
there
stood
a
watchman
on
the
tower
in
and
he
spied
the
company
of
Jehu

And
Joram
Take
an

send
to
meet
and
let

So
there
went
one
on
horseback
to
meet
and
Thus
saith
the
Is
it
And
Jehu
What
hast
thou
to
do
with
turn
thee
behind
And
the
watchman
The
messenger
came
to
but
he
cometh
not
2Ki9:19
Then
he
sent
out
a
second
on
which
came
to
and
Thus
saith
the
Is

And
Jehu
What
hast
thou
to
do
with
turn
thee
behind
2Ki9:20
And
the
watchman
He
came
even
unto
and
cometh
not
and
the
driving
is
like
the
driving
of
Jehu

And
Joram
Make
And
his
chariot
was
made
And
Joram
king
of
Israel
and
Ahaziah
king
of
Judah
went
ea

they
went
out
against

met
him
in

so
it

Then
one
of
the

they
had

dwelt
in

taught
them
how
they
should

Howbeit
every
nation
made

the
Samaritans
had
every

they
feared

evil
than

So
Saul
died
for
his
transgression
which
he
committed
against
the
even
against
the
word
of
the
which
he
kept
and
also
for
asking
counsel
of
one
that
had
a
familiar
to
enquire
of
1Chr10:14
And
enquired
not
of
the
therefore
he
slew
and
turned
the
kingdom
unto
David
the
son
of
1Chr11:1
Then
all
Israel
gathered
themselves
to
David
unto
we
are
thy
bone
and
thy
1Chr11:2
And
moreover
in
time
even
when
Saul
was
thou
wast
he
that
leddest
out
and
broughtest
in
and
the
LORD
t
hy
God
said
unto
Thou
shalt
feed
my
people
and
thou
shalt
be
ruler
over
my
people
1Chr11:3
Therefore
came
all
the
elders
of
Israel
to
the
king
to
and
David
made
a
covenant
with
them
in
Hebron
before
the
LO
and
they
anointed
David
king
over
according
to
the
word
of
the
LORD
by
1Chr11:4
And
David
and
all
Israel
went
to
which
is
Jebus;
where
the
Jebusites
the
inhabitants
of
the
1Chr11:5
And
the
inhabitants
of
Jebus
said
to
Thou
shalt
not
come
Nevertheless
David
took
the
castle
of
which
is
the
city
of
1Chr11:6
And
David
Whosoever
smiteth
the
Jebusites
first
shall
be
chief
and
So
Joab
the
son
of
Zeruiah
went
first
up
,
and
was
1Chr11:7
And
David
dwelt
in
the
therefore
they
called
it
the
city
of
1Chr11:8
And
he
built
the
city
round
even
from
Millo
round
and
Joab
repaired
the
rest
of
the
1Chr11:9
So
David
waxed
greater
and
for
the
LORD
of
hosts
was
with
1Chr11:10
These
also
are
the
chief
of
the
mighty
men
whom
David
who
strengthened
themselves
with
him
in
his
and
with
all
to
make
him
according
to
the
word
of
the
LORD
concerning
1Chr11:11
And
this
is
the
number
of
the
mighty
men
whom
David
Jashobeam,
an
Hachmonite,
the
chief
of
the
he
lifted
u
p
his
spear
against
three
hundred
slain
by
him
at
one
1Chr11:12
And
after
him
was
Eleazar
the
son
of
the
Ahohite,
who
was
one
of
the
three
mighties.
1Chr11:13
He
was
with
David
at
Pasdammim,
and
there
the
Philistines
were
gathered
together
to
where
was
a
parcel
of
ground
full
of
and
the
people
fled
from
before
the
1Chr11:14
And
they
set
themselves
in
the
midst
of
that
and
delivered
and
slew
the
and
the
LORD
saved
them
by
a
great
1Chr11:15
Now
three
of
the
thirty
captains
went
down
to
the
rock
to
into
the
cave
of
Adullam;
and
the
host
of
the
Philistine
s
encamped
in
the
valley
of
Rephaim.
1Chr11:16
And
David
was
then
in
the
and
the
garrison
was
then
at
1Chr11:17
And
David
and
Oh
that
one
would
give
me
drink
of
the
water
of
the
well
of
that
is
at
the
1Chr11:18
And
the
three
brake
through
the
host
of
the
and
drew
water
out
of
the
well
of
that
was
by
the
gat

and
took
and
brought
it
to
but
David
would
not
drink
of
but
poured
it
out
to
the
1Chr11:19
And
My
God
forbid
it
that
I
should
do
this
shall
I
drink
the
blood
of
these
men
that
have
put
their
live
s
in
for
with
the
jeopardy
of

brought
Therefore

Moreover
they
that

And
David
consulted
with
the
captains

and
with

And
David
said
unto
all
the
congregation
of
If

that
it
be
of
the
LORD
our
let

s
end
abroad
unto

of
and
with

also
to
the
priests
and
Levites
wh
ich
are
in
their
cities
and
that
they
may
gather
themselves
unto
1Chr13:3
And
let
us
bring
again
the
ark
of
our
God
to
for
we
enquired
not
at
it
in
the
days
of
1Chr13:4
And
all
the
congregation
said
that
they
would
do
for
the
thing
was
right
in
the
eyes
of
all
the
1Chr13:5
So
David
gathered
all
Israel
from
Shihor
of
Egypt
even
unto
the
entering
of
Hemath,
to
bring
the
ark
of
God
from
Kirjathjearim.
1Chr13:6
And
David
went
and
all
to
Baalah,
that
to
Kirjathjearim,
which
belonged
to
to
bring
up
thence
the

of
God
the
that
dwelleth
between
the
cherubims,
whose
name
is
called
on

And
they
carried
the
ark
of
God
in
a
new
cart
out
of
the
house
of
Abinadab:
and
Uzza
and
Ahio
drave

And
David
and
all
Israel
played
before
God
with
all
their
and
with
and
with
and
with
psalteries,
an
d
with
timbrels,
and
with
and
with

And
when
they
came
unto
the
threshingfloor
of
Chidon,
Uzza
put
forth
his
hand
to
hold
the

the
oxen
1Chr13:10
And
the
anger
of
the
LORD
was
kindled
against
Uzza,
and
he
smote
because
he
put
his
hand
to
the
and
there
he
di
ed
before

And
David
was
because
the
LORD
had
made
a
breach
upon
Uzza:
wherefore
that
place
is
called
Perezuzza
to
this
1Chr13:12
And
David
was
afraid
of
God
that
How
shall
I
bring
the
ark
of
God
home
to

So
David
brought
not
the
ark
home
to
himself
to
the
city
of
but
carried
it
aside
into
the
house
of
Obededom

And
the
ark
of
God
remained

of
Obededom
in

And

blessed
the
house
of

Philistines
heard
that
David
was
anointed
king
over
all
all
the
Philistines
went
up
to
seek
An
d
David
heard
of
and
went
out
against
1Chr14:9
And
the
Philistines
came
and
spread
themselves
in
the
valley
of
Rephaim.
1Chr14:10
And
David
enquired
of
Shall
I
go
up
against
the
And
wilt
thou
deliver
them
into
mine
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Go
for
I
will
deliver
them
into
thine
1Chr14:11
So
they
came
up
to
Baalperazim;
and
David
smote
them
Then
David
God
hath
broken
in
upon
mine
enemies
by
mine
hand
like
the
breaking
forth
of
therefore
they
called
the
name
of
that
place
Baalperazim.
1Chr14:12
And
when
they
had
left
their
gods
David
gave
a
and
they
were
burned
with
1Chr14:13
And
the
Philistines
yet
again
spread
themselves
abroad
in
the
1Chr14:14
Therefore
David
enquired
again
of
and
God
said
unto
Go
not
up
after
turn
away
from
and
come
upon
th
em
over
against
the
mulberry
1Chr14:15
And
it
shall
when
thou
shalt
hear
a
sound
of
going
in
the
tops
of
the
mulberry
that
then
thou
shalt
go
out
to
for
God
is
gone
forth
before
thee
to
smite
the
host
of
the
1Chr14:16
David
therefore
did
as
God
commanded
and
they
smote
the
host
of
the
Philistines
from
Gibeon
even
to
1Chr14:17
And
the
fame
of
David
went
out
into
all
and
the
LORD
brought
the
fear
of
him
upon
all
1Chr15:1
And
David
made
him
houses
in
the
city
of
and
prepared
a
place
for
the
ark
of
and
pitched
for
it
a
1Chr15:2
Then
David
None
ought
to
carry
the
ark
of
God
but
the
Levites:
for
them
hath
the
LORD
chosen
to
carry
the
ark
of
God
,
and
to
minister
unto
him
for
1Chr15:3
And
David
gathered
all
Israel
together
to
to
bring
up
the
ark
of
the
LORD
unto
his
which
he
had
prepared
for
1Chr15:4
And
David
assembled
the
children
of
and
the
Levites:
1Chr15:5
Of
the
sons
of
Kohath;
Uriel
the
and
his
brethren
an
hundred
and
1Chr15:6
Of
the
sons
of
Merari;
Asaiah
the
and
his
brethren
two
hundred
and
1Chr15:7
Of
the

Of
the
sons
of
Uzziel;
Amminadab
the
and
his
brethren
an
hundred
and
1Chr15:11
And
David
called
for
Zadok
and
Abiathar
the
and
for
the
Levites,
for
Asaiah,
and
Shemaiah,
and
Elie
l,
and
Amminadab,
1Chr15:12
And
said
unto
Ye
are
the
chief
of
the
fathers
of
the
Levites:
sanctify
both
ye
and
your
that
ye
may
bring
up
the
ark
of
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
unto
the
place
that
I
have
prepared
for
1Chr15:13
For
because
ye
did
it
not
at
the
the
LORD
our
God
made
a
breach
upon
for
that
we
sought
him
not
after
the
due
1Chr15:14
So
the
priests
and
the
Levites
sanctified
themselves
to
bring
up
the
ark
of
the
LORD
God
of
1Chr15:15
And
the
children
of
the
Levites
bare
the
ark
of
God
upon
their
shoulders
with
the
staves
as
Moses
commanded
acco
rding
to
the
word
of
the
1Chr15:16
And
David
spake
to
the
chief
of
the
Levites
to
appoint
their
brethren
to
be
the
singers
with
instruments
of
musick,
psalt
eries
and
harps
and
by
lifting
up
the
voice
with
1Chr15:17
So
the
Levites
appointed
Heman
the
son
of
and
of
his
Asaph
the
son
of
Berechiah;
and
of
the
sons
of
Merar
i
their

the
son
of
Kushaiah;
1Chr15:18
And
with
them
their
brethren
of
the

and
Mikneiah,
and

and
Jeiel,

1Chr15:19
So
the
Heman,
Asaph,
and
were
appointed
to
sound
with
cymbals
of

And

and
Mikneiah,
and
Obededom,
and
Jeiel,
and
Azaziah,
with
harps
on
the
Sheminith
to
1Chr15:22
And
Chenaniah,
chief
of
the
Levites,
was
for
he
instructed
about
the
because
he
was
1Chr15:23
And
Berechiah
and
Elkanah
were
doorkeepers
for
the
1Chr15:24
And
Shebaniah,
and
and
Nethaneel,
and
Amasai,

and
Benaiah,
and
Eliezer,
the
did
blow
with
the
trumpets
before
the
ark
of
and
Obededom
and
Jehiah
were
doorkeepers
for
the
1Chr15:25
So
and
the
elders
of
and
the
captains
over
went
to
bring
up
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
LORD
out
of
the
house
of
Obededom
with
1Chr15:26
And
it
came
to
when
God
helped
the
Levites
that
bare
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
that
they
offered
seven
b
ullocks
and
seven

And
David
was
clothed
with
a
robe
of
fine

all
the

that
bare

Chenaniah
th
e
master
of
the
song
with
the
David
also
had
upon
him
an
ephod
of
1Chr15:28
Thus
all
Israel
brought
up
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
LORD
with
and
with
sound
of
the
and
with
trum
and
with
making
a
noise
with
psalteries
and
1Chr15:29
And
it
came
to
as
the
ark

the
covenant
of
the
LORD
came
to
the
city
of
that
Michal,
the
daughter
of
Saul
looking
out
at
a
window
saw
king
David
dancing
and
and
she
despised
him
in
her
1Chr16:1
So
they
brought
the
ark
of
and
set
it
in
the
midst
of
the
tent
that
David
had
pitched
for
and
they
offered
burnt
sacrifices
and
peace
offerings
before
1Chr16:2
And
when
David
had
made
an
end
of
offering
the
burnt
offerings
and
the
peace
he
blessed
the
people
in
the
name
of
the

And
he
dealt
to
every
one
of
both

and
to
every
one
a
loaf
of

a
good
piece
of

a

of
1Chr16:4
And
he
appointed
certain
of
the
Levites
to
minister
before
the
ark
of
the
and
to
and
to
thank
and
praise
the
LORD
God

Benaiah
also
and
Jahaziel
the
priests
with
trumpets
continually
before
the
ark
of
the

Then
on
that
day
David
delivered

departed

David
returned
to
bless
his

Now
it
came
to
as
David
sat
in
his
that
David
said
to
Nathan
the
I
dwell
in
an
house
of
cedars,
but
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
LORD
remaineth
under
1Chr17:2
Then
Nathan
said
unto
Do
all
that
is
in
thine
for
God
is
with
1Chr17:3
And
it
came
to
pass
the
same
that
the
word
of
God
came
to
1Chr17:4
Go
and
tell
David
my
Thus
saith
the
Thou
shalt
not
build
me
an
house
to
dwell
1Chr17:5
For
I
have
not
dwelt
in
an
house
since
the
day
that
I
brought
up
Israel
unto
this
but
have
gone
from
tent
to
an
d
from
one
tabernacle
to
1Chr17:6
Wheresoever
I
have
walked
with
all
spake
I
a
word
to
any
of
the
judges
of
whom
I
commanded
to
feed
my
peop
le,
Why
have
ye
not
built
me
an
house
of
cedars?
1Chr17:7
Now
therefore
thus
shalt
thou
say
unto
my
servant
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
I
took
thee
from
the
eve
n
from
following
the
that
thou
shouldest
be
ruler
over
my
people
1Chr17:8
And
I
have
been
with
thee
whithersoever
thou
hast
and
have
cut
off
all
thine
enemies
from
before
and
have
ma
de
thee
a
name
like
the
name
of
the
great
men
that
are
in
the
1Chr17:9
Also
I
will
ordain
a
place
for
my
people
and
will
plant
and
they
shall
dwell
in
their
and
shall
be
mo
ved
no
neither
shall
the
children
of
wickedness
waste
them
any
as
at
the
1Chr17:10
And
since
the
time
that
I
commanded
judges
to
be
over
my
people
Moreover
I
will
subdue
all
thine
Further
more
I
tell
thee
that
the
LORD
will
build
thee
an
1Chr17:11
And
it
shall
come
to
when
thy
days
be
expired
that
thou
must
go
to
be
with
thy
that
I
will
raise
up
thy
se
ed
after
which
shall
be
of
thy
and
I
will
establish
his
1Chr17:12
He
shall
build
me
an
and
I
will
stablish
his
throne
for
1Chr17:13
I
will
be
his
and
he
shall
be
my
and
I
will
not
take
my
mercy
away
from
as
I
took
it
from
him
that
was
before
1Chr17:14
But
I
will
settle
him
in
mine
house
and
in
my
kingdom
for
and
his
throne
shall
be
established
for
1Chr17:15
According
to
all
these
and
according
to
all
this
so
did
Nathan
speak
unto
1Chr17:16
And
David
the
king
came
and
sat
before
the
and
Who
am
O
LORD
and
what
is
mine
that
thou
hast
b
rought
me
1Chr17:17
And
yet
this
was
a
small
thing
in
thine
O
for
thou
hast
also
spoken
of
thy
servant's
house
for
a
great
while
t
o
and
hast
regarded
me
according
to
the
estate
of
a
man
of
high
O
LORD
1Chr17:18
What
can
David
speak
more
to
thee
for
the
honour
of
thy
for
thou
knowest
thy
1Chr17:19
O
for
thy
servant's
and
according
to
thine
own
hast
thou
done
all
this
in
making
known
all
these
great
1Chr17:20
O
there
is
none
like
neither
is
there
any
God
beside
according
to
all
that
we
have
heard
with
our
1Chr17:21
And
what
one
nation
in
the
earth
is
like
thy
people
whom
God
went
to
redeem
to
be
his
own
to
make
thee
a
name
of
greatness
and
by
driving
out
nations
from
before
thy
whom
thou
hast
redeemed
out
of
1Chr17:22
For
thy
people
Israel
didst
thou
make
thine
own
people
for
and
becamest
their
1Chr17:23
Therefore
let
the
thing
that
thou
hast
spoken
concerning
thy
servant
and
concerning
his
house
be
established
f
or
and
do
as
thou
hast
1Chr17:24
Let
it
even
be
that
thy
name
may
be
magnified
for
The
LORD
of
hosts
is
the
God
of
even
a
God
to
and
let
the
house
of
David
thy
servant
be
established
before
1Chr17:25
For
O
my
hast
told
thy
servant
that
thou
wilt
build
him
an
therefore
thy
servant
hath
found
in
his
hear
t
to
pray
before
1Chr17:26
And
thou
art
and
hast
promised
this
goodness
unto
thy
1Chr17:27
Now
therefore
let
it
please
thee
to
bless
the
house
of
thy
that
it
may
be
before
thee
for

Now
after
this
it
came
to
that
David
smote
the
and
subdued
and
took
Gath
and
her
towns
out
of
the
hand
of
the
1Chr18:2
And
he
smote
and
the
Moabites
became
David's
and
brought
1Chr18:3
And
David
smote
Hadarezer
king
of
Zobah
unto
Hamath,
as
he
went
to
stablish
his
dominion
by
the
river
1Chr18:4
And
David
took
from
him
a
thousand
and
seven
thousand
and
twenty
thousand
David
also
houghed
all
the
chariot
but
reserved
of
them
an
hundred
1Chr18:5
And
when
the
Syrians
of
Damascus
came
to
help
Hadarezer
king
of
Zobah,
David
slew
of
the
Syrians
two
and
twenty
thousand

1Chr18:6
Then
David
put
garrisons
in
Syriadamascus;
and
the
Syrians
became
David's
and
brought
Thus
the
LORD
prese
rved
David
whithersoever
he
1Chr18:7
And
David
took
the
shields
of
gold
that
were
on
the
servants
of
Hadarezer,
and
brought
them
to
1Chr18:8
Likewise
from
Tibhath,
and
from
Chun,
cities
of
Hadarezer,
brought
David
very
much
wherewith
Solomon
made
the
brase
n
and
the
and
the
vessels
of
1Chr18:9
Now
when
Tou
king
of
Hamath
heard
how
David
had
smitten
all
the
host
of
Hadarezer
king
of
Zobah;
1Chr18:10
He
sent
Hadoram
his
son
to
king
to
enquire
of
his
and
to
congratulate
because
he
had
fought
against
Hadarezer,
and
smitten
(for
Hadarezer
had
war
with
Tou;)
and
with
him
all
manner
of
vessels
of
gold
and
silver
and

Them
also

David
dedicated

he
brought
from
all
these
from
E

from

from
the
children

from
the
and
from
Amalek.
1Chr18:12
Moreover
Abishai
the
son
of
Zeruiah
slew
of
the
Edomites
in
the
valley
of
salt
eighteen
1Chr18:13
And
he
put
garrisons
in
and
all
the
Edomites
became
David's
Thus
the
LORD
preserved
David
whithersoever
h

1Chr18:14
So
David
reigned
over
all
and
executed
judgment
and
justice
among
all
his
1Chr18:15
And
Joab
the
son
of
Zeruiah
was
over

Jehoshaphat
the
son
of
Ahilud,

son
of
Ahitub,
and

Shavsha
was

And
Benaiah
the
son
of
Jehoiada
was
over
the
Cherethites
and
the
Pelethites;
and
the
sons
of
David
were
chief
about

1Chr19:1
Now
it
came
to
pass
after
that
Nahash
the
king
of
the
children
of
Ammon
and
his
son
reigned
in
his

And
David
I
will
shew

Hanun
the
son
of
Nahash,
because
his
father
shewed
kindness
to
And
David
sen

messengers
to

concerning

So
the
servants
of
David
came
into
the
land
of
the
children
of
Ammon
to
Hanun,
t
o
comfort
1Chr19:3
But
the
princes
of
the
children
of
Ammon
said
to
Hanun,
Thinkest
thou
that
David
doth
honour
thy
that
he
hath
sent

Wherefore
Hanun
took
David's

shaved
and
cut
off
their
garments
in
the
midst
hard
by
their

them
1Chr19:5
Then
there
went
and
told
David
how
the
men
were

he
sent
to
meet

the
men

And
the
king
Tarry
at
Jericho
until

then
1Chr19:6
And
when
the
children
of
Ammon
saw
that
they
had
made
themselves
odious
to
Hanun
and
the
children
of
Ammon
sent
a

housand
talents
of
silver
to
hire
them
chariots
and
horsemen
out
of
and
out
of
Syriamaachah,
and
out
of
Zobah.
1Chr19:7
So
they
hired
thirty
and
two
thousand
and
the
king
of
Maachah
and
his
who
came
and
pitched
before
Medeba
.
And
the
children
of
Ammon
gathered
themselves
together
from
their
and
came
to
1Chr19:8
And
when
David
heard
of
he
sent
and
all
the
host
of
the
mighty
1Chr19:9
And
the
children
of
Ammon
came
and
put
the
battle
in
array
before
the
gate
of
the
and
the
kings
that
were
come
were
by
themselves
in
the
1Chr19:10
Now
when
Joab
saw
that
the
battle
was
set
against
him
before
and
he
chose
out
of
all
the
choice
of
and
pu

them
in
array
against
the
1Chr19:11
And
the
rest
of
the
people
he
delivered
unto
the
hand
of
Abishai
his
and
they
set
themselves
in
array
against
th

children
of
1Chr19:12
And
he
If
the
Syrians
be
too
strong
for

thou
shalt
help
but
if
the
children
of
Ammon
be
too
strong

I
will

Be

let
us
behave
ourselves
valiantly
for
our
and
for
the
cities
of
our
and
let
the
LORD
do
that
which
is
good
in
his
1Chr19:14
So
Joab
and
the
people
that
were
with
him
drew
nigh
before
the
Syrians
unto
the
and
they
fled
before
1Chr19:15
And
when
the
children
of
Ammon
saw
that
the
Syrians
were
they
likewise
fled
before
Abishai
his
and
entered
into

Then
Joab
came
to
1Chr19:16
And
when
the
Syrians
saw
that
they
were
put
to
the
worse

they
sent
and
drew
forth
the
Syrians
that
were
beyond

and
Shophach
the
captain
of
the
host
of
Hadarezer
went
before
1Chr19:17
And
it
was
told
and
he
gathered
all
and
passed
over
and
came
upon

set
the
battle
in

So
when
David
had
put
the
battle
in
array
against
the
they
fought
with
1Chr19:18
But
the
Syrians
fled
before
and
David
slew
of
the
Syrians
seven
thousand
men
which
fought
in
and
forty
thousand
and
killed
Shophach
the
captain
of
the
1Chr19:19
And
when
the
servants
of
Hadarezer
saw
that
they
were
put
to
the
worse
before
they
made
peace
with

bec
ame

neither
would
the
Syrians
help
the
children
of
Ammon

1Chr20:1
And
it
came
to
that
after
the
year
was
at
the
time
that
kings
go
out
to
Joab
led
forth
the
power
of
the
and
wasted
the
country
of
the
children
of
and
came
and
besieged
Rabbah.
But
David
tarried
at
And
Joab
smote
Rabbah,
and
destroyed
1Chr20:2
And
David
took
the
crown
of
their
king
from
off
his
and
found
it
to
weigh
a
talent
of
and
there
were
precious
stones
in
and
it
was
set
upon
David's
and
he
brought
also
exceeding
much
spoil
out
of
the
1Chr20:3
And
he
brought
out
the
people
that
were
in
and
cut
them
with
and
with
harrows
of
and
with
Even
so
de
alt
David
with
all
the
cities
of
the
children
of
And
David
and
all
the
people
returned
to
1Chr20:4
And
it
came
to
pass
after
that
there
arose
war
at
Gezer
with
the
at
which
time
Sibbechai
the
Hushathite
slew
Sippai,
that
was
of
the
children
of
the
and
they
were
1Chr20:5
And
there
was
war
again
with
the
and
Elhanan
the
son
of
Jair
slew
Lahmi
the
brother
of
Goliath
the
Gittite,
w
hose
spear
staff
was
like
a
weaver's
1Chr20:6
And
yet
again
there
was
war
at
where
was
a
man
of
great
whose
fingers
and
toes
were
four
and
six
on
each
and
six
on
each
foot
and
he
also
was
the
son
of
the
1Chr20:7
But
when
he
defied
Jonathan
the
son
of
Shimea
David's
brother
slew
1Chr20:8
These
were
born
unto
the
giant
in
and
they
fell
by
the
hand
of
and
by
the
hand
of
his
1Chr21:1
And
Satan
stood
up
against
and
provoked
David
to
number
1Chr21:2
And
David
said
to
Joab
and
to
the
rulers
of
the
number
Israel
from
Beersheba
even
to
and
bring
the
number
of
them
to
that
I
may
know
1Chr21:3
And
Joab
The
LORD
make
his
people
an
hundred
times
so
many
more
as
they
my
lord
the
are
they
not
all
my
lord's
why
then
doth
my
lord
require
this
why
will
he
be
a
cause
of
trespass
to
1Chr21:4
Nevertheless
the
king's
word
prevailed
against
Wherefore
Joab
and
went
throughout
all
and
came
to
1Chr21:5
And
Joab
gave
the
sum
of
the
number
of
the
people
unto
And
all
they
of
Israel
were
a
thousand
thousand
and
an
hundr
ed
thousand
men
that
drew
and
Judah
was
four
hundred
threescore
and
ten
thousand
men
that
drew
1Chr21:6
But
Levi
and
Benjamin
counted
he
not
among
for
the
king's
word
was
abominable
to
1Chr21:7
And
God
was
displeased
with
this
therefore
he
smote
1Chr21:8
And
David
said
unto
I
have
sinned
because
I
have
done
this
but
I
beseech
do
away
the
iniqu
ity
of
thy
for
I
have
done
very
1Chr21:9
And
the
LORD
spake
unto
David's
1Chr21:10
Go
and
tell
Thus
saith
the
I
offer
thee
three

thee
one
of

I
may
do
it
unto
1Chr21:11
So
Gad
came
to
and
said
unto
Thus
saith
the
Choose
thee
1Chr21:12
Either
three
or
three
months
to
be
destroyed
before

LORD
destroying

out
all
the
coasts
of
Now
therefore
advise
thyself
what
word
I
shall
bring
again
to
him
that
sent
1Chr21:13
And
David
said
unto
I
am
in
a
great
let
me
fall
now
into
the
hand
of
the
for
very
great
are
his
mercie

but
let
me
not
fall
into
the
hand
of
1Chr21:14
So
the
LORD
sent
pestilence
upon
and
there
fell
of
Israel
seventy
thousand
1Chr21:15
And
God
sent
an
angel
unto
Jerusalem
to
destroy
and
as
he
was
the
LORD
and
he
repented
him
of
the
and
said
to
the
angel
that
It
is

now
thine
And
the
angel
of
the
LORD
stood
by
the
threshingflo
or
of
Ornan
the
Jebusite.
1Chr21:16
And
David
lifted
up
his
and
saw
the
angel
of
the
LORD
stand
between
the
earth
and
the
having
a
drawn
sword
in
his
hand
stretched
out
over
Then
David
and
the
elders
of
who
were
clothed
in
fell
upon
their
faces
.
1Chr21:17
And
David
said
unto
Is
it
not
I
that
commanded
the
people
to
be
even
I
it
is
that
have
sinned
and
done
evi

but
as
for
these
what
have
they
let

I
pray
O
LORD
my
be
on
and
on
my
father's
hou
but
not
on
thy
that
they
should
be
1Chr21:18
Then
the
angel
of
the
LORD
commanded
Gad
to
say
to
that
David
should
go
and
set
up
an
altar
unto
the
LORD
in
t
he
threshingfloor
of
Ornan
the
Jebusite.
1Chr21:19
And
David
went
up
at
the
saying
of
which
he
spake
in
the
name
of
the
1Chr21:20
And
Ornan
turned
and
saw
the
and
his
four
sons
with
him
hid
Now
Ornan
was
threshing
1Chr21:21
And
as
David
came
to
Ornan,
Ornan
looked
and
saw
and
went
out
of
the
threshingfloor,
and
bowed
himself
to
David
wi
th
his
face
to
the
1Chr21:22
Then
David
said
to
Ornan,
Grant
me
the
place
of
this
threshingfloor,
that
I
may
build
an
altar
therein
unto
the
tho
u
shalt
grant
it
me
for
the
full
that
the
plague
may
be
stayed
from
the
1Chr21:23
And
Ornan
said
unto
Take
it
to
and
let
my
lord
the
king
do
that
which
is
good
in
his
I
give
thee
t
he
oxen
also
for
burnt
and
the
threshing
instruments
for
and
the
wheat
for
the
meat
I
give
it
1Chr21:24
And
king
David
said
to
Ornan,
but
I
will
verily
buy
it
for
the
full
for
I
will
not
take
that
which
is
thine
f
or
the
nor
offer
burnt
offerings
without
1Chr21:25
So
David
gave
to
Ornan
for
the
place
six
hundred
shekels
of
gold
by
1Chr21:26
And
David
built
there
an
altar
unto
the
and
offered
burnt
offerings
and
peace
and
called
upon
the
and
he
answered
him
from
heaven
by
fire
upon
the
altar
of
burnt
1Chr21:27
And
the
LORD
commanded
the
and
he
put
up
his
sword
again
into
the
sheath
1Chr21:28
At
that
time
when
David
saw
that
the
LORD
had
answered
him
in
the
threshingfloor
of
Ornan
the
Jebusite,
then
he
sacrifice

For
the
tabernacle
of
the
which
Moses
made
in

and
the
altar
of
the
burnt

at
that
sea
son
in
the
high
place
at
1Chr21:30
But
David
could
not
go
before
it
to
enquire
of
for
he
was
afraid
because
of
the
sword
of
the
angel
of
the
1Chr22:1
Then
David
This
is
the
house
of
the
LORD
and
this
is
the
altar
of
the
burnt
offering
for
1Chr22:2
And
David
commanded
to
gather
together
the
strangers
that
were
in
the
land
of
and
he
set
masons
to
hew
wrought
sto
nes
to
build
the
house
of
1Chr22:3
And
David
prepared
iron
in
abundance
for
the
nails
for
the
doors
of
the
and
for
the
joinings;
and
brass
in
abundanc

Also
cedar
trees
in

the
Zidonians
and
they
of

brought
much

And
David
Solomon

to
be
builded
for

be
exceeding

of

and
of
glory
throughout

So
David
prepared
abundantly
before
his
1Chr22:6
Then
he
called
for
Solomon

and
charged
him
to
build
an
house
for

And
David

And
Solomon
determined

Blessed

LORD
God
of

with

that
which
he
spake
with

to
my
father
2Chr6:5
Since
the
day
that
I
brought
forth
my
people
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
I
chose
no
city
among
all
the
tribes
of
Israel
to

an
house
that
my
name
might

neither
chose
I
any
man
to
be
a
ruler
over
my
people

But
I
have
chosen
that
my
name
might
be

have
chosen
David
to
be
over
my
people
2Chr6:7
Now
it
was
in
the
heart
of
David
my
father
to
build
an
house
for
the
name
of
the
LORD
God
of
2Chr6:8
But
the
LORD
said
to
David
my
Forasmuch

Notwithstanding

which
shall
come
forth
out
of

The

have
built
the
house
for
the
name
of
the
LORD
God
of

And
in
it
have
I
put
the
wherein
is
the
covenant
of
the
that
he
made
with
the
children
of
2Chr6:12
And
he
stood
before
the
altar
of
the
LORD
in
the
presence
of
all
the
congregation

spread

Solomon

down
upon
his

before
all

spread

his

toward

Now
O

And
king
Solomon
offered
a
sacrifice
of
twenty

two
thousand
and
an
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
so
the
king
and
all
the
people
dedicated

And
the
priests
waited

Moreover
Solomon
hallowed

court
that
was

there
he
offered
burnt
offerin

Thus
Solomon
finished

If

turn
from

wicked

will
I
hear
from

will
forgive
their

Now
mine
eyes
shall
be
and
mine
ears
attent
unto
the
prayer
that
is
made
in
this

For
now
have
I
chosen

sanctified
this

it
to

Because

God
of
their

brought
them
forth
out
of

land
of

laid
hold
on

brought
all
this
evil
upon

it
came
to

end
of
twenty
wherein
Solomon

That

And
Solomon
went
to
Hamathzobah,
and
prevailed
against

And
he
built
Tadmor

But
of

Solomon
make

Now
the
rest
of

of
Ahijah

Shilonite,
and
in

visions
of

against
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat?
2Chr9:30
And
Solomon
reigned
in
Jerusalem
over
all
Israel
forty
2Chr9:31
And
Solomon
slept
with
his
and
he
was
buried
in
the
city
of
David

and
Rehoboam
his
son
reigned
in
his
2Chr10:1
And
Rehoboam
went
to
for
to
Shechem
were
all
Israel
come
to
make
him
2Chr10:2
And
it
came
to
when
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat,
who
was
in
whither
he
had
fled
from
the
presence
of
Solomon
th
e
heard
that
Jeroboam
returned
out
of
2Chr10:3
And
they
sent
and
called
So
Jeroboam
and
all
Israel
came
and
spake
to
2Chr10:4
Thy
father
made
our
yoke
now
therefore
ease
thou
somewhat
the
grievous
servitude
of
thy
and
his
heavy
yo
ke
that
he
put
upon
and
we
will
serve
2Chr10:5
And
he
said
unto
Come
again
unto
me
after
three
And
the
people
2Chr10:6
And
king
Rehoboam
took
counsel
with
the
old
men
that
had
stood
before
Solomon
his
father
while
he
yet
What
counsel
give
ye
me
to
return
answer
to
this
2Chr10:7
And
they
spake
unto
If
thou
be
kind
to
this
and
please
and
speak
good
words
to
they
will
be
thy
servants
for
2Chr10:8
But
he
forsook
the
counsel
which
the
old
men
gave
and
took
counsel
with
the
young
men
that
were
brought
up
with
that
stood
before
2Chr10:9
And
he
said
unto
What
advice
give
ye
that
we
may
return
answer
to
this
which
have
spoken
to
Ease
somewhat
the
yoke
that
thy
father
did
put
upon
2Chr10:10
And
the
young
men
that
were
brought
up
with
him
spake
unto
Thus
shalt
thou
answer
the
people
that
spake
unto
Thy
father
made
our
yoke
but
make
thou
it
somewhat
lighter
for
thus
shalt
thou
say
unto
My
little
f
inger
shall
be
thicker
than
my
father's
2Chr10:11
For
whereas
my
father
put
a
heavy
yoke
upon
I
will
put
more
to
your
my
father
chastised
you
with
but
I
will
chastise
you
with
2Chr10:12
So
Jeroboam
and
all
the
people
came
to
Rehoboam
on
the
third
as
the
king
Come
again
to
me
on
the
third
2Chr10:13
And
the
king
answered
them
and
king
Rehoboam
forsook
the
counsel
of
the
old
2Chr10:14
And
answered
them
after
the
advice
of
the
young
My
father
made
your
yoke
but
I
will
add
my
f
ather
chastised
you
with
but
I
will
chastise
you
with
2Chr10:15
So
the
king
hearkened
not
unto
the
for
the
cause
was
of
that
the
LORD
might
perform
his
which
he
spake
by
the
hand
of
Ahijah
the
Shilonite
to
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat.
2Chr10:16
And
when
all
Israel
saw
that
the
king
would
not
hearken
unto
the
people
answered
the
What
portion
hav
e
we
in
and
we
have
none
inheritance
in
the
son
of
every
man
to
your
O
and
see
to
thine

So
all
Israel
went
to
their
2Chr10:17
But
as
for
the
children
of
Israel
that
dwelt
in
the
cities
of
Rehoboam
reigned
over
2Chr10:18
Then
king
Rehoboam
sent
Hadoram
that
was
over
the
and
the
children
of
Israel
stoned
him
with
that
he
die
d.
But
king
Rehoboam
made
speed
to
get
him
up
to
his
to
flee
to
2Chr10:19
And
Israel
rebelled
against
the
house
of
David
unto
this
2Chr11:1
And
when
Rehoboam
was
come
to
he
gathered
of
the
house
of
Judah
and
Benjamin
an
hundred
and
fourscore
thousand
chosen
which
were
to
fight
against
that
he
might
bring
the
kingdom
again
to
2Chr11:2
But
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
to
Shemaiah
the
man
of
2Chr11:3
Speak
unto
Rehoboam
the
son
of
king
of
and
to
all
Israel
in
Judah
and
2Chr11:4
Thus
saith
the
Ye
shall
not
go
nor
fight
against
your
return
every
man
to
his
for
this
thing
is
done
of
And
they
obeyed
the
words
of
the
and
returned
from
going
against
2Chr11:5
And
Rehoboam
dwelt
in
and
built
cities
for
defence
in
2Chr11:6
He
built
even
and
Etam,
and
Tekoa,
2Chr11:7
And
Bethzur,
and
Shoco,
and
Adullam,
2Chr11:8
And
and
Mareshah,
and
Ziph,
2Chr11:9
And
Adoraim,
and
Lachish,
and
Azekah,
2Chr11:10
And
Zorah,
and
Aijalon,
and
which
are
in
Judah
and
in
Benjamin
fenced
2Chr11:11
And
he
fortified
the
strong
and
put
captains
in
and
store
of
and
of
oil
and
2Chr11:12
And
in
every
several
city
he
put
shields
and
and
made
them
exceeding
having
Judah
and
Benjamin
on
his
sid
e.
2Chr11:13
And
the
priests
and
the
Levites
that
were
in
all
Israel
resorted
to
him
out
of
all
their
2Chr11:14
For
the
Levites
left
their
suburbs
and
their
and
came
to
Judah
and
for
Jeroboam
and
his
sons
had
c
ast
them
off
from
executing
the
priest's
office
unto
the
2Chr11:15
And
he
ordained
him
priests
for
the
high
and
for
the
and
for
the
calves
which
he
had
2Chr11:16
And
after
them
out
of
all
the
tribes
of
Israel
such
as
set
their
hearts
to
seek
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
came
to
to
sacrifice
unto
the
LORD
God
of
their
2Chr11:17
So
they
strengthened
the
kingdom
of
and
made
Rehoboam
the
son
of
Solomon
three
for
three
years
they
walked
in
the
way
of
David
and
2Chr11:18
And
Rehoboam
took
him
Mahalath
the
daughter
of
Jerimoth
the
son
of
David
to
and
Abihail
the
daughter
of
Eliab
the
s
on
of
2Chr11:19
Which
bare
him
Jeush,
and
Shamariah,
and
Zaham.
2Chr11:20
And
after
her
he
took
Maachah
the
daughter
of
which
bare
him
Abijah,
and
Attai,
and
Ziza,
and
Shelomith.
2Chr11:21
And
Rehoboam
loved
Maachah
the
daughter
of
Absalom
above
all
his
wives
and
his
(for
he
took
eighteen
a
nd
threescore
and
begat
twenty
and
eight
and
threescore
daughters.)
2Chr11:22
And
Rehoboam
made
Abijah
the
son
of
Maachah
the
to
be
ruler
among
his
for
he
thought
to
make
him
2Chr11:23
And
he
dealt
and
dispersed
of
all
his
children
throughout
all
the
countries
of
Judah
and
unto
every
fen
ced
and
he
gave
them
victual
in
And
he
desired
many
2Chr12:1
And
it
came
to
when
Rehoboam
had
established
the
and
had
strengthened
he
forsook
the
law
of
the
LO
and
all
Israel
with
2Chr12:2
And
it
came
to
that
in
the
fifth
year
of
king
Rehoboam
Shishak
king
of
Egypt
came
up
against
because
they
had
transgressed
against
the
2Chr12:3
With
twelve
hundred
and
threescore
thousand
and
the
people
were
without
number
that
came
with
him
out
of
the
Lubims,
the
Sukkiims,
and
the
2Chr12:4
And
he
took
the
fenced
cities
which
pertained
to
and
came
to
2Chr12:5
Then
came
Shemaiah
the
prophet
to
and
to
the
princes
of
that
were
gathered
together
to
Jerusalem
because
of
Shishak,
and
said
unto
Thus
saith
the
Ye
have
forsaken
and
therefore
have
I
also
left
you
in
the
hand
of
Shishak
.
2Chr12:6
Whereupon
the
princes
of
Israel
and
the
king
humbled
and
they
The
LORD
is
2Chr12:7
And
when
the
LORD
saw
that
they
humbled
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
to
Shemaiah,
They
have
humbled
thems
therefore
I
will
not
destroy
but
I
will
grant
them
some
and
my
wrath
shall
not
be
poured
out
upon
Jerusal
em
by
the
hand
of
Shishak.
2Chr12:8
Nevertheless
they
shall
be
his
that
they
may
know
my
and
the
service
of
the
kingdoms
of
the
2Chr12:9
So
Shishak
king
of
Egypt
came
up
against
and
took
away
the
treasures
of
the
house
of
the
and
the
treasure
s
of
the
king's
he
took
he
carried
away
also
the
shields
of
gold
which
Solomon
had
2Chr12:10
Instead
of
which
king
Rehoboam
made
shields
of
and
committed
them
to
the
hands
of
the
chief
of
the
that
kep
t
the
entrance
of
the
king's
2Chr12:11
And
when
the
king
entered
into
the
house
of
the
the
guard
came
and
fetched
and
brought
them
again
into
the
gu

2Chr12:12
And
when
he
humbled
the
wrath
of
the
LORD
turned
from
that
he
would
not
destroy
him
and
also
in
Judah
things
went
2Chr12:13
So
king
Rehoboam
strengthened
himself
in
and
for
Rehoboam
was
one
and
forty
years
old
when
he
began
t
o
and
he
reigned
seventeen
years
in
the
city
which
the
LORD
had
chosen
out
of
all
the
tribes
of
to
put
hi

name
And
his
mother's
name
was
Naamah
an
Ammonitess.
2Chr12:14
And
he
did
because
he
prepared
not
his
heart
to
seek
the

Now
the
acts
of
first
and
are
they
not
written

And
the
children

And
Asa
did
that
which
was
good
and
right
in
the
eyes
of
the
LORD
his
2Chr14:3
For
he
took
away
the
altars
of
the
strange

the
high

brake
down

cut
down

And
commanded
Judah
to
seek
the
LORD
God
of
their
and
to
do

law
and

Also
he
took
away
out
of
all
the
cities
of
Judah
the
high
places
and
the
and
the
kingdom
was
quiet
before
2Chr14:6
And
he
built

cities

for
the
land

he
had
no
war
in
those

LORD
had
given

Therefore
he
said
unto
Let
us
build

and
while
the

we

So

And
Asa
had
an
army
of
men
that
bare
targets
and
out
of
Judah
three
hundred
and
out
of
that
ba
re
shields
and
drew
two
hundred
and
fourscore
all
these
were
mighty
men
of
2Chr14:9
And
there
came
out
against
them
Zerah
the
Ethiopian
with
an
host
of
a
thousand
and
three
hundred
and
c
ame
unto
Mareshah.
2Chr14:10
Then
Asa
went
out
against
and
they
set
the
battle
in
array
in
the
valley
of
Zephathah
at
Mareshah.
2Chr14:11
And
Asa
cried
unto
the
LORD
his
and
it
is
nothing
with
thee
to
whether
with
or
with
them
tha
t
have
no
help
O
LORD
our
for
we
rest
on
and
in
thy
name
we
go
against
this
O
thou
art
our
G
od;
let
not
man
prevail
against
2Chr14:12
So
the
LORD
smote
the
Ethiopians
before
Asa,
and
before
and
the
Ethiopians
2Chr14:13
And
Asa
and
the
people
that
were
with
him
pursued
them
unto
Gerar:
and
the
Ethiopians
were
that
they
could
no
t
recover
for
they
were
destroyed
before
the
and
before
his
and
they
carried
away
very
much
2Chr14:14
And
they
smote
all
the
cities
round
about
Gerar;
for
the
fear
of
the
LORD
came
upon
and
they
spoiled
all
the
cities
;
for
there
was
exceeding
much
spoil
in
2Chr14:15
They
smote
also
the
tents
of
and
carried
away
sheep
and
camels
in
and
returned
to
2Chr15:1
And
the
Spirit
of
God
came
upon
Azariah
the
son
of
2Chr15:2
And
he
went
out
to
meet
Asa,
and
said
unto
Hear
ye
Asa,
and
all
Judah
and
The
LORD
is
with
while
y

be
with
and
if
ye
seek
he
will
be
found
of
but
if
ye
forsake
he
will
forsake
2Chr15:3
Now
for
a
long
season
Israel
hath
been
without
the
true
and
without
a
teaching
and
without
2Chr15:4
But
when
they
in
their
trouble
did
turn
unto
the
LORD
God
of
and
sought
he
was
found
of
2Chr15:5
And
in
those
times
there
was
no
peace
to
him
that
went
nor
to
him
that
came
but
great
vexations
were
upon
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
2Chr15:6
And
nation
was
destroyed
of
and
city
of
for
God
did
vex
them
with
all

Be
ye
strong
and
let
not
your
hands
be
for
your
work

be
2Chr15:8
And
when
Asa
heard
these
and
the
prophecy
of
Oded
the
he
took
and
put
away
the
abominable
idols
o
ut
of
all
the
land
of
Judah
and
and
out
of
the
cities
which
he
had
taken
from
mount
and
renewed
the
altar
of
the
that
was
before
the
porch
of
the
2Chr15:9
And
he
gathered
all
Judah
and
and
the
strangers
with
them
out
of
Ephraim
and
and
out
of
for

fell
to
him
out
of
Israel
in
when
they
saw
that
the
LORD
his
God
was
with

So
they
gathered
themselves
together
at
Jerusalem
in
the
third
in
the
fifteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
Asa.
2Chr15:11
And
they
offered
unto
the
LORD
the
same
of
the
spoil
which
they
had
seven
hundred
oxen
and
seven
thousand
2Chr15:12
And
they
entered
into
a
covenant
to
seek
the
LORD
God
of
their
fathers
with
all
their
heart
and
with
all
their
2Chr15:13
That
whosoever
would
not
seek
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
should
be
put
to
whether
small
or
whether
man
or
woman
.
2Chr15:14
And
they
sware
unto
the
LORD
with
a
loud
and
with
and
with
and
with
cornets.
2Chr15:15
And
all
Judah
rejoiced
at
the
for
they
had
sworn
with
all
their
and
sought
him
with
their
whole
and
he
was
found
of
and
the
LORD
gave
them
rest
round
2Chr15:16
And
also
concerning
Maachah
the
mother
of
Asa
the
he
removed
her
from
being
because
she
had
made
an
idol
in
a
and
Asa
cut
down
her
and
stamped
and
burnt
it
at
the
brook
2Chr15:17
But
the
high
places
were
not
taken
away
out
of
nevertheless
the
heart
of
Asa
was
perfect
all
his
2Chr15:18
And
he
brought
into
the
house
of
God
the
things
that
his
father
had
and
that
he
himself
had
and
and
2Chr15:19
And
there
was
no
more
war
unto
the
five
and
thirtieth
year
of
the
reign
of
Asa.
2Chr16:1
In
the
six
and
thirtieth
year
of
the
reign
of
Asa
Baasha
king
of
Israel
came
up
against
and
built
Ramah,
to
the
int
ent
that
he
might
let
none
go
out
or
come
in
to
Asa
king
of
2Chr16:2
Then
Asa
brought
out
silver
and
gold
out
of
the
treasures
of
the
house
of
the
LORD
and
of
the
king's
and
sent
to
Be
nhadad
king
of
that
dwelt
at
2Chr16:3
There
is
a
league
between
me
and
as
there
was
between
my
father
and
thy
I
have
sent
thee
silver
and
break
thy
league
with
Baasha
king
of
that
he
may
depart
from
2Chr16:4
And
Benhadad
hearkened
unto
king
Asa,
and
sent
the
captains
of
his
armies
against
the
cities
of
and
they
smote
Ijo
n,
and
and
Abelmaim,
and
all
the
store
cities
of
2Chr16:5
And
it
came
to
when
Baasha
heard
that
he
left
off
building
of
Ramah,
and
let
his
work
2Chr16:6
Then
Asa
the
king
took
all
and
they
carried
away
the
stones
of
Ramah,
and
the
timber
wherewith
Baasha
was
and
he
built
therewith
Geba
and
Mizpah.
2Chr16:7
And
at
that
time
Hanani
the
seer
came
to
Asa
king
of
and
said
unto
Because
thou
hast
relied
on
the
king
of
Syr
and
not
relied
on
the
LORD
thy
therefore
is
the
host
of
the
king
of
Syria
escaped
out
of
thine

Were
not
the
Ethiopians
and
the
Lubims
a
huge
with
very
many
chariots
and
because
thou
didst
rely
on
the

delivered
them
into
thine

For
the
eyes
of
the
LORD

to

fro
throughout
the
whole
to

himself
strong

of
them
whose

is
perfect
toward

Then
Asa
was
wroth
with
the
and
put
him
in
a
prison
for
he
was
in
a
rage
with
him
because
of
this
And
Asa
oppressed
some
of
the
people

same

acts
of
Asa,
first
and
they
are
written
in
the
book
of
the
kings
of
Judah
and
2Chr16:12
And
Asa
in
the
thirty
and
ninth
year
of
his
reign
was
diseased
in
his
until
his
disease
was
exceeding
yet
in
his
disease
he
sought
not
to

but
to
the

And
Asa
slept
with
his
and
died
in
the
one
and
fortieth
year
of
his
2Chr16:14
And
they
buried
him
in
his
own
which
he
had
made
for
himself
in
the
city
of
and
laid
him
in
the
bed
wh

was
filled
with
sweet
odours
and
divers
kinds
of
spices
prepared
by
the
apothecaries'
and
they
made
a
very
great
burning
f

And
Jehoshaphat
his
son
reigned
in
his
and
strengthened
himself
against

And
he
placed
forces
in
all
the
fenced
cities
of
and
set
garrisons
in
the
land
of
and
in
the
cities
of
Ephra
which
Asa
his
father
had
2Chr17:3
And
the
LORD
was
with
because
he
walked
in
the
first
ways
of
his
father
and
sought
not
unto
Baalim;
2Chr17:4
But
sought
to
the
Lord
God
of
his
and
walked
in
his
and
not
after
the
doings
of

Therefore
the
LORD
stablished
the
kingdom
in
his
and
all
Judah
brought
to
Jehoshaphat
and
he
had
riches

And
his
heart
was
lifted
up
in
the
ways
of

he
took
away
the
high
places
and
groves
out
of

Also
in

he
sent

unto
Jehoshaphat
king
of
Wilt
thou
go

me
to

And
he
answered
I
am
as
thou
and
my
people
as
thy

we
will
be
with
thee
in
the

And
Jehoshaphat
said
unto
the
king
of
I
pray
at
the
word
of
the
LORD
to

Therefore
the
king
of
Israel
gathered
together
of

four
hundred

said
unto

And
they
Go

But
Jehoshaphat
Is
there
not
here
a
prophet
of
the
LORD
that
we
might
enquire
of
2Chr18:7
And
the
king
of
Israel
said
unto
There
is
yet
one
by
whom
we
may
enquire
of
the
but
I
hate
fo

never
prophesied
good
unto
but
always
the

is
Micaiah
the
son
of
Imla.
And
Jehoshaphat
Let
not

And
the
king
of
Israel
called

Fetch

2Chr18:9
And
the
king
of
Israel
and
Jehoshaphat
king
of
Judah
sat
either
of
them
on

they

place
at
the
entering
in
of

prophesied
before

And
Zedekiah
the
son
of
Chenaanah
had
made
him

Thus
saith
the
With

and
for

LORD
shall
deliver

And
the
messenger
that
went
to
call

spake
to
the
words
of

And
Micaiah
As

And
when
he
was
come
to
the
the
king
said
unto
Micaiah,

And
he
Go

and
they
shall
be
delivered

And
the
king
said
to
How
many
times
shall
I
adjure
thee
that
thou
say
nothing
but
the
truth
to
me
in
the
name
of
the
2Chr18:16
Then
he
I
did
see
all
Israel
scattered
upon

as
sheep
that
have
no

the
LORD
These
have
no
let
them
return
therefore
every
man
to
his
house
in
2Chr18:17
And
the
king
of
Israel
said
to
Did
I
not
tell
thee
that
he
would
not
prophesy
good
unto
but
2Chr18:18
Again
he
Therefore
hear
the
word
of

I
saw
the

sitting
upon

all
the
host
of

And
the
LORD
Who
shall
entice
Ahab
king
of

he
may
go
up
and
fall
at
Ramothgilead?
And
one
spake
saying
after
this
and
another
saying
after
that
2Chr18:20
Then
there
came
out
a
and
stood
before
the
and
I
will
entice
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Wherewi
2Chr18:21
And
he
I
will
go
and
be

mouth
of

And
the
Lord
Thou
shalt
entice
and
thou
shalt
also
go
and
do
even
2Chr18:22
Now
the
LORD
hath
put
a
lying
spirit
in
the
mouth
of
these
thy
and
the
LORD
hath
spoken
evil
against

Then
Zedekiah
the
son
of
Chenaanah
came
and
smote
Micaiah
upon
the
and
Which
way
went
the
Spirit
of
th

LORD
from
me
to
speak
unto
2Chr18:24
And
Micaiah
thou
shalt
see
on
that
day
when
thou
shalt
go
into
an
inner
chamber
to
hide

Then
the
king
of
Israel
Take

Micaiah,
and
carry

Thus
saith

And
Micaiah
If
thou
certainly
return

2Chr18:28
So
the
king
of
Israel
and
Jehoshaphat
the
king
of
Judah
went
up
to
Ramothgilead.
2Chr18:29
And
the
king
of
Israel
said
unto
I
will
disguise

will
go

So
the
king
of
Israel
disguised

they
went

Now
the
king
of
Syria
had
commanded
the

Jehoshaphat
cried
and
the
LORD
helped

God
moved
them
to
depart
from

For
it
came
to
when
the
captains
of
the
chariots
perceived
that
it
was
not
the
king
of

turned
ba

again
from
pursuing

And
a
certain
man
drew
a
bow
at

And
the
battle
increased
that
howbeit
the
king
of
Israel
stayed
himself
up
in
his
chariot
against
the
Syrians
until
the

about
the
time
of

going

And
Jehoshaphat
the
king
of
Judah
returned
to
his
house
in
peace
to

And
Jehu
the
son
of
Hanani
the
seer
went
out
to

said
to

Nevertheless
there

hast
taken
away
the

out
of

hast
prepar

And
Jehoshaphat
dwelt
at

he
went
out
again
through
the
people
from
Beersheba
to
mount

brought
them
back

And
he
set

Moreover

And
Jehoshaphat
and
set
himself
to

proclaimed
a

And
Judah
gathered
themselves
to
ask

And
Jehoshaphat
bowed
his
head
with
his
face
to
the
and
all
Judah
and
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
fell
before

worshipping

And
the
Levites,
of
the
children
of
the
Kohathites,
and
of
the
children
of
the
Korhites,
stood
up
to
praise
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
with
a
loud
voice
on
2Chr20:20
And
they
rose
early
in
the
and
went
forth
into
the
wilderness
of
Tekoa:
and
as
they
went
Jehoshaphat
stoo
d
and
Hear

And
when
he
had
consulted
with

appointed
singers
unto

as
they
went
out
before

to
Praise

And
when
they
began
to
sing

to
the
LORD
set
ambushments
against
the
children
of

mount
Seir,
which
were

they
were

For
the
children
of
Ammon
and
Moab
stood
up
against
the
inhabitants
of
mount
Seir,
utterly
to
slay
and
destroy
and
when
they
had
made
an
end
of
the
inhabitants
of
Seir,
every
one
helped
to
destroy
2Chr20:24
And
when
Judah
came
toward
the
watch
tower
in
the
they
looked
unto
the
they
were
dead
bodies
fallen
to

and
none

And
when
Jehoshaphat
and
his
people
came
to
take
away
the
spoil
of

found
among
them
in
abundance
both
riches
w

the
dead
and
precious
which
they
stripped
off
for
more
than
they
could
carry
and
they
were
th
ree
days
in
gathering
of
the
it
was
so
2Chr20:26
And
on
the
fourth
day
they
assembled
themselves
in
the
valley
of
Berachah;
for
there
they
blessed
the
therefore
the
name
of
the
same
place
was
The
valley
of
Berachah,
unto
this
2Chr20:27
Then
they
every
man
of
Judah
and
and
Jehoshaphat
in
the
forefront
of
to
go
again
to
Jerusalem
with
for
the
LORD
had
made
them
to
rejoice
over
their
2Chr20:28
And
they
came
to
Jerusalem
with
psalteries
and
harps
and
trumpets
unto
the
house
of
the
2Chr20:29
And
the
fear
of
God
was
on
all
the
kingdoms
of
those
when
they
had
heard
that
the
LORD
fought
against
the
enem

of
2Chr20:30
So
the
realm
of
Jehoshaphat
was
for
his
God
gave
him
rest
round
2Chr20:31
And
Jehoshaphat
reigned
over

was
thirty
and
five
years
old
when
he
began
to
and
he
reigned
twenty
and
fi
ve
years
in
And
his
mother's
name
was
Azubah
the
daughter
of
Shilhi.
2Chr20:32
And
he
walked
in
the
way
of
Asa
his
and
departed
not
from
doing
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD
.
2Chr20:33
Howbeit
the
high
places
were
not
taken
for
as
yet
the
people
had
not
prepared
their
hearts
unto
the
God
of
their
fa

2Chr20:34
Now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
first
and
they
are
written
in
the
book
of
Jehu
the
son
of
Hanani,
who
is
mentioned
in
the
book
of
the
kings
of
2Chr20:35
And
after
this
did
Jehoshaphat
king
of
Judah
join
himself
with
Ahaziah
king
of
who
did
very
2Chr20:36
And
he
joined
himself
with
him
to
make
ships
to
go
to
and
they
made
the
ships
in
Eziongaber.
2Chr20:37
Then
Eliezer
the
son
of
Dodavah
of
Mareshah
prophesied
against
Because
thou
hast
joined
thyself
with
Ahaziah,
the
LORD
hath
broken
thy
And
the
ships
were
that
they
were
not
able
to
go
to
2Chr21:1
Now
Jehoshaphat
slept
with
his
and
was
buried
with
his
fathers
in
the
city
of
And
Jehoram
his
son
reigned
in
his
2Chr21:2
And
he
had
brethren
the
sons
of
Azariah,
and
Jehiel,
and
and
Azariah,
and
and
Shephatiah:
all
these
were
the
sons
of
Jehoshaphat
king
of
2Chr21:3
And
their
father
gave
them
great
gifts
of
and
of
and
of
precious
with
fenced
cities
in
but
th
e
kingdom
gave
he
to
Jehoram;
because
he
was

Now
when
Jehoram
was
risen
up
to
the
kingdom
of
his
he
strengthened
and
slew
all
his
brethren
with
the
sw
ord,
and
divers
also
of
the
princes
of
2Chr21:5
Jehoram
was
thirty
and
two
years
old
when
he
began
to
and
he
reigned
eight
years
in
2Chr21:6
And
he
walked
in
the
way
of
the
kings
of
like
as
did
the
house
of
for
he
had
the
daughter
of
Ahab
to
a

he
wrought
that
which
was
evil
in
the
eyes
of
the
2Chr21:7
Howbeit
the
LORD
would
not
destroy
the
house
of
because
of
the
covenant
that
he
had
made
with

a
perfect
2Chr25:3
Now
it
came
to
when
the
kingdom
was
established
to
that
he
slew
his
servants
that
had
killed
the
king
his
fathe
r.
2Chr25:4
But
he
slew
not
their
but
did
as
it
is
written
in
the
law
in
the
book
of
where
the
LORD
saying
,
The
fathers
shall
not
die
for
the
neither
shall
the
children
die
for
the
but
every
man
shall
die
for
his
own
s
2Chr25:5
Moreover
Amaziah
gathered
Judah
and
made
them
captains
over
and
captains
over
according
to
the
houses
of
their
throughout
all
Judah
and
and
he
numbered
them
from
twenty
years
old
and
and
found
the
m
three
hundred
thousand
choice
able
to
go
forth
to
that
could
handle
spear
and
2Chr25:6
He
hired
also
an
hundred
thousand
mighty
men
of
valour
out
of
Israel
for
an
hundred
talents
of
2Chr25:7
But
there
came
a
man
of
God
to
O
let
not
the
army
of
Israel
go
with
for
the
LORD
is
not
with
Isra
to
with
all
the
children
of
2Chr25:8
But
if
thou
wilt
do
be
strong
for
the
God
shall
make
thee
fall
before
the
for
God
hath
power
to
hel
p,
and
to
cast
2Chr25:9
And
Amaziah
said
to
the
man
of
But
what
shall
we
do
for
the
hundred
talents
which
I
have
given
to
the
army
of
And
the
man
of
God
The
LORD
is
able
to
give
thee
much
more
than
2Chr25:10
Then
Amaziah
separated
to
the
army
that
was
come
to
him
out
of
to
go
home
wherefore
their
ange
r
was
greatly
kindled
against
and
they
returned
home
in
great
2Chr25:11
And
Amaziah
strengthened
and
led
forth
his
and
went
to
the
valley
of
and
smote
of
the
children
of
Seir
ten
2Chr25:12
And
other
ten
thousand
left
alive
did
the
children
of
Judah
carry
away
and
brought
them
unto
the
top
of
the
rock
,
and
cast
them
down
from
the
top
of
the
that
they
all
were
broken
in
2Chr25:13
But
the
soldiers
of
the
army
which
Amaziah
sent
that
they
should
not
go
with
him
to
fell
upon
the
cities
of
from
Samaria
even
unto
Bethhoron,
and
smote
three
thousand
of
and
took
much
2Chr25:14
Now
it
came
to
after
that
Amaziah
was
come
from
the
slaughter
of
the
Edomites,
that
he
brought
the
gods
of
the
chil
dren
of
Seir,
and
set
them
up
to
be
his
and
bowed
down
himself
before
and
burned
incense
unto
2Chr25:15
Wherefore
the
anger
of
the
LORD
was
kindled
against
Amaziah,
and
he
sent
unto
him
a
which
said
unto
Why
has
t
thou
sought
after
the
gods
of
the
which
could
not
deliver
their
own
people
out
of
thine
2Chr25:16
And
it
came
to
as
he
talked
with
that
the
king
said
unto
Art
thou
made
of
the
king's
wh
y
shouldest
thou
be
Then
the
prophet
forbare,
and
I
know
that
God
hath
determined
to
destroy
because
thou
hast
done
and
hast
not
hearkened
unto
my
2Chr25:17
Then
Amaziah
king
of
Judah
took
and
sent
to
Joash,
the
son
of
Jehoahaz,
the
son
of
king
of
let
us
see
one
another
in
the
2Chr25:18
And
Joash
king
of
Israel
sent
to
Amaziah
king
of
The
thistle
that
was
in
Lebanon
sent
to
the
cedar
that
wa
s
in
Give
thy
daughter
to
my
son
to
and
there
passed
by
a
wild
beast
that
was
in
and
trode
down
the
2Chr25:19
Thou
sayest,
thou
hast
smitten
the
Edomites;
and
thine
heart
lifteth
thee
up
to
abide
now
at
why
shoulde
st
thou
meddle
to
thine
that
thou
shouldest
even
and
Judah
with
2Chr25:20
But
Amaziah
would
not
for
it
came
of
that
he
might
deliver
them
into
the
hand
of
their
because
they
s
ought
after
the
gods
of
2Chr25:21
So
Joash
the
king
of
Israel
went
and
they
saw
one
another
in
the
both
he
and
Amaziah
king
of
at
Bethshem
esh,
which
belongeth
to
2Chr25:22
And
Judah
was
put
to
the
worse
before
and
they
fled
every
man
to
his
2Chr25:23
And
Joash
the
king
of
Israel
took
Amaziah
king
of
the
son
of
Joash,
the
son
of
Jehoahaz,
at
Bethshemesh,
and
broug
ht
him
to
and
brake
down
the
wall
of
Jerusalem
from
the
gate
of
Ephraim
to
the
corner
four
hundred
cubits.
2Chr25:24
And
he
took
all
the
gold
and
the
and
all
the
vessels
that
were
found
in
the
house
of
God
with
Obededom,
and
the
t
reasures
of
the
king's
the
hostages
and
returned
to
2Chr25:25
And
Amaziah
the
son
of
Joash
king
of
Judah
lived
after
the
death
of
Joash
son
of
Jehoahaz
king
of
Israel
fifteen
2Chr25:26
Now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Amaziah,
first
and
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
kings
of
Judah
and
I
srael?
2Chr25:27
Now
after
the
time
that
Amaziah
did
turn
away
from
following
the
LORD
they
made
a
conspiracy
against
him
in
an
d
he
fled
to
Lachish:
but
they
sent
to
Lachish
after
and
slew
him
2Chr25:28
And
they
brought
him
upon
and
buried
him
with
his
fathers
in
the
city
of
2Chr26:1
Then
all
the
people
of
Judah
took
Uzziah,
who
was
sixteen
years
and
made
him
king
in
the
room
of
his
father
Amaziah.
2Chr26:2
He
built
Eloth,
and
restored
it
to

that
the
king
slept
with
his

Sixteen
years
old
was
Uzziah
when
he
began
to
and
he
reigned
fifty
and
two
years
in
His
mother's
name
al
so
was
Jecoliah
of
2Chr26:4
And
he
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
according
to
all
that
his
father
Amaziah
2Chr26:5
And
he
sought
God
in
the
days
of
who
had
understanding
in
the
visions
of
and
as
long
as
he
sought
the
LORD
,
God
made
him
to
2Chr26:6
And
he
went
forth
and
warred
against
the
and
brake
down
the
wall
of
and
the
wall
of
Jabneh,
and
the
wal
l
of
Ashdod,
and
built
cities
about
Ashdod,
and
among
the
2Chr26:7
And
God
helped
him
against
the
and
against
the
Arabians
that
dwelt
in
Gurbaal,
and
the
Mehunims.
2Chr26:8
And
the
Ammonites
gave
gifts
to
Uzziah:
and
his
name
spread
abroad
even
to
the
entering
in
of
for
he
strengthened
h
imself
2Chr26:9
Moreover
Uzziah
built
towers
in
Jerusalem
at
the
corner
and
at
the
valley
and
at
the
turning
of
the
and
fortified
2Chr26:10
Also
he
built
towers
in
the
and
digged
many
for
he
had
much
both
in
the
low
and
in
the
pl
ains:
husbandmen
and
vine
dressers
in
the
and
in
for
he
loved
2Chr26:11
Moreover
Uzziah
had
an
host
of
fighting
that
went
out
to
war
by
according
to
the
number
of
their
account
by
t
he
hand
of
Jeiel
the
scribe
and
Maaseiah
the
under
the
hand
of
Hananiah,
one
of
the
king's
2Chr26:12
The
whole
number
of
the
chief
of
the
fathers
of
the
mighty
men
of
valour
were
two
thousand
and
six
2Chr26:13
And
under
their
hand
was
an
three
hundred
thousand
and
seven
thousand
and
five
that
made
war
with
mighty
p
ower,
to
help
the
king
against
the

And
Uzziah
prepared
for
them
throughout
all
the
host
and
and
and
habergeons,
and
and
slin
gs
to
cast
2Chr26:15
And
he
made
in
Jerusalem
invented
by
cunning
to
be
on
the
towers
and
upon
the
bulwarks,
to
shoot
arrows
and
great
stones
And
his
name
spread
far
for
he
was
marvellously
till
he
was
2Chr26:16
But
when
he
was
his
heart
was
lifted
up
to
his
for
he
transgressed
against
the
LORD
his
and
wen
t
into
the
temple
of
the
LORD
to
burn
incense
upon
the
altar
of
2Chr26:17
And
Azariah
the
priest
went
in
after
and
with
him
fourscore
priests
of
the
that
were
valiant
2Chr26:18
And
they
withstood
Uzziah
the
and
said
unto
It
appertaineth
not
unto
Uzziah,
to
burn
incense
unto
the
LO
but
to
the
priests
the
sons
of

are
consecrated
to
burn
go
out
of
the
for
thou
hast
neither
shall
it
be
for
thine
honour
from
the
LORD
2Chr26:19
Then
Uzziah
was
and
had
a
censer
in
his
hand
to
burn
and
while
he
was
wroth
with
the
the
leprosy
even
rose
up
in
his
forehead
before
the
priests
in
the
house
of
the
from
beside
the
incense
2Chr26:20
And
Azariah
the
chief
and
all
the
looked
upon
he
was
leprous
in
his
and
they
thrust
him
out
from
himself
hasted
also
to
go
because
the
LORD
had
smitten
2Chr26:21
And
Uzziah
the
king
was
a
leper
unto
the
day
of
his
and
dwelt
in
a
several
being
a

he
was
cut

house

Jotham
his
son
was

people
of

Now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Uzziah,
first
and
did
Isaiah
the
the
son
of
Amoz,
2Chr26:23
So
Uzziah
slept
with
his
and
they
buried
him
with
his
fathers
in
the
field
of
the
burial
which
belonged
to
the

for

reigned
sixteen
years
in
His
mother's
name
also
was
Jerushah,
the
daughter
of
Zadok.
2Chr27:2
And
he
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
according
to
all
that
his
father
Uzziah
howbeit
he
entered
not

And
the
people

He
built
the
high
gate
of
the
house
of

and
on
the
wall
of
Ophel
he
built
2Chr27:4
Moreover
he
built
cities
in
the
mountains
of
and
in
the
forests
he
built
castles
and
2Chr27:5
He
fought
also
with
the
king
of

and
prevailed
against
And
the
children
of
Ammon
gave
him

So
much
did
the
children

So
Jotham
became
because
he
prepared
his
ways
before

LORD

Now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Jotham,
and
all
his
and
his
they
are
written
in
the
book
of
the
kings
of
Israe

He
was
five
and
twenty
years
old
when
he
began
to

reigned
sixteen
years
in

And
Jotham
slept
with
his
and
they
buried
him
in

Ahaz

Ahaz
was
twenty
years
old
when

he
did
not
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
like
David

For
he
walked
in
the
ways
of
the
kings
of

made
also
molten
images
for
Baalim.
2Chr28:3
Moreover
he
burnt
incense
in
the
valley
of
the
son
of
Hinnom,
and
burnt
his
children
in

after
the
abominations
o

He
sacrificed
also
and
burnt
incense
in

on

under

Wherefore
the
LORD
his
God
delivered
him
into

carried

he
was
also
delivered
into

smote

For
Pekah
the
son
of
Remaliah
slew
in
Judah
an
hundred

twenty
thousand
in
one
which
were
all
valiant
because
they

Zichri,
a
mighty

governor
of

Elkanah
that
was
next
to

And
the
children
of
Israel
carried
away
captive
of
their
brethren
two
hundred
and
and
to
ok
also
away
much
spoil
from

brought
the
spoil
to
2Chr28:9
But
a
prophet
of
the
LORD
was
whose
name
was

he
went
out
before
the
host
that
came
to
and
said
u

because
the
LORD
God
of
your
fathers
was
wroth
with
he
hath
delivered
them
into
your
and
ye
have
sla
in
them
in
a
rage
that
reacheth
up
unto
2Chr28:10
And
now
ye
purpose
to
keep
under
the
children
of
Judah
and
Jerusalem
for
bondmen
and
bondwomen
unto
but
are
there
no

with
even
with
sins
against

LORD
your

Now
hear
me
and
deliver
the
captives
which
ye
have
taken
captive
of
your
for
the
fierce
wrath
of
the
LORD
is
upon
2Chr28:12
Then
certain
of
the
heads
of
the
children
of
Azariah
the
son
of
Johanan,
Berechiah
the
son
of
Meshillemoth,
and
Jehizkiah
the
son
of
Shallum,
and
Amasa
the
son
of
Hadlai,
stood
up
against
them
that
came
from

And
said
unto
Ye
shall
not
bring
in
the
captives
for
whereas
we
have
offended
against

LORD
ye
intend
to
add
more
to
our
sins
and
to
our
for
our
trespass
is
and
there
is
fierce
wrath
against
2Chr28:14
So
the
armed
men
left
the
captives
and
the
spoil
before
the
princes
and
all
the
2Chr28:15
And
the
men
which
were
expressed
by
name
rose
and
took
the
and
with
the
spoil
clothed
all
that
were
naked
a
mong
and
arrayed
and
shod
and
gave
them
to
eat
and
to

anointed
and
carried
all
the

brought
them
to

they
returned
to

At
that
time
did
king
Ahaz
send
unto
the
kings
of
Assyria
to
help
2Chr28:17
For
again
the
Edomites
had
come
and
smitten
and
carried
away
2Chr28:18
The
Philistines
also
had
invaded
the
cities
of

and
they
dwelt

For
the
LORD
brought
Judah
low
because
of
Ahaz
king
of
for
he
made
Judah

transgressed
sore
against

And
Tilgathpilneser
king
of
Assyria
came
unto
and
distressed
but
strengthened
him

For
Ahaz
took
away
a
portion
out

out
of

house
of

gave
it
unto
the
king

he
helped
him

And
in
the
time
of
his
distress
did
he
trespass
yet
more
against

is
that
king
Ahaz.
2Chr28:23
For
he
sacrificed
unto
the
gods

he
Because

I
sacrifice

But
they
were
the
ruin
of

of
all

And
Ahaz
gathered
together
the
vessels
of
the

that
which
was
right

according

all
that
David

said
unto

Now
it

began
also

king

all
the
congregation

the
singers

all
this
continued
until

offering
was

And
when
they
had
made
an
end
of
the
king
and
all
that
were
present
with
him
bowed
and
2Chr29:30
Moreover
Hezekiah
the
king
and
the
princes
commanded
the
Levites
to
sing
praise
unto

LORD
with
the
words
of
an

And
they
sang
praises
with
and
they
bowed
their
heads
and

Then
Hezekiah
answered
and
Now
ye
have
consecrated
yourselves
unto
the
come
near
and
bring
sacrifices
and
tha
nk
offerings
into
the
house
of
the
And
the
congregation
brought
in
sacrifices
and
thank
and
as
many
as
were
of
a
f
ree
heart
burnt
2Chr29:32
And
the
number
of
the
burnt
which
the
congregation
was
threescore
and
ten
bullocks,
an
hundred
and
two
hundred
all
these
were
for
a
burnt
offering
to
the
2Chr29:33
And
the
consecrated
things
were
six
hundred
oxen
and
three
thousand
2Chr29:34
But
the
priests
were
too
so
that
they
could
not
flay
all
the
burnt
wherefore
their
brethren
the
Levites
d
id
help
till
the
work
was
and
until
the
other
priests
had
sanctified
for
the
Levites
were
more
upright
in
heart
to
sanctify
themselves
than
the
2Chr29:35
And
also
the
burnt
offerings
were
in
with
the
fat
of
the
peace
and
the
drink
offerings
for
every
bu
rnt
So
the
service
of
the
house
of
the
LORD
was
set
in
2Chr29:36
And
Hezekiah
and
all
the
that
God
had
prepared
the
for
the
thing
was
done
2Chr30:1
And
Hezekiah
sent
to
all
Israel
and
and
wrote
letters
also
to
Ephraim
and
that
they
should
come
to
the
ho
use
of
the
LORD
at
to
keep
the
passover
unto
the
LORD
God
of
2Chr30:2
For
the
king
had
taken
and
his
and
all
the
congregation
in
to
keep
the
passover
in
the
second
2Chr30:3
For
they
could
not
keep
it
at
that
because
the
priests
had
not
sanctified
themselves
neither
had
the
p
eople
gathered
themselves
together
to
2Chr30:4
And
the
thing
pleased
the
king
and
all
the
2Chr30:5
So
they
established
a
decree
to
make
proclamation
throughout
all
from
Beersheba
even
to
that
they
should
come
to
keep
the
passover
unto
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
at
for
they
had
not
done
it
of
a
long
time
in
such
sort
as
it
was
writ
2Chr30:6
So
the
posts
went
with
the
letters
from
the
king
and
his
princes
throughout
all
Israel
and
and
according
to
the
com
mandment
of
the
Ye
children
of
turn
again
unto
the
LORD
God
of
and
and
he
will
return
to
the
remnant
of
that
are
escaped
out
of
the
hand
of
the
kings
of
2Chr30:7
And
be
not
ye
like
your
and
like
your
which
trespassed
against
the
LORD
God
of
their
who
there
fore
gave
them
up
to
as
ye
2Chr30:8
Now
be
ye
not
stiffnecked,
as
your
fathers
but
yield
yourselves
unto
the
and
enter
into
his
which
h
e
hath
sanctified
for
and
serve
the
LORD
your
that
the
fierceness
of
his
wrath
may
turn
away
from
2Chr30:9
For
if
ye
turn
again
unto
the
your
brethren
and
your
children
shall
find
compassion
before
them
that
lead
them
capti
ve,
so
that
they
shall
come
again
into
this
for
the
LORD
your
God
is
gracious
and
and
will
not
turn
away
his
face
f
rom
if
ye
return
unto
2Chr30:10
So
the
posts
passed
from
city
to
city
through
the
country
of
Ephraim
and
Manasseh
even
unto
but
they
laughed
the
m
to
and
mocked
2Chr30:11
Nevertheless
divers
of
Asher
and
Manasseh
and
of
Zebulun
humbled
and
came
to
2Chr30:12
Also
in
Judah
the
hand
of
God
was
to
give
them
one
heart
to
do
the
commandment
of
the
king
and
of
the
by
the
wor
d
of
the
2Chr30:13
And
there
assembled
at
Jerusalem
much
people
to
keep
the
feast
of
unleavened
bread
in
the
second
a
very
great
cong
regation.
2Chr30:14
And
they
arose
and
took
away
the
altars
that
were
in
and
all
the
altars
for
incense
took
they
and
cast
t
hem
into
the
brook
2Chr30:15
Then
they
killed
the
passover
on
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
second
and
the
priests
and
the
Levites
were
an
d
sanctified
and
brought
in
the
burnt
offerings
into
the
house
of
the
2Chr30:16
And
they
stood
in
their
place
after
their
according
to
the
law
of
Moses
the
man
of
the
priests
sprinkled
the
which
they
received
of
the
hand
of
the
Levites.
2Chr30:17
For
there
were
many
in
the
congregation
that
were
not
therefore
the
Levites
had
the
charge
of
the
killing
of
the
passovers
for
every
one
that
was
not
to
sanctify
them
unto
the
2Chr30:18
For
a
multitude
of
the
even
many
of
and
and
had
not
cleansed
ye
t
did
they
eat
the
passover
otherwise
than
it
was
But
Hezekiah
prayed
for
The
good
LORD
pardon
every
one
2Chr30:19
That
prepareth
his
heart
to
seek
the
LORD
God
of
his
though
he
be
not
cleansed
according
to
the
purificatio
n
of
the
2Chr30:20
And
the
LORD
hearkened
to
and
healed
the
2Chr30:21
And
the
children
of
Israel
that
were
present
at
Jerusalem
kept
the
feast
of
unleavened
bread
seven
days
with
great
gladne
ss:
and
the
Levites
and
the
priests
praised
the
LORD
day
by
singing
with
loud
instruments
unto
the
2Chr30:22
And
Hezekiah
spake
comfortably
unto
all
the
Levites
that
taught
the
good
knowledge
of
the
and
they
did
eat
througho
ut
the
feast
seven
offering
peace
and
making
confession
to
the
LORD
God
of
their
2Chr30:23
And
the
whole
assembly
took
counsel
to
keep
other
seven
and
they
kept
other
seven
days
with
2Chr30:24
For
Hezekiah
king
of
Judah
did
give
to
the
congregation
a
thousand
bullocks
and
seven
thousand
and
the
princes
gav
e
to
the
congregation
a
thousand
bullocks
and
ten
thousand
and
a
great
number
of
priests
sanctified
2Chr30:25
And
all
the
congregation

and
the
Levites,
and
all
the

that
came
out
of
an

the
strangers
that
came
out
of
the
land
of
and
that
dwelt
in
2Chr30:26
So
there
was
great
joy
in
for
since
the
time
of
Solomon
the
son
of
David
king
of
Israel
there
was
not
the
like
in
2Chr30:27
Then
the
priests

Levites
arose
and
blessed
the
and
their
voice
was
and
their
prayer
came
up
to
his
hol

even
unto

Now
when
all
this
was
all
Israel
that
were
present
went
out
to
the
cities
of
and
brake
the
images
in
piec

and
the
altars
out
of
all

and
in

also
and

Then
all

And
Hezekiah
appointed

And
when

Then
Hezekiah
questioned

And
Azariah

2Chr31:20
And
thus
did
Hezekiah
throughout
all
and
wrought
that
which
was
good
and
right
and
truth
before
the
LORD
his
2Chr31:21
And
in

After

king
of
Assyria
and
entered
into

encamped
against
the
fenced

thought
to
win

And
when
Hezekiah
saw
that
Sennacherib
was
and
that
he
was
purposed
to
fight
against
2Chr32:3
He
took
counsel
with
his
princes
and
his
mighty
men
to
stop
the
waters
of
the
fountains
which
were
without

and
t

did
help
2Chr32:4
So
there
was
gathered
much

who
stopped

that
ran
through

Why
should

Also
he
strengthened
and
built
up
all
the
wall
that
was
and
raised
it
up
to
the
and
another
wall
and
repaired
Millo
in
the
city
of
and
made
darts
and
shields
in
2Chr32:6
And
he
set
captains
of
war
over

gathered
them
together
to
him
in
the
street
of
the
gate
of

And
the
people
rested
t
hemselves
upon
the
words
of
Hezekiah
king
of
2Chr32:9
After
this
did
Sennacherib
king
of
Assyria
send
his
servants
to
(but
he
himself
laid
siege
against
Lachish,
and
all
his
power
with
him,)
unto
Hezekiah
king
of
and
unto
all
Judah
that
were
at
2Chr32:10
Thus
saith
Sennacherib
king
of
Whereon
do
ye
that
ye
abide
in
the
siege
in
2Chr32:11
Doth
not
Hezekiah
persuade
you
to
give
over
yourselves
to
die
by
famine
and
by
The
LORD
our
God
shall
del
iver
us
out
of
the
hand
of
the
king
of
2Chr32:12
Hath
not
the
same
Hezekiah
taken
away
his
high
places
and
his
and
commanded
Judah
and
Ye
shall
worship
before
one
and
burn
incense
upon

Know
ye
not
what
I
and
my
fathers
have
done
unto
all
the
people
of

were
the
gods
of
the
nations
of
those
lan
ds
any
ways
able
to
deliver

out

2Chr32:14
Who
was
there
among
all
the
gods
of
those
nations
that
my
fathers
utterly
that
could
deliver
his
people
out
of
mine
that
your
God
should
be
able
to
deliver
you
out
of
mine
2Chr32:15
Now
therefore
let
not
Hezekiah
deceive
nor
persuade
you
on
this
neither
yet
believe
for
no
god
of
any
n
ation
or
kingdom
was
able
to
deliver
his
people
out
of
mine
and
out
of
the
hand
of

how
much
less
shall
your
God
d
eliver
you
out
of
mine
2Chr32:16
And
his
servants
spake
yet
more
against
the
LORD
and
against
his
servant
2Chr32:17
He
wrote
also
letters
to
rail
on
the
LORD
God
of
and
to
speak
against
As
the
gods
of
the
nations
of
other
lands
have
not
delivered
their
people
out
of
mine
so
shall
not
the
God
of
Hezekiah
deliver
his
people
out
of
mine
2Chr32:18
Then
they
cried
with
a
loud
voice
in
the
speech
unto
the
people
of
Jerusalem
that
were
on
the
to
affright
the
m,
and
to
trouble
that
they
might
take
the
2Chr32:19
And
they
spake
against
the
God
of
as
against
the
gods
of
the
people
of
the
which
were
the
work
of
the
h
ands
of
2Chr32:20
And
for
this
cause
Hezekiah
the
and
the
prophet
Isaiah
the
son
of
Amoz,
prayed
and
cried
to
2Chr32:21
And
the
LORD
sent
an
which
cut
off
all
the
mighty
men
of
and
the
leaders
and
captains
in
the
camp
of
the
k

of
So
he
returned
with
shame
of
face
to
his
own
And
when
he
was
come
into
the
house
of
his
they
that
came
f
orth
of
his
own
bowels
slew
him
there
with
the
2Chr32:22
Thus
the
LORD
saved
Hezekiah
and
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
from
the
hand
of
Sennacherib
the
king
of
and
from
the
hand
of
all
and
guided
them
on
every

And
many
brought
gifts
unto
the
LORD
to
and
presents
to
Hezekiah
king
of
so
that
he
was
magnified
in
th
e
sight
of
all
nations
from
2Chr32:24
In
those
days
Hezekiah
was
sick
to
the
and
prayed
unto
the
and
he
spake
unto
and
he
gave
him
a

But
Hezekiah
rendered
not
again
according
to
the
benefit
done
unto
for
his
heart
was
lifted
therefore
there
was
wrath
upon
and
upon
Judah
and
2Chr32:26
Notwithstanding
Hezekiah
humbled
himself
for
the
pride
of
his
both
he
and
the
inhabitants
of
so
that
th
e
wrath
of
the
LORD
came
not
upon
them
in
the
days
of
2Chr32:27
And
Hezekiah
had
exceeding
much
riches
and
and
he
made
himself
treasuries
for
and
for
and
for
preci
ous
and
for
and
for
and
for
all
manner
of
pleasant
2Chr32:28
Storehouses
also
for
the
increase
of
and
and
and
stalls
for
all
manner
of
and
cotes
for
2Chr32:29
Moreover
he
provided
him
and
possessions
of
flocks
and
herds
in
for
God
had
given
him
substance
very
m
uch.
2Chr32:30
This
same
Hezekiah
also
stopped
the
upper
watercourse
of
Gihon,
and
brought
it
straight
down
to
the
west
side
of
the
city
of
And
Hezekiah
prospered
in
all
his
2Chr32:31
Howbeit
in
the
business
of
the
ambassadors
of
the
princes
of
who
sent
unto
him
to
enquire
of
the
wonder
that
was
done
in
the
God
left
to
try
that
he
might
know
all
that
was
in

Now
the
rest

the
acts

are
written
in

vision
of
Isaiah

son
of
Amoz,
and
in
the
book
of
the
kings
of
Judah
and
2Chr32:33
And
Hezekiah
slept
with
his
and
they
buried
him
in
the
chiefest
of
the
sepulchres
of
the
sons
of
and
all
Judah
and
the
inhabitants

And
Manasseh
his

reigned
in

2Chr33:1
Manasseh
was
twelve
years
old
when
he
began
to
and
he
reigned
fifty
and
five
years
in
2Chr33:2
But
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
like
unto
the
abominations
of
the
whom
the
LORD
had
cast
ou
t
before
the
children
of
2Chr33:3
For
he
built
again
the
high
places
which
Hezekiah
his
father
had
broken
and
he
reared
up
altars
for
Baalim,
and
made
and
worshipped
all
the
host
of
and
served
2Chr33:4
Also
he
built
altars
in
the
house
of
the
whereof
the
LORD
had
In
Jerusalem
shall
my
name
be
for
2Chr33:5
And
he
built
altars
for
all
the
host
of
heaven
in
the
two
courts
of
the
house
of
the
2Chr33:6
And
he
caused
his
children
to
pass
through
the
fire
in
the
valley
of
the
son
of
Hinnom:
also
he
observed
and
used
e
nchantments,
and
used
and
dealt
with
a
familiar
and
with
he
wrought
much
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
LORD
,
to
provoke
him
to
2Chr33:7
And
he
set
a
carved
the
idol
which
he
had
in
the
house
of
of
which
God
had
said
to
David
and
to
Solomon
his
In
this
and
in
which
I
have
chosen
before
all
the
tribes
of
will
I
put
my
name
for

Neither
will
I
any
more
remove
the
foot
of
Israel
from
out
of
the
land
which
I
have
appointed
for
your

that
th

will
take
heed
to
do
all
that
I
have
commanded
according
to
the
whole
law
and
the
statutes
and
the
ordinances
by
the
hand
of
2Chr33:9
So
Manasseh
made
Judah
and
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
to
and
to
do
worse
than
the
whom
the
LORD
had
destro
yed
before
the
children
of
2Chr33:10
And
the
LORD
spake
to
and
to
his
but
they
would
not
2Chr33:11
Wherefore
the
LORD
brought
upon
them
the
captains
of
the
host
of
the
king
of
which
took
Manasseh
among
the
thorn
s,
and
bound
him
with
and
carried
him
to
2Chr33:12
And
when
he
was
in
he
besought
the
LORD
his
and
humbled
himself
greatly
before
the
God
of
his
2Chr33:13
And
prayed
unto
and
he
was
intreated
of
and
heard
his
and
brought
him
again
to
Jerusalem
into

Then
Manasseh
knew
that
the
LORD
he
was

Now
after
this
he
built
a
wall
without

city
of
on
the
west
side
of
Gihon,
in
the

to
the
entering
in
at
the
fish
and
compassed
about
Ophel,
and
raised
it
up
a
very
great
and
put
captains
of
war
in
all
the
fenced
cit
ies
of
2Chr33:15
And
he
took
away
the
strange
and
the
idol
out
of
the
house
of
the
and
all
the
altars
that
he
had
built
in
the
mount
of
the
house
of
the
and
in
and
cast
them
out
of
the
2Chr33:16
And
he
repaired
the
altar
of
the
and
sacrificed
thereon
peace
offerings
and
thank
and
commanded
Judah
to
serve
the
LORD
God
of
2Chr33:17
Nevertheless
the
people
did
sacrifice
still
in
the
high
yet
unto
the
LORD
their
God
2Chr33:18
Now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
and
his
prayer
unto
his
and
the
words
of
the
seers
that
spake
to
him
in
the
na

of
the
LORD
God
of
they
are
written
in
the
book
of
the
kings
of
2Chr33:19
His
prayer
and
how
God
was
intreated
of
and
all
his
and
his
and
the
places
wherein
he
built
hi

and
set
up
groves
and
graven
before
he
was
they
are
written
among
the
sayings
of
the
2Chr33:20
So
Manasseh
slept
with
his
and
they
buried
him
in
his
own

Amon
his
son
reigned
in
his
2Chr33:21
Amon
was
two
and
twenty
years
old
when
he
began
to
and
reigned
two
years
in
2Chr33:22
But
he
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
as
did
Manasseh
his
for
Amon
sacrificed
unto
all
the
car
ved
images
which
Manasseh
his
father
had
and
served
2Chr33:23
And
humbled
not
himself
before
the
as
Manasseh
his
father
had
humbled
but
Amon
trespassed
more
and
2Chr33:24
And
his
servants
conspired
against
and
slew
him
in
his
own
2Chr33:25
But
the
people
of
the
land
slew
all
them
that
had
conspired
against
king
and
the
people
of
the
land
made
Josiah
his
son

Josiah
was
eight
years
old
when
he
began

he
reigned
in
Jerusalem
one
and
thirty

And
he
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
and
walked
in
the
ways
of
David
his
and
declined
neither
to

right

For
in
the
eighth
year
of
his
while
he
was
yet
he
began
to
seek
after
the
God
of
David
his
and
in
th
e
twelfth
year
he
began
to
purge
Judah
and
Jerusalem
from
the
high
and
the
and
the
carved
and
the
molten

2Chr34:4
And
they
brake
down
the
altars
of
Baalim
in
his
and
the
that
were
on
high
above
he
cut
and
t
he
and
the
carved
and
the
molten

brake
in
and
made
dust
of
and
strowed
it
upon
the
graves
of
them
that
had
sacrificed
unto
2Chr34:5
And
he
burnt
the
bones
of
the
priests
upon
their
and
cleansed
Judah
and
2Chr34:6
And
so
did
he
in
the
cities
of
and
and
even
unto
with
their
mattocks
round
2Chr34:7
And
when
he
had
broken
down
the
altars
and
the
and
had
beaten
the
graven
images
into
and
cut
down
all
the
idols
throughout
all

land
of

returned
to

Now
in
the
eighteenth
year
of
his
when
he
had
purged

sent
Shaphan

And
when
they
came
to
Hilkiah
the
high
they
delivered
the
money
that
was
brought
into
the
house
of
which
the
Levites
that
kept
the
doors
had
gathered
of
the
hand
of
Manasseh
and
and
of
all
the
remnant
of
and
of
all
Judah

d
and
they
returned
to
2Chr34:10
And
they
put
it
in
the
hand
of
the
workmen
that
had
the
oversight
of
the
house
of
the
and
they
gave
it
to

that
wrought
in

house

to
repair

amend

Even
to

builders
gave
they
to
buy
hewn

timber
for

to
floor
the
houses

the
kings
of
Judah
had

And
the
men
did
the
work
and
the
overseers
of
them
were
Jahath
and
the
Levites,
of

sons
of
Merar

Zechariah
and
Meshullam,
of

other
of

Levites,
all
that

Also
they
were
over
the
bearers

were
overseers
of
all
that
wrought
the
work
in
any
manner
of

of

were

And
when
they
brought
out
the
money
that
was
brought
into

house
of

the
priest
found
a
book
of

given
by

And
Hilkiah
answered
and
said
to

And
Shaphan

said
to

His
servants
therefore
took

Now
the

And
the

And
the
king
of
Egypt
made
Eliakim
his
brother
king
over
Judah
and
and
turned
his
name
to
Jehoiakim.
And
Necho
took
Jehoahaz
his
and
carried
him
to

Jehoiakim
was
twenty

five
years
old
when
he

reigned
eleven

he
did
that
which
was

Against
him
came
up
Nebuchadnezzar
king
of

bound
him
in

carry
him
to

Nebuchadnezzar
also
carried
of
the
vessels
of
the
house
of
the
LORD
to

put
them
in
his
temple
at
2Chr36:8
Now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
Jehoiakim,
and
his
abominations
which
he
and
that
which
was
found
in

Jehoiachin
was
eight

ten
days

which
was
evil
in

sight
of

And
when
the
year
was
king
Nebuchadnezzar
and
brought
him
to
with
the
goodly
vessels
of
the
house
of

made
Zedekiah
his

Zedekiah
was
one

twenty
years

eleven
years

And
he
did
that
which
was
evil

the
sight
of
the
LORD
his
and
humbled
not
himself
before
Jeremiah
the
prophet
spea
king
from
the
mouth
of
the
2Chr36:13
And
he
also
rebelled
against
king
who
had
made
him
swear
by
but
he
stiffened
his
and
hardened
his
heart
from
turning
unto
the
LORD
God
of

Moreover
all
the
chief
of

very
much
after
all
the
abominations
of
the

polluted
the
house
of

he
had
hallowed

And
the
LORD

his
rising
up

because
he
had
compassi

they
mocked

misused

Therefore
he
brought
upon
them
the
king
of
the
Chaldees,
who
slew
their
young
men
with
the
sword
in
the
house
of
their
sa

and
had
no
compassion
upon
young
man
or
old
or
him
that
stooped
for
he
gave
them
all
into

burnt
all

And
I

there
abode
we
in
tents
three
and
I
viewed
the

found
there
none

Then
sent

And
I
sent
them
with
commandment
unto
Iddo
the
chief
at
the
place
Casiphia,
and
I
told
them
what
they
should
say
unto
Iddo
,
and
to
his
brethren
the
Nethinims,
at
the
place
Casiphia,
that
they
should
bring
unto
us
ministers
for
the
house
of
our
Ezra8:18
And
by
the
good
hand
of
our
God
upon
us
they
brought
us
a
man
of
of
the
sons
of
Mahli,
the

two
hundred

hinims:
all
of
them
were
expressed
by
Ezra8:21
Then
I
proclaimed
a
fast
at
the
river
of
Ahava,
that
we
might
afflict
ourselves
before
our
to
seek
of
him
a
ri

way
for

for
our
little

for
all

For
I
was
ashamed
to
require
of
the
king
a
band
of
soldiers
and
horsemen
to
help
us
against
the
enemy
in
the
because
we
had
spoken
unto
the
The

them
for
good
that
seek
but
his
power

his
wrath
is
ag

all
them
that
forsake

So
we
fasted
and
besought
our
God
for

he
was
intreated
of

Then
I
separated
twelve

the
chief
of
the
Sherebiah,
Hashabiah,
and
ten
of
their
brethren
with
Ezra8:25
And
weighed
unto

And
when
I
heard
this
I
rent
my
garment
and
my
and
plucked
off
the
hair
of
my
head
and
of
my
and
sat
down
Ezra9:4
Then
were
assembled
unto
me
every
one
that
trembled
at
the
words
of
the
God
of
because
of
the
transgression
of
thos
e
that
had
been
carried
and
I
sat
astonied
until
the
evening
Ezra9:5
And
at
the
evening
sacrifice
I
arose
up
from

having
rent
my
garment
and
my

fell
upon

and
spread
out
my
hands
unto
the
LORD
my
Ezra9:6
And
O
my
I
am
ashamed
and
blush
to
lift
up
my
face
to
my
for
our
iniquities
are
increased
over
our
he
and
our
trespass
is
grown
up
unto
the
Ezra9:7
Since
the
days
of
our
fathers
have
we
been
in
a
great
trespass
unto
this
and
for
our
iniquities
have
our
an
d

been
delivered
into
the
hand
of
the
kings
of
the
to
the
to
and
to
a
and
to
confusion
of
as
it
is
this
Ezra9:8
And
now
for
a
little
space
grace
hath
been
shewed
from
the
LORD
our
to
leave
us
a
remnant
to
and
to
give
us
a
nail
in
his
holy
that
our
God
may
lighten
our
and
give
us
a
little
reviving
in
our
Ezra9:9
For
we
were
bondmen;
yet
our
God
hath
not
forsaken
us
in
our
but
hath
extended
mercy
unto
us
in
the
sight
of
the
k
ings
of
to
give
us
a
to
set
up
the
house
of
our
and
to
repair
the
desolations
and
to
give
us
a
wall
in
Judah
and
in
Ezra9:10
And
O
our
what
shall
we
say
after
for
we
have
forsaken
thy
Ezra9:11
Which
thou
hast
commanded
by
thy
servants
the
The
unto
which
ye
go
to
possess
is
an
unclean
la

with
the
filthiness
of
the
people
of

their
which
have
filled
it
from
one
end
to
another
with
their
Ezra9:12
Now
therefore
give
not
your
daughters
unto
their
neither
take
their
daughters
unto
your
nor
seek
their
peace
o
r
their
wealth
for
that
ye
may
be
and
eat
the
good
of
the
and
leave
it
for
an
inheritance
to
your
children
for
Ezra9:13
And
after
all
that
is
come
upon
us
for
our
evil
and
for
our
great
seeing
that
thou
our
God
hast
punished
us
less
than
our
iniquities
and
hast
given
us
such
deliverance
as
Ezra9:14
Should
we
again
break
thy
and
join
in
affinity
with
the
people
of
these
wouldest
not
thou
be
a
ngry
with
us
till
thou
hadst
consumed
so
that
there
should
be
no
remnant
nor

O
LORD
God
of
thou
art
for
we
remain
yet
as
it
is
this
we
are
before
thee
in
our
for
we
cannot
stand
before
thee
because
of
Ezra10:1
Now
when
Ezra
had
and
when
he
had
weeping
and
casting
himself
down
before
the
house
of

assem
bled
unto
him
out

a

and
for

wept

And
Shechaniah
the
son
of
Jehiel,
one
of
the
sons
of

and
said
unto
We
have
trespassed
against
our

,
and
have
taken
strange
wives
of
the
people
of
the
yet
now
there
is
hope
in
Israel
concerning
this
Ezra10:3
Now
therefore
let
us
make
a
covenant
with
our
God
to
put
away
all
the
and
such
as
are
born
of
according
to
th
e
counsel
of
my
and
of
those
that
tremble
at
the
commandment
of
our
and
let
it
be
done
according
to
the
Ezra10:4
for
this
matter
belongeth
unto
we
also
will
be

Then
arose
and
made

that
they
should
do
according
to
this
w
ord.
And

Then
Ezra
rose
up
from
before
the
house
of

went
into
the
chamber
of
Johanan
the
son
of
Eliashib:
and
when
he
came
he
did
eat
no

drink
for
he
mourned
because
of
the
transgression
of
them
that
had
been
carried

And
they
made
proclamation
throughout
Judah
and
Jerusalem
unto
all
the
children
of

they
should

themselves
together
unto

And
that

would
not
come
within
three
according
to
the
counsel
of

and
the
all
his
subst

should
be
and
himself
separated
from

congregation
of
those
that
had
been
carried

Then
all
the
men
of
Judah
and
Benjamin
gathered
themselves
together
unto
Jerusalem
within

It
was
the
ninth

on
the

sat
in

of
trembling
because
of
this

for

And
Ezra
the

stood
and
said
unto
Ye

of

Now
therefore
make
confession
unto

of

separate
yourselves
from

from

Then
all
the
congregation
answered
and
said
with
a
loud

hast
so
must

But
the

a
time

The
words
of
Nehemiah
the
son
of

And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
month
Chisleu,
in
the
twentieth
as
I
was
in
Shu
shan
the
Neh1:2
That
Hanani,
one
of
my

and
certain
men
of

I
asked
them
concerning
the
Jews
that
had
w
hich
were
left
of

concerning

And
they
said
unto
The
remnant
that
are
left
of
the
captivity
there
in
the
province
are
in
great
affliction
and
reproach
:
the
wall
of
Jerusalem
also
is
broken
and
the
gates
thereof
are
burned
with
Neh1:4
And
it
came
to
when
I
heard
these
that
I
sat
down
and
and
mourned
certain
and
and
prayed
be
fore
the
God
of
Neh1:5
And
I
beseech
O
LORD
God
of
the
great
and
terrible
that
keepeth
covenant
and
mercy
for
them
that
lo
ve
him
and
observe
his
Neh1:6
Let
thine
ear
now
be
and
thine
eyes
that
thou
mayest
hear
the
prayer
of
thy
which
I
pray
before
th
ee
day
and
for
the
children
of
Israel
thy
and
confess
the
sins
of
the
children
of
which
we
have
sinne
d
against
both
I
and
my
father's
house
have
Neh1:7
We
have
dealt
very
corruptly
against

have
not
kept
the
nor
the
nor
the
which
th
ou
commandedst
thy
servant
Neh1:8
I
beseech
the
word
that
thou
commandedst
thy
servant
If
ye
I
will
scatter
you
abr
oad
among
the
Neh1:9
But
if
ye
turn
unto
and
keep
my
and
do
though
there
were
of
you
cast
out
unto
the
uttermost
part
of

will
I
gather
them
from

will
bring
them
unto
the
place
that
I
have
chosen
to
set
my
name

Now
these
are
thy
servants

thy
whom
thou
hast
redeemed
by

O
I
beseech
let
now
thine
ear
be
attentive
to
the
prayer
of
thy
and
to

prayer

thy
who
desire
to
fear
thy
and
I
pray
thy
servant
this
and
grant
him
mercy
in
the
sight
of
this
For
I
was
t
he
king's
Neh2:1
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
month
Nisan,
in
the
twentieth
year
of
Artaxerxes
the
that
wine
was
before
and
I
took
u
p
the
and
gave
it
unto
the
Now
I
had
not
been
beforetime
sad
in
his
Neh2:2
Wherefore
the
king
said
unto
Why
is
thy
countenance
seeing
thou
art
not
this
is
nothing
else
but
sorrow
of
he
Then
I
was
very
sore
Neh2:3
And
said
unto
the
Let
the
king
live
for
why
should
not
my
countenance
be
when
the
the
place
of
my
fat
lieth
and
the
gates
thereof
are
consumed
with
Neh2:4
Then
the
king
said
unto
For
what
dost
thou
make
So
I
prayed
to
the
God
of
Neh2:5
And
I
said
unto
the
If
it
please
the
and
if
thy
servant
have
found
favour
in
thy
that
thou
wouldest
send
me
unto
unto
the
city
of
my
that
I
may
build
Neh2:6
And
the
king
said
unto
(the
queen
also
sitting
by
him,)
For
how
long
shall
thy
journey
and
when
wilt
thou
So
it
pleased
the
king
to
send
and
I
set
him
a
Neh2:7
Moreover
I
said
unto
the
If
it
please
the
let
letters
be
given
me
to
the
governors
beyond
the
that
they
m
ay
convey
me
over
till
I
come
into
Neh2:8
And
a
letter
unto
Asaph
the
keeper
of
the
king's
that
he
may
give
me
timber
to
make
beams
for
the
gates
of
the
palac
e
which
appertained
to
the
and
for
the
wall
of
the
and
for
the
house
that
I
shall
enter
And
the
king
granted
according
to
the
good
hand
of
my
God
upon
Neh2:9
Then
I
came
to
the
governors
beyond
the
and
gave
them
the
king's
Now
the
king
had
sent
captains
of
the
army
and
horsemen
with
Neh2:10
When
Sanballat
the
Horonite,
and
Tobiah
the
the
heard
of
it
grieved
them
exceedingly
that
there
was
come
a
man
to
seek
the
welfare
of
the
children
of
Neh2:11
So
I
came
to
and
was
there
three
Neh2:12
And
I
arose
in
the
I
and
some
few
men
with
neither
told
I
any
man
what
my
God
had
put
in
my
heart
to
do
at
Jerus
alem:
neither
was
there
any
beast
with
save
the
beast
that
I
rode
Neh2:13
And
I
went
out
by
night
by
the
gate
of
the
even
before
the
dragon
and
to
the
dung
and
viewed
the
walls
of
which
were
broken
and
the
gates
thereof
were
consumed
with
Neh2:14
Then
I
went
on
to

great
and
mocke
d

O
our

we

turn
their
reproach
upon

in

of

aptivity:
Neh4:5
And
cover
not

let
not
their
sin
be
blotted
out
from

they
have
provoked
thee
to
anger
be
fore
the
Neh4:6
So
built
we
the
and
all
the
wall
was
joined
together
unto
the
half
for
the
people
had
a
mind
to
Neh4:7
But
it
came
to
that
when
Sanballat,
and
Tobiah,
and
the
and
the
and
the
Ashdodites,
heard
that
th
e
walls
of
Jerusalem
were
made
and
that
the
breaches
began
to
be
then
they
were
very
Neh4:8
And
conspired
all
of
them
together
to
come
and
to
fight
against
and
to
hinder
Neh4:9
Nevertheless
we
made
our
prayer
unto
our
and
set
a
watch
against
them
day
and
because
of
Neh4:10
And
Judah
The
strength
of
the
bearers
of
burdens
is
and
there
is
much
so
that
we
are
not
able
to
bu
ild
the
Neh4:11
And
our
adversaries
They
shall
not
neither
till
we
come
in
the
midst
among
and
slay
and
cause
the
work
to
Neh4:12
And
it
came
to
that
when
the
Jews
which
dwelt
by
them
they
said
unto
us
ten
From
all
places
whence
ye
sh
all
return
unto
us
they
will
be
upon
Neh4:13
Therefore
set
I
in
the
lower
places
behind
the
and
on
the
higher
I
even
set
the
people
after
their
families
w
ith
their
their
and
their
Neh4:14
And
I
and
rose
and
said
unto
the
and
to
the
and
to
the
rest
of
the
Be
not
ye
afraid
of
remember
the
which
is
great
and
and
fight
for
your
your
and
your
your
and
y
our
Neh4:15
And
it
came
to
when
our
enemies
heard
that
it
was
known
unto
and
God
had
brought
their
counsel
to
that
we
returned
all
of
us
to
the
every
one
unto
his
Neh4:16
And
it
came
to
pass
from
that
time
that
the
half
of
my
servants
wrought
in
the
and
the
other
half
of
them
held
both
the
the
and
the
and
the
habergeons;
and
the
rulers
were
behind
all
the
house
of
Neh4:17
They

builded
on

they
that
bare
with
those
that
every
one
with
one
of
his
hands
wrought
in
the

with
the
other
hand
held
a
Neh4:18
For
the
every
one
had
his
sword
girded
by
his
and
so
And
he
that
sounded
the
trumpet
was
by
Neh4:19
And
I
said
unto
the
and
to
the
and
to
the
rest
of
the
The
work
is
great
and
and
we
are
separ
ated
upon
the
one
far
from
Neh4:20
In
what
place
therefore
ye
hear
the
sound
of
the
resort
ye
thither
unto
our
God
shall
fight
for
Neh4:21
So
we
laboured
in
the
and
half
of
them
held
the
spears
from
the
rising
of
the
morning
till
the
stars
Neh4:22
Likewise
at
the
same
time
said
I
unto
the
Let
every
one
with
his
servant
lodge
within
that
in
the
night
they
may
be
a
guard
to
and
labour
on
the
Neh4:23
So
neither
nor
my
nor
my
nor
the
men
of
the
guard
which
followed
none
of
us
put
off
our
saving
that
every
one
put
them
off
for
Neh5:1
And
there
was
a
great
cry
of
the
people
and
of
their
wives
against
their
brethren
the
Neh5:2
For
there
were
that
our
and
our
are
therefore
we
take
up
corn
for
that
we
may
an
d
Neh5:3
Some
also
there
were
that
We
have
mortgaged
our
and
that
we
might
buy
because
of
the
d
Neh5:4
There
were
also
that
We
have
borrowed
money
for
the
king's
and
that
upon
our
lands
and
Neh5:5
Yet
now
our
flesh
is
as
the
flesh
of
our
our
children
as
their
we
bring
into
bondage
our
sons
a
nd
our
daughters
to
be
and
some
of
our
daughters
are
brought
unto
bondage
neither
is
it
in
our
power
to
redeem
t
for
other
men
have
our
lands
and
Neh5:6
And
I
was
very
angry
when
I
heard
their
cry
and
these
Neh5:7
Then
I
consulted
with
and
I
rebuked
the
and
the
and
said
unto
Ye
exact
every
one
of
his
And
I
set
a
great
assembly
against
Neh5:8
And
I
said
unto
We
after
our
ability
have
redeemed
our
brethren
the
which
were
sold
unto
the
and
will
y
e
even
sell
your
or
shall
they
be
sold
unto
Then
held
they
their
and
found
nothing
to
Neh5:9
Also
I
It
is
not
good
that
ye
ought
ye
not
to
walk
in
the
fear
of
our
God
because
of
the
reproach
of
the
heathen
o
ur
Neh5:10
I
and
my
and
my
might
exact
of
them
money
and
I
pray
let
us
leave
off
this
Neh5:11
I
pray
to
even
this

their
their
oliveyards,
and
their
also
the
hun
dredth
part
of
the
and
of
the

and
the
that
ye
exact
of
Neh5:12
Then
said
We
will
restore
and
will
require
nothing
of
so
will
we
do
as
thou
sayest.
Then
I
called
the
pri
ests,
and
took
an
oath
of
that
they
should
do
according
to
this
Neh5:13
Also
I
shook
my
and
So
God
shake
out
every
man
from
his
and
from
his
that
performeth
not

pro

thus

shaken
and
And
all
the
congregation
and
praised
the
And
the
people
did
accord

to
this
Neh5:14
Moreover
from
the
time
that
I
was
appointed
to
be
their
governor
in
the
land
of
from
the
twentieth
year
even
unto
th

two
and
thirtieth

of
Artaxerxes
the
that
twelve
I
and
my
brethren
have
not
eaten
the
bread
of
the
Neh5:15
But
the
former
governors
that
had
been
before
me
were
chargeable
unto
the
and
had
taken
of
them
bread
and
bes
ide
forty
shekels
of
even
their
servants
bare
rule
over
the
but
so
did
not
because
of
the
fear
of
Neh5:16
also
I
continued
in
the
work
of
this
neither
bought
we
any
and
all
my
servants
were
gathered
thither
unto
the
Neh5:17
Moreover
there
were
at
my
table
an
hundred
and
fifty
of
the
Jews
and
beside
those
that
came
unto
us
from
among
the
heathen
that
are
about
Neh5:18
Now
that
which
was
prepared
for
me
daily
was
one
ox
and
six
choice
also
fowls
were
prepared
for
and
once
in
ten
days
store
of
all
sorts
of
yet
for
all
this
required
not
I
the
bread
of
the
because
the
bondage
was
heavy
upon
this
Neh5:19
Think
upon
my
for
according
to
all
that
I
have
done
for
this
Neh6:1
Now
it
came
to
when
Sanballat,
and
Tobiah,
and
Geshem
the
and
the
rest
of
our
heard
that
I
had
build
ed
the
and
that
there
was
no
breach
left
(though
at
that
time
I
had
not
set
up
the
doors
upon
the
gates;)
Neh6:2
That
Sanballat
and
Geshem
sent
unto
let
us
meet
together
in
some
one
of
the
villages
in
the
plain
of
Ono.
But
they
thought
to
do
me
Neh6:3
And
I
sent
messengers
unto
I
am
doing
a
great
so
that
I
cannot
come
why
should
the
work
whi
lst
I
leave
and
come
down
to
Neh6:4
Yet
they
sent
unto
me
four
times
after
this
and
I
answered
them
after
the
same
Neh6:5
Then
sent
Sanballat
his
servant
unto
me
in
like
manner
the
fifth
time
with
an
open
letter
in
his
Neh6:6
Wherein
was
It
is
reported
among
the
and
Gashmu
saith
that
thou
and
the
Jews
think
to

which
cause
thou
buildest

thou
mayest

Neh6:7
And
thou
hast
also
appointed
prophets
to
preach
of
thee
at
There
is
a
king
in

now
shall
it
be
reported
to
the
king
according
to
these
Come
now
and
let
us
take
counsel
Neh6:8
Then
I
sent
unto
There
are
no
such
things
done
as
thou
sayest,
but
thou
feignest
them
out
of
thine
own
Neh6:9
For
they
all
made
us
Their
hands
shall
be
weakened
from
the
that

not
Now
O
strengthen
my
Neh6:10
Afterward
I
came
unto
the
house
of
Shemaiah
the
son
of
Delaiah
the
son
of
Mehetabeel,
who
was
shut
and
he
Let
us
meet
together
in
the
house
of
within
the
and
let
us
shut
the
doors
of
the
for
they
will
come
to
slay
yea
,
in
the
night
will
they
come
to
slay
Neh6:11
And
I
Should
such
a
man
as
I
and
who
is
being
as
I
would
go
into
the
temple
to
save
his
I
will
not
go
Neh6:12
I
perceived
that
God
had
not
sent
but
that
he
pronounced
this
prophecy
against
for
Tobiah
and
Sanballat
h
ad
hired
Neh6:13
Therefore
was
he
that
I
should
be
and
do
and
and
that
they
might
have
matter
for
an
evil
th
at
they
might
reproach
Neh6:14
My
think
thou
upon
Tobiah
and
Sanballat
according
to
these
their
and
on
the
prophetess
Noadiah,
and
the
rest
of
the
that
would
have
put
me
in
Neh6:15
So
the
wall
was
finished
in
the
twenty
and
fifth
day
of
the
month
Elul,
in
fifty
and
two
Neh6:16
And
it
came
to
that
when
all
our
enemies
heard
and
all
the
heathen
that
were
about
us
saw
these
they
were
much
cast
down
in
their
own
for
they
perceived
that
this
work
was
wrought
of
our
Neh6:17
Moreover
in
those
days
the
nobles
of
Judah
sent
many
letters
unto
Tobiah,
and
the
letters
of
Tobiah
came
unto
Neh6:18
For
there
were
many
in
Judah
sworn
unto
because
he
was
the
son
in
law
of
Shechaniah
the
son
of
Arah;
and
his
son
Johan
an
had
taken
the
daughter
of
Meshullam
the
son
of
Berechiah.
Neh6:19
Also
they
reported
his
good
deeds
before
and
uttered
my
words
to
And
Tobiah
sent
letters
to
put
me
in
Neh7:1
Now
it
came
to
when
the
wall
was
and
I
had
set
up
the
and
the
porters
and
the
singers
and
the
Levites
we
re
Neh7:2
That
I
gave
my
brother
Hanani,
and
Hananiah
the
ruler
of
the
charge
over
for
he
was
a
faithful
and
f
eared
God
above
Neh7:3
And
I
said
unto
Let
not
the
gates
of
Jerusalem
be
opened
until
the
sun
be
and
while
they
stand
let
them
shut
the

appoint
watches
of
the
inhabitants

every
one
in
his

every

Neh7:4
Now
the
city
was
large
and
but
the
people
were
few
and
the
houses
were
not
Neh7:5
And
my
God
put
into
mine
heart
to
gather
together
the
and
the
and
the
that
they
might
be
reckoned
by
And
I
found
a

their

Moreover

And
madest

But
they
and

hearkened
not

And
refused
to

hardened

in

appointed

thou
art

ready
to

and
slow

,
and
of
great
and
forsookest
them
Neh9:18
when
they
had
made
them
a
molten
and
This
is
thy
God
that
brought
thee
up
out
of

had
wrought
gr

Neh9:19
Yet
thou
in
thy
manifold

forsookest
them
not
in

departed
not
from

by

the
way
wherein

Thou
gavest

thy
good
spirit
to

withheldest
not
thy
manna
from

and
gavest
them
water
fo

their
Neh9:21
forty
years
didst
thou
sustain
them
in
the
so
that
they
lacked
their
clothes
waxed
not
and
t
heir
feet
swelled
Neh9:22
Moreover
thou
gavest
them
kingdoms
and
and
didst
divide
them
into
so
they
possessed
the
land
of
Sihon,
an
d
the
land
of
the
king
of
Heshbon,
and
the
land
of
Og
king
of

Their
children
also
multipliedst
thou
as
the
stars
of

broughtest
them
into
the

which
thou
hads
t
promised
to
their
that
they
should
go
in
to
possess
Neh9:24
So
the
children
went
in
and
possessed
the
and
thou
subduedst
before
them
the
inhabitants
of
the
the
Canaanites,
and
gavest
them
into
their
with
their
and
the
people
of
the
that
they
might
do
with
them
as

Neh9:25
And
they
took
strong
and
a
fat
and
possessed
houses
full
of
all
wells
and
oliveyard
s,
and
fruit
trees
in
so
they
did
and
were
and
became
and
delighted
themselves
in
thy
great
Neh9:26
Nevertheless
they
were
and
rebelled
against
and
cast
thy
law
behind
their
and
slew
thy
prophets
w
hich
testified
against
them
to
turn
them
to
and
they
wrought
great
Neh9:27
Therefore
thou
deliveredst
them
into
the
hand
of
their
who
vexed
and
in
the
time
of
their
when
they
cried
unto
thou
heardest
them
from
and
according
to
thy
manifold
mercies
thou
gavest
them
who
saved
them
o
ut
of
the
hand
of
their
Neh9:28
But
after
they
had
they
did
evil
again
before
therefore
leftest
thou
them
in
the
hand
of
their
so
that
they
had
the
dominion
over

when
they
and
cried
unto
thou
heardest
them
from
and
many
times
didst
thou
deliver
them
according
to
thy
Neh9:29
And
testifiedst
against
that
thou
mightest
bring
them
again
unto
thy
yet
they
dealt
and
hearkened
not
u
nto
thy
but
sinned
against
thy
(which
if
a
man
he
shall
live
in
them;)
and
withdrew
the
and
hardened
their
and
would
not
Neh9:30
Yet
many
years
didst
thou
forbear
and
testifiedst
against
them
by
thy
spirit
in
thy
yet
would
they
not
give
therefore
gavest
thou
them
into
the
hand
of
the
people
of
the
Neh9:31
Nevertheless
for
thy
great
sake
thou
didst
not
utterly
consume
nor
forsake
for
thou
art
a
gracious

merciful
Neh9:32
Now
our
the

Howbeit
thou

great
goodness
that

great
the
wives

d
the
children
so
that
the
joy
of
Jerusalem
was
heard
even
afar
Neh12:44
And
at
that
time
were
some
appointed
over
the
chambers
for
the
for
the
for
the
and
for
the
to
gather
into
them
out
of
the
fields
of
the
cities
the
portions
of
the
law
for
the
priests
and
Levites:
for
Judah
rejo
iced
for
the
priests
and
for
the
Levites
that
Neh12:45
And
both
the
singers
and
the
porters
kept
the
ward
of
their
and
the
ward
of
the
according
to
the
comman
dment
of
and
of
Solomon
his
Neh12:46
For
in
the
days
of
David
and
Asaph
of
old
there
were
chief
of
the
and
songs
of
praise
and
thanksgiving
unto
Neh12:47
And
all
Israel
in
the
days
of
Zerubbabel,
and
in
the
days
of
gave
the
portions
of
the
singers
and
the
e
very
day
his
and
they
sanctified
holy
things
unto
the
Levites;
and
the
Levites
sanctified
them
unto
the
children
of
Neh13:1
On
that
day
they
read
in
the
book
of
Moses
in
the
audience
of
the
and
therein
was
found
that
the
Ammonite
and
the
Moabite
should
not
come
into
the
congregation
of
God
for
Neh13:2
Because
they
met
not
the
children
of
Israel
with
bread
and
with
but
hired
Balaam
against
that
he
should
curse
howbeit
our
God
turned
the
curse
into
a
Neh13:3
Now
it
came
to
when
they
had
heard
the
that
they
separated
from
Israel
all
the
mixed
Neh13:4
And
before
Eliashib
the
having
the
oversight
of
the
chamber
of
the
house
of
our
was
allied
unto
Tobiah:
Neh13:5
And
he
had
prepared
for
him
a
great
where
aforetime
they
laid
the
meat
the
and
the
vessel
s,
and
the
tithes
of
the
the
new
and
the
which
was
commanded
to
be
given
to
the
Levites,
and
the
and
the
and
the
offerings
of
the
Neh13:6
But
in
all
this
time
was
not
I
at
for
in
the
two
and
thirtieth
year
of
Artaxerxes
king
of
Babylon
came
I
unto
th
e
and
after
certain
days
obtained
I
leave
of
the
Neh13:7
And
I
came
to
and
understood
of
the
evil
that
Eliashib
did
for
Tobiah,
in
preparing
him
a
chamber
in
the
courts
of
the
house
of
Neh13:8
And
it
grieved
me
therefore
I
cast
forth
all
the
household
stuff
of
Tobiah
out
of
the
Neh13:9
Then
I
and
they
cleansed
the
and
thither
brought
I
again
the
vessels
of
the
house
of
with
the
mea
t
offering
and
the
Neh13:10
And
I
perceived
that
the
portions
of
the
Levites
had
not
been
given
for
the
Levites
and
the
that
did
the
wo
rk,
were
fled
every
one
to
his
Neh13:11
Then
contended
I
with
the
and
Why
is
the
house
of
God
And
I
gathered
them
and
set
them
i
n
their
Neh13:12
Then
brought
all
Judah
the
tithe
of
the
corn
and
the
new
wine
and
the
oil
unto
the
Neh13:13
And
I
made
treasurers
over
the
Shelemiah
the
and
Zadok
the
and
of
the
Levites,
Pedaiah:
and
ne
xt
to
them
was
Hanan
the
son
of
Zaccur,
the
son
of
Mattaniah:
for
they
were
counted
and
their
office
was
to
distribute
un
to
their
Neh13:14
Remember
O
my
concerning
and
wipe
not
out
my
good
deeds
that
I
have
done
for
the
house
of
my
and
for
t
he
offices
Neh13:15
In
those
days
saw
I
in
Judah
some
treading
wine
presses
on
the
and
bringing
in
and
lading
as
also
and
and
all
manner
of
which
they
brought
into
Jerusalem
on
the
sabbath
and
I
testified
against
t
hem
in
the
day
wherein
they
sold
Neh13:16
There
dwelt
men
of
Tyre
also
which
brought
and
all
manner
of
and
sold
on
the
sabbath
unto
the
childre
n
of
and
in
Neh13:17
Then
I
contended
with
the
nobles
of
and
said
unto
What
evil
thing
is
this
that
ye
and
profane
the
sabbath
Neh13:18
Did
not
your
fathers
and
did
not
our
God
bring
all
this
evil
upon
and
upon
this
yet
ye
bring
more
wrath
up
on
Israel
by
profaning
the
Neh13:19
And
it
came
to
that
when
the
gates
of
Jerusalem
began
to
be
dark
before
the
I
commanded
that
the
gates
shou
ld
be
and
charged
that
they
should
not
be
opened
till
after
the
and
some
of
my
servants
set
I
at
the
that
the
re
should
no
burden
be
brought
in
on
the
sabbath
Neh13:20
So
the
merchants
and
sellers
of
all
kind
of
ware
lodged
without
Jerusalem
once
or
Neh13:21
Then
I
testified
against
and
said
unto
Why
lodge
ye
about
the
if
ye
do
so
I
will
lay
hands
on
you
.
From
that
time
forth
came
they
no
more
on
the
Neh13:22
And
I
commanded
the
Levites
that
they
should
cleanse
and
that
they
should
come
and
keep
the
to
sanctify
the
sabbath
Remember
O
my
concerning
this
and
spare
me
according
to
the
greatness
of
thy
Neh13:23
In
those
days
also
saw
I
Jews
that
had
married
wives
of
Ashdod,
of
and
of
Neh13:24
And
their
children
spake
half
in
the
speech
of
Ashdod,
and
could
not
speak
in
the
but
according
to
the
lan
guage
of
each
Neh13:25
And
I
contended
with
and
cursed
and
smote
certain
of
and
plucked
off
their
and
made
them
swear
by
Ye
shall
not
give
your
daughters
unto
their
nor
take
their
daughters
unto
your
or
for
Neh13:26
Did
not
Solomon
king
of
Israel
sin
by
these
yet
among
many
nations
was
there
no
king
like
who
was
beloved
of
his
and
God
made
him
king
over
all
nevertheless
even
him
did
outlandish
women
cause
to
Neh13:27
Shall
we
then
hearken
unto
you
to
do
all
this
great
to
transgress
against
our
God
in
marrying
strange
Neh13:28
And
one
of
the
sons
of
Joiada,
the
son
of
Eliashib
the
high
was
son
in
law
to
Sanballat
the
Horonite:
therefore
I
chased
him
from
Neh13:29
Remember
O
my
because
they
have
defiled
the
and
the
covenant
of
the
and
of
the
Levites.
Neh13:30
Thus
cleansed
I
them
from
all
and
appointed
the
wards
of
the
priests
and
the
Levites,
every
one
in
his
business

the
language
of
every
Est2:1
After
these
when
the
wrath
of
king
Ahasuerus
was
he
remembered
and
what
she
had
and
what
was
decreed
against
Est2:2
Then
said
the
king's
servants
that
ministered
unto
Let
there
be
fair
young
virgins
sought
for
the
Est2:3
And
let
the
king
appoint
officers
in
all
the
provinces
of
his
that
they
may
gather
together
all
the
fair
young
virg
ins
unto
Shushan
the
to
the
house
of
the
unto
the
custody
of
Hege
the
king's
keeper
of
the
and
l
et
their
things
for
purification
be
given
Est2:4
And
let
the
maiden
which
pleaseth
the
king
be
queen
instead
of
And
the
thing
pleased
the
and
he
did
Est2:5
Now
in
Shushan
the
palace
there
was
a
certain
whose
name
was
the
son
of
Jair,
the
son
of
Shimei,
the
son
of
K
ish,
a
Benjamite;
Est2:6
Who
had
been
carried
away
from
Jerusalem
with
the
captivity
which
had
been
carried
away
with
Jeconiah
king
of
whom
Ne
buchadnezzar
the
king
of
Babylon
had
carried
Est2:7
And
he
brought
up
Hadassah,
that
his
uncle's
for
she
had
neither
father
nor
and
the
maid
was
f
air
and
whom
when
her
father
and
mother
were
took
for
his
own
Est2:8
So
it
came
to
when
the
king's
commandment
and
his
decree
was
and
when
many
maidens
were
gathered
together
unto
Shushan
the
to
the
custody
of
Hegai,
that
Esther
was
brought
also
unto
the
king's
to
the
custody
of
Hegai,
keeper
of
the
Est2:9
And
the
maiden
pleased
and
she
obtained
kindness
of
and
he
speedily
gave
her
her
things
for
with
suc
h
things
as
belonged
to
and
seven
which
were
meet
to
be
given
out
of
the
king's
and
he
preferred
her
and
her
maids
unto
the
best
place
of
the
house
of
the
Est2:10
Esther
had
not
shewed
her
people
nor
her
for
Mordecai
had
charged
her
that
she
should
not
shew
Est2:11
And
Mordecai
walked
every
day
before
the
court
of
the
women's
to
know
how
Esther
and
what
should
become
of
Est2:12
Now
when
every
maid's
turn
was
come
to
go
in
to
king
after
that
she
had
been
twelve
according
to
the
man
ner
of
the
(for
so
were
the
days
of
their
purifications
to
six
months
with
oil
of
and
six
months
w
ith
sweet
and
with
other
things
for
the
purifying
of
the
women;)
Est2:13
Then
thus
came
every
maiden
unto
the
whatsoever
she
desired
was
given
her
to
go
with
her
out
of
the
house
of
the
wome
n
unto
the
king's
Est2:14
In
the
evening
she
and
on
the
morrow
she
returned
into
the
second
house
of
the
to
the
custody
of
Shaashgaz,
th
e
king's
which
kept
the
she
came
in
unto
the
king
no
except
the
king
delighted
in
and
that
she
were
called
by
Est2:15
Now
when
the
turn
of
the
daughter
of
Abihail
the
uncle
of
who
had
taken
her
for
his
was
come
to
go
in
unto
the
she
required
nothing
but
what
Hegai
the
king's
the
keeper
of
the
And
Esther
ob
tained
favour
in
the
sight
of
all
them
that
looked
upon
Est2:16
So
Esther
was
taken
unto
king
Ahasuerus
into
his
house
royal
in
the
tenth
which
is
the
month
Tebeth,
in
the
seventh
year
of
his
Est2:17
And
the
king
loved
Esther
above
all
the
and
she
obtained
grace
and
favour
in
his
sight
more
than
all
the
so
that
he
set
the
royal
crown
upon
her
and
made
her
queen
instead
of
Est2:18
Then
the
king
made
a
great
feast
unto
all
his
princes
and
his
even
Esther's
and
he
made
a
release
to
the
p
rovinces,
and
gave
according
to
the
state
of
the
Est2:19
And
when
the
virgins
were
gathered
together
the
second
then
Mordecai
sat
in
the
king's
Est2:20
Esther
had
not
yet
shewed
her
kindred
nor
her
as
Mordecai
had
charged
for
Esther
did
the
commandment
of
Mordec
like
as
when
she
was
brought
up
with
Est2:21
In
those
while
Mordecai
sat
in
the
king's
two
of
the
king's
Bigthan
and
Teresh,
of
those
which
ke
pt
the
were
and
sought
to
lay
hand
on
the
king
Est2:22
And
the
thing
was
known
to
who
told
it
unto
Esther
the
and
Esther
certified
the
king
thereof
in
Mordecai's
Est2:23
And
when
inquisition
was
made
of
the
it
was
found
therefore
they
were
both
hanged
on
a
and
it
was
writte
n
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
before
the
Est3:1
After
these
things
did
king
Ahasuerus
promote
Haman
the
son
of
Hammedatha
the
Agagite,
and
advanced
and
set
his
seat
ab
ove
all
the
princes
that
were
with
Est3:2
And
all
the
king's
that
were
in
the
king's
and
reverenced
Haman:
for
the
king
had
so
commanded
concer
ning
But
Mordecai
bowed
nor
did
him
Est3:3
Then
the
king's
which
were
in
the
king's
said
unto
Why
transgressest
thou
the
king's
Est3:4
Now
it
came
to
when
they
spake
daily
unto
and
he
hearkened
not
unto
that
they
told
Haman,
to
see
whether
Mo
rdecai's
matters
would
for
he
had
told
them
that
he
was
a
Est3:5
And
when
Haman
saw
that
Mordecai
bowed
nor
did
him
then
was
Haman
full
of
Est3:6
And
he
thought
scorn
to
lay
hands
on
Mordecai
for
they
had
shewed
him
the
people
of
wherefore
Haman
sought
to
destroy
all
the
Jews
that
were
throughout
the
whole
kingdom
of
even
the
people
of
Est3:7
In
the
first
that
the
month
Nisan,
in
the
twelfth
year
of
king
they
cast
Pur,
that
the
before
Haman
from
day
to
and
from
month
to
to
the
twelfth
that
the
month
Est3:8
And
Haman
said
unto
king
There
is
a
certain
people
scattered
abroad
and
dispersed
among
the
people
in
all
the
pro
vinces
of
thy
and
their
laws
are
diverse
from
all
neither
keep
they
the
king's
therefore
it
is
not
for
the
k
ing's
profit
to
suffer
Est3:9
If
it
please
the
let
it
be
written
that
they
may
be
and
I
will
pay
ten
thousand
talents
of
silver
to
the
ha
nds
of
those
that
have
the
charge
of
the
to
bring
it
into
the
king's
Est3:10
And
the
king
took
his
ring
from
his
and
gave
it
unto
Haman
the
son
of
Hammedatha
the
Agagite,
the
Est3:11
And
the
king
said
unto
Haman,
The
silver
is
given
to
the
people
to
do
with
them
as
it
seemeth
good
to
Est3:12
Then
were
the
king's
scribes
called
on
the
thirteenth
day
of
the
first
and
there
was
written
according
to
all
that
H
aman
had
commanded
unto
the
king's
and
to
the
governors
that
were
over
every
and
to
the
rulers
of
every
peop
le
of
every
province
according
to
the
writing
and
to
every
people
after
their
in
the
name
of
king
Ahasuerus
was
it
and
sealed
with
the
king's
Est3:13
And
the
letters
were
sent
by
posts
into
all
the
king's
to
to
and
to
cause
to
all
bo
th
young
and
little
children
and
in
one
even
upon
the
thirteenth
day
of
the
twelfth
which
is
the
month
Adar
,
and
to
take
the
spoil
of
them
for
a
Est3:14
The
copy
of
the
writing
for
a
commandment
to
be
given
in
every
province
was
published
unto
all
that
they
should
be
ready
against
that
Est3:15
The
posts
went
being
hastened
by
the
king's
and
the
decree
was
given
in
Shushan
the
And
the
king
and
Haman
sat
down
to
but
the
city
Shushan
was
Est4:1
When
Mordecai
perceived
all
that
was
Mordecai
rent
his
and
put
on
sackcloth
with
and
went
out
into
the
midst
of
the
and
cried
with
a
loud
and
a
bitter
Est4:2
And
came
even
before
the
king's
for
none
might
enter
into
the
king's
gate
clothed
with
Est4:3
And
in
every
whithersoever
the
king's
commandment
and
his
decree
there
was
great
mourning
among
the
an
d
and
and
and
many
lay
in
sackcloth
and
Est4:4
So
Esther's
maids
and
her
chamberlains
came
and
told
it
Then
was
the
queen
exceedingly
and
she
sent
raiment
to
clothe
and
to
take
away
his
sackcloth
from
but
he
received
it
Est4:5
Then
called
Esther
for
Hatach,
one
of
the
king's
whom
he
had
appointed
to
attend
upon
and
gave
him
a
comm
andment
to
to
know
what
it
and
why
it
Est4:6
So
Hatach
went
forth
to
Mordecai
unto
the
street
of
the
which
was
before
the
king's
Est4:7
And
Mordecai
told
him
of
all
that
had
happened
unto
and
of
the
sum
of
the
money
that
Haman
had
promised
to
pay
to
the
k
ing's
treasuries
for
the
to
destroy
Est4:8
Also
he
gave
him
the
copy
of
the
writing
of
the
decree
that
was
given
at
Shushan
to
destroy
to
shew
it
unto
an
d
to
declare
it
unto
and
to
charge
her
that
she
should
go
in
unto
the
to
make
supplication
unto
and
to
make
request
before
him
for
her
Est4:9
And
Hatach
came
and
told
Esther
the
words
of
Est4:10
Again
Esther
spake
unto
Hatach,
and
gave
him
commandment
unto
Est4:11
All
the
king's
and
the
people
of
the
king's
do
that
whether
man
or
shall
come
unto
the
king
into
the
inner
who
is
not
there
is
one
law
of
his
to
put
him
to
except
such
to
whom
the
king
sh
all
hold
out
the
golden
that
he
may
but
I
have
not
been
called
to
come
in
unto
the
king
these
thirty
Est4:12
And
they
told
to
Mordecai
Esther's
Est4:13
Then
Mordecai
commanded
to
answer
Think
not
with
thyself
that
thou
shalt
escape
in
the
king's
more
than
all
the
Est4:14
For
if
thou
altogether
holdest
thy
peace
at
this
then
shall
there
enlargement
and
deliverance
arise
to
the
Jews
from
another
but
thou
and
thy
father's
house
shall
be
and
who
knoweth
whether
thou
art
come
to
the
kingdom
for
such
a
time
as
Est4:15
Then
Esther
bade
them
return
Mordecai
this
Est4:16
gather
together
all
the
Jews
that
are
present
in
and
fast
ye
for
and
neither
eat
nor
drink
three
nig
ht
or
I
also
and
my
maidens
will
fast
and
so
will
I
go
in
unto
the
which
is
not
according
to
the
and
if
I
I
Est4:17
So
Mordecai
went
his
and
did
according
to
all
that
Esther
had
commanded
Est5:1
Now
it
came
to
pass
on
the
third
that
Esther
put
on
her
royal
and
stood
in
the
inner
court
of
the
king's
house
,
over
against
the
king's
and
the
king
sat
upon
his
royal
throne
in
the
royal
over
against
the
gate
of
the
Est5:2
And
it
was
when
the
king
saw
Esther
the
queen
standing
in
the
that
she
obtained
favour
in
his
and
the
king
held
out
to
Esther
the
golden
sceptre
that
was
in
his
So
Esther
drew
and
touched
the
top
of
the
Est5:3
Then
said
the
king
unto
What
wilt
queen
and
what
is
thy
it
shall
be
even
given
thee
to
the
half
of
the
Est5:4
And
Esther
If
it
seem
good
unto
the
let
the
king
and
Haman
come
this
day
unto
the
banquet
that
I
have
prepar
ed
for
Est5:5
Then
the
king
Cause
Haman
to
make
that
he
may
do
as
Esther
hath
So
the
king
and
Haman
came
to
the
banquet
that
Esther
had
Est5:6
And
the
king
said
unto
Esther
at
the
banquet
of
What
is
thy
and
it
shall
be
granted
and
what
is
thy
re
even
to
the
half
of
the
kingdom
it
shall
be
Est5:7
Then
answered
and
My
petition
and
my
request
Est5:8
If
I
have
found
favour
in
the
sight
of
the
and
if
it
please
the
king
to
grant
my
and
to
perform
my
let
the
king
and
Haman
come
to
the
banquet
that
I
shall
prepare
for
and
I
will
do
to
morrow
as
the
king
hath
Est5:9
Then
went
Haman
forth
that
day
joyful
and
with
a
glad
but
when
Haman
saw
Mordecai
in
the
king's
that
he
stood
n
ot
nor
moved
for
he
was
full
of
indignation
against
Est5:10
Nevertheless
Haman
refrained
and
when
he
came
he
sent
and
called
for
his
and
Zeresh
his
Est5:11
And
Haman
told
them
of
the
glory
of
his
and
the
multitude
of
his
and
all
the
things
wherein
the
king
had
promoted
and
how
he
had
advanced
him
above
the
princes
and
servants
of
the
Est5:12
Haman
said
Esther
the
queen
did
let
no
man
come
in
with
the
king
unto
the
banquet
that
she
had
prepared
but
and
to
morrow
am
I
invited
unto
her
also
with
the
Est5:13
Yet
all
this
availeth
me
so
long
as
I
see
Mordecai
the
Jew
sitting
at
the
king's
Est5:14
Then
said
Zeresh
his
wife
and
all
his
friends
unto
Let
a
gallows
be
made
of
fifty
cubits
and
to
morrow
speak
tho
u
unto
the
king
that
Mordecai
may
be
hanged
then
go
thou
in
merrily
with
the
king
unto
the
And
the
thing
pleased
Haman;
and
he
caused
the
gallows
to
be
Est6:1
On
that
night
could
not
the
king
and
he
commanded
to
bring
the
book
of
records
of
the
and
they
were
read
before
the
Est6:2
And
it
was
found
that
Mordecai
had
told
of
Bigthana
and
Teresh,
two
of
the
king's
the
keepers
of
the
who
sought
to
lay
hand
on
the
king
Est6:3
And
the
king
What
honour
and
dignity
hath
been
done
to
Mordecai
for
Then
said
the
king's
servants
that
ministere
d
unto
There
is
nothing
done
for
Est6:4
And
the
king
Who
is
in
the
Now
Haman
was
come
into
the
outward
court
of
the
king's
to
speak
unto
the
kin
g
to
hang
Mordecai
on
the
gallows
that
he
had
prepared
for
Est6:5
And
the
king's
servants
said
unto
Haman
standeth
in
the
And
the
king
Let
him
come
Est6:6
So
Haman
came
And
the
king
said
unto
What
shall
be
done
unto
the
man
whom
the
king
delighteth
to
Now
Haman
thought
in
his
To
whom
would
the
king
delight
to
do
honour
more
than
to
Est6:7
And
Haman
answered
the
For
the
man
whom
the
king
delighteth
to
Est6:8
Let
the
royal
apparel
be
brought
which
the
king
useth
to
and
the
horse
that
the
king
rideth
and
the
crown
royal
which
is
set
upon
his
Est6:9
And
let
this
apparel
and
horse
be
delivered
to
the
hand
of
one
of
the
king's
most
noble
that
they
may
array
the
man
withal
whom
the
king
delighteth
to
and
bring
him
on
horseback
through
the
street
of
the
and
proclaim
before
Thu
s
shall
it
be
done
to
the
man
whom
the
king
delighteth
to
Est6:10
Then
the
king
said
to
Haman,
Make
and
take
the
apparel
and
the
as
thou
hast
and
do
even
so
to
Mordecai
the
that
sitteth
at
the
king's
let
nothing
fail
of
all
that
thou
hast
Est6:11
Then
took
Haman
the
apparel
and
the
and
arrayed
and
brought
him
on
horseback
through
the
street
of
the
cit
y,
and
proclaimed
before
Thus
shall
it
be
done
unto
the
man
whom
the
king
delighteth
to
Est6:12
And
Mordecai
came
again
to
the
king's
But

Therefore
the

And
the
Jews
undertook
to
do
as
they
had
and
as
Mordecai
had
written
unto

Because
Haman
the
son
of

Wherefore
they
called
these
days
Purim
after
the
name
of

Therefore
for
all
the
words
of
this
and
of
that
which
they
had
seen
concerning
this

which
had
come
unto

of

Job1:22
In
all
this
Job

nor
charged

Job2:1
Again
there
was
a
day
when
the
sons
of
God
came
to
present
themselves
before

Satan
came
also
among
them

himself
before

And
the
LORD

Satan
answered

From

and
from

Job2:3
And
the
LORD
said
unto
Hast
thou
considered
my
servant
that
there
is
none

in
the

a

that
feareth

escheweth

still
he

thou

And
Satan
answered

And

So
went
Satan
forth

he

Then

In
all
this
did
not
Job
sin
with
his
Job2:11
Now
when
Job's
three
friends
heard
of
all
this
evil
that
was
come
upon
they
came
every
one
from
his
own
Eliphaz
the
Temanite,
and
Bildad
the
Shuhite,
and
Zophar
the
Naamathite:
for
they
had
made
an
appointment
together
to
come
to
mourn
with
h
im
and
to
comfort
Job2:12
And
when
they
lifted
up
their
eyes
afar
and
knew
him
they
lifted
up
their
and
and
they
rent
every
on
e
his
and
sprinkled
dust
upon
their
heads
toward
Job2:13
So
they
sat
down
with
him
upon
the
ground
seven
days
and
seven
and
none
spake
a
word
unto
for
they
saw
that
hi

grief
was

After
this
opened
Job
his
and
cursed
his
Job3:2
And
Job
and
Job3:3
Let
the
day
perish
wherein
I
was
and
the
night
in
which
it
was
There
is
a
man
child
Job3:4
Let
that
day
be
let
not
God
regard
it
from
neither
let
the
light
shine

Job3:5
Let
darkness
and
the
shadow
of
death
stain
let
a
cloud
dwell
upon
let
the
blackness
of
the
day
terrify
Job3:6
As
for
that

darkness

it
not
be
joined
unto
the
days
of

it
not

let
that
night

Let
them
curse

Let

of

thereof

Job3:10
Because
it
shut
not
up
the
doors
of
my
mother's
nor
hid
sorrow
from
mine
Job3:11
Why
died
I
not
from
the
why
did
I
not
give
up
the
ghost
when
I
came
out
of
the
Job3:12
Why
did
the
knees
prevent
or
why
the
breasts
that
I
should
Job3:13
For
now
should
I
have
lain
still
and
been
I
should
have
then
had
I
been
at
Job3:14
With
kings
and
counsellors
of
the
which
built
desolate
places
for
Job3:15
Or
with
princes
that
had
who
filled
their
houses
with
Job3:16
Or
as
an
hidden
untimely
birth
I
had
not
as
infants
which
never
saw
Job3:17
There
the
wicked
cease
from
and
there
the
weary
be
at
Job3:18
There
the
prisoners
rest
they
hear
not
the
voice
of
the
Job3:19
The
small
and
great
are
and
the
servant
is
free
from
his
Job3:20
Wherefore
is
light
given
to
him
that
is
in
and
life
unto
the
bitter
in
Job3:21
Which
long
for
but
it
cometh
and
dig
for
it
more
than
for
hid
Job3:22
Which
rejoice
and
are
when
they
can
find
the
Job3:23
Why
is
light
given
to
a
man
whose
way
is
and
whom
God
hath
hedged
Job3:24
For
my
sighing
cometh
before
I
and
my
roarings
are
poured
out
like
the
Job3:25
For
the
thing
which
I
greatly
feared
is
come
upon
and
that
which
I
was
afraid
of
is
come
unto
Job3:26
I
was
not
in
neither
had
I
neither
was
I
yet

Job4:1
Then
Eliphaz
the
Temanite
answered
and
Job4:2
If
we
assay
to
commune
with
wilt
thou
be
but
who
can
withhold
himself
from
Job4:3
thou
hast
instructed
and
thou
hast
strengthened
the
weak
Job4:4
Thy
words
have
upholden
him
that
was
and
thou
hast
strengthened
the
feeble
Job4:5
But
now
it
is
come
upon
and
thou
it
toucheth
and
thou
art
Job4:6
Is
not
this
thy
thy
thy
and
the
uprightness
of
thy
Job4:7
I
pray
who
ever
being
or
where
were
the
righteous
cut
Job4:8
Even
as
I
have
they
that
plow
and
sow
reap
the
Job4:9
By
the
blast
of
God
they
and
by
the
breath
of
his
nostrils
are
they
Job4:10
The
roaring
of
the
and
the
voice
of
the
fierce
and
the
teeth
of
the
young
are
Job4:11
The
old
lion
perisheth
for
lack
of
and
the
stout
lion's
whelps
are
scattered
Job4:12
Now
a
thing
was
secretly
brought
to
and
mine
ear
received
a
little
Job4:13
In
thoughts
from
the
visions
of
the
when
deep
sleep
falleth
on
Job4:14
Fear
came
upon
and
which
made
all
my
bones
to
Job4:15
Then
a
spirit
passed
before
my
the
hair
of
my
flesh
stood
Job4:16
It
stood
but
I
could
not
discern
the
form
an
image
was
before
mine
there
was
and
I
heard
a
v
oice,
Job4:17
Shall
mortal
man
be
more
just
than

a
man
be
more
pure
than

Job4:18
he
put
no
trust
in
his
and
his
angels
he
charged
with
Job4:19
How
much
less
in
them
that
dwell
in
houses
of
whose
foundation
is
in
the
which
are
crushed
before
the
Job4:20
They
are
destroyed
from
morning
to
they
perish
for
ever
without
any
regarding

Doth
not

without

Call

there
be
any

of
the
saints

For
wrath
killeth
the
foolish

envy
slayeth

silly

I
have
seen
the
foolish

suddenly
I
cursed

His
children
are
far
from

they
are
crushed
in

is
there
any

Whose
harvest
the
hungry

Although

not

Yet

born

I
would

would
I
commit
my

Which

great

marvellous

Who

To

They

But

In

Thou

At

Job8:18
If
he
destroy
him
from
his
then
it
shall
deny
I
have
not
seen
Job8:19
this
is
the
joy
of
his
and
out
of
the
earth
shall
others
Job8:20
God
will
not
cast
away
a
perfect
neither
will
he
help
the
evil
Job8:21
Till
he
fill
thy
mouth
with
and
thy
lips
with
Job8:22
They
that
hate
thee
shall
be
clothed
with
and
the
dwelling
place
of
the
wicked
shall
come
to
Job9:1
Then
Job
answered
and
Job9:2
I
know
it
is
so
of
a
but
how
should
man
be
just
with
Job9:3
If
he
will
contend
with
he
cannot
answer
him
one
of
a
Job9:4
He
is
wise
in
and
mighty
in
who
hath
hardened
himself
against
and
hath
Job9:5
Which
removeth
the
and
they
know
which
overturneth
them
in
his
Job9:6
Which
shaketh
the
earth
out
of
her
and
the
pillars
thereof
Job9:7
Which
commandeth
the
and
it
riseth
and
sealeth
up
the
Job9:8
Which
alone
spreadeth
out
the
and
treadeth
upon
the
waves
of
the
Job9:9
Which
maketh
and
and
the
chambers
of
the
Job9:10
Which
doeth
great
things
past
finding
and
wonders
without
Job9:11
he
goeth
by
and
I
see
him
he
passeth
on
but
I
perceive
him
Job9:12
he
taketh
who
can
hinder
who
will
say
unto
What
doest
Job9:13
If
God
will
not
withdraw
his
the
proud
helpers
do
stoop
under
Job9:14
How
much
less
shall
I
answer
and
choose
out
my
words
to
reason
with
Job9:15
though
I
were
yet
would
I
not
but
I
would
make
supplication
to
my
Job9:16
If
I
had
and
he
had
answered
yet
would
I
not
believe
that
he
had
hearkened
unto
my
Job9:17
For
he
breaketh
me
with
a
and
multiplieth
my
wounds
without
Job9:18
He
will
not
suffer
me
to
take
my
but
filleth
me
with
Job9:19
If
I
speak
of
he
is
and
if
of
who
shall
set
me
a
time
to
Job9:20
If
I
justify
mine
own
mouth
shall
condemn
if
I
I
am
it
shall
also
prove
me
Job9:21
Though
I
were
yet
would
I
not
know
my
I
would
despise
my
Job9:22
This
is
one
therefore
I
said
He
destroyeth
the
perfect
and
the
Job9:23
If
the
scourge
slay
he
will
laugh
at
the
trial
of
the
Job9:24
The
earth
is
given
into
the
hand
of
the
he
covereth
the
faces
of
the
judges
if
and
who
is
Job9:25
Now
my
days
are
swifter
than
a
they
flee
they
see
no
Job9:26
They
are
passed
away
as
the
swift
as
the
eagle
that
hasteth
to
the
Job9:27
If
I
I
will
forget
my
I
will
leave
off
my
and
comfort
Job9:28
I
am
afraid
of
all
my
I
know
that
thou
wilt
not
hold
me
Job9:29
If
I
be
why
then
labour
I
in
Job9:30
If
I
wash
myself
with
snow
and
make
my
hands
never
so
Job9:31
Yet
shalt
thou
plunge
me
in
the
and
mine
own
clothes
shall
abhor
Job9:32
For
he
is
not
a
as
I
that
I
should
answer
and
we
should
come
together
in
Job9:33
Neither
is
there
any
daysman
betwixt
that
might
lay
his
hand
upon
us
Job9:34
Let
him
take
his
rod
away
from
and
let
not
his
fear
terrify
Job9:35
Then
would
I
and
not
fear
but
it
is
not
so
with
Job10:1
My
soul
is
weary
of
my
I
will
leave
my
complaint
upon
I
will
speak
in
the
bitterness
of
my
Job10:2
I
will
say
unto
Do
not
condemn
shew
me
wherefore
thou
contendest
with
Job10:3
Is
it
good
unto
thee
that
thou
shouldest
that
thou
shouldest
despise
the
work
of
thine
and
shine
upon
the
c
ounsel
of
the
Job10:4
Hast
thou
eyes
of
or
seest
thou
as
man
seeth?
Job10:5
Are
thy
days
as
the
days
of
are
thy
years
as
man's
Job10:6
That
thou
enquirest
after
mine
and
searchest
after
my
Job10:7
Thou
knowest
that
I
am
not
and
there
is
none
that
can
deliver
out
of
thine
Job10:8
Thine
hands
have
made
me
and
fashioned
me
together
round
yet
thou
dost
destroy
Job10:9
I
beseech
that
thou
hast
made
me
as
the
and
wilt
thou
bring
me
into
dust
Job10:10
Hast
thou
not
poured
me
out
as
and
curdled
me
like
Job10:11
Thou
hast
clothed
me
with
skin
and
and
hast
fenced
me
with
bones
and
Job10:12
Thou
hast
granted
me
life
and
and
thy
visitation
hath
preserved
my
Job10:13
And
these
things
hast
thou
hid
in
thine
I
know
that
this
is
with
Job10:14
If
I
then
thou
markest
and
thou
wilt
not
acquit
me
from
mine
Job10:15
If
I
be
woe
unto
and
if
I
be
yet
will
I
not
lift
up
my
I
am
full
of
therefore
see
thou
mine
Job10:16
For
it
increaseth.
Thou
huntest
me
as
a
fierce
and
again
thou
shewest
thyself
marvellous
upon
Job10:17
Thou
renewest
thy
witnesses
against
and
increasest
thine
indignation
upon
changes
and
war
are
against
Job10:18
Wherefore
then
hast
thou
brought
me
forth
out
of
the
Oh
that
I
had
given
up
the
and
no
eye
had
seen
Job10:19
I
should
have
been
as
though
I
had
not
I
should
have
been
carried
from
the
womb
to
the
Job10:20
Are
not
my
days
cease
and
let
me
that
I
may
take
comfort
a
Job10:21
Before
I
go
whence
I
shall
not
even
to
the
land
of
darkness
and
the
shadow
of
Job10:22
A
land
of
as
darkness
and
of
the
shadow
of
without
any
and
where
the
light
is
as
Job11:1
Then
answered
Zophar
the
Naamathite,
and
Job11:2
Should
not
the
multitude
of
words
be
and
should
a
man
full
of
talk
be
Job11:3
Should
thy
lies
make
men
hold
their
and
when
thou
mockest,
shall
no
man
make
thee
Job11:4
For
thou
hast
My
doctrine
is
and
I
am
clean
in
thine
Job11:5
But
oh
that
God
would
and
open
his
lips
against
Job11:6
And
that
he
would
shew
thee
the
secrets
of
that
they
are
double
to
that
which
Know
therefore
that
God
exacteth
of
thee
less
than
thine
iniquity
deserveth.
Job11:7
Canst
thou
by
searching
find
out
canst
thou
find
out
the
Almighty
unto
Job11:8
It
is
as
high
as
what
canst
thou
deeper
than
what
canst
thou
Job11:9
The
measure
thereof
is
longer
than
the
and
broader
than
the
Job11:10
If
he
cut
and
shut
or
gather
then
who
can
hinder
Job11:11
For
he
knoweth
vain
he
seeth
wickedness
will
he
not
then
consider
Job11:12
For
vain
man
would
be
though
man
be
born
like
a
wild
ass's
Job11:13
If
thou
prepare
thine
and
stretch
out
thine
hands
toward
Job11:14
If
iniquity
be
in
thine
put
it
far
and
let
not
wickedness
dwell
in
thy
Job11:15
For
then
shalt
thou
lift
up
thy
face
without
thou
shalt
be
and
shalt
not
Job11:16
Because
thou
shalt
forget
thy
and
remember
it
as
waters
that
pass
Job11:17
And
thine
age
shall
be
clearer
than
the
thou
shalt
shine
thou
shalt
be
as
the
Job11:18
And
thou
shalt
be
because
there
is
thou
shalt
dig
about
and
thou
shalt
take
thy
rest
in
Job11:19
Also
thou
shalt
lie
and
none
shall
make
thee
many
shall
make
suit
unto
Job11:20
But
the
eyes
of
the
wicked
shall
and
they
shall
not
and
their
hope
shall
be
as
the
giving
up
of
the
Job12:1
And
Job
answered
and
Job12:2
No
doubt
but
ye
are
the
and
wisdom
shall
die
with
Job12:3
But
I
have
understanding
as
well
as
I
am
not
inferior
to
who
knoweth
not
such
things
as
Job12:4
I
am
as
one
mocked
of
his
who
calleth
upon
and
he
answereth
the
just
upright
man
is
laughed
to
Job12:5
He
that
is
ready
to
slip
with
his
feet
is
as
a
lamp
despised
in
the
thought
of
him
that
is
at
Job12:6
The
tabernacles
of
robbers
and
they
that
provoke
God
are
into
whose
hand
God
bringeth
Job12:7
But
ask
now
the
and
they
shall
teach
and
the
fowls
of
the
and
they
shall
tell
Job12:8
Or
speak
to
the
and
it
shall
teach
and
the
fishes
of
the
sea
shall
declare
unto
Job12:9
Who
knoweth
not
in
all
these
that
the
hand
of
the
LORD
hath
wrought
Job12:10
In
whose
hand
is
the
soul
of
every
living
and
the
breath
of
all
Job12:11
Doth
not
the
ear
try

mouth
taste
his
Job12:12
With
the
ancient
is
and
in
length
of
days
Job12:13
With
him
is
wisdom
and
he
hath
counsel
and
Job12:14
he
breaketh
and
it
cannot
be
built
he
shutteth
up
a
and
there
can
be
no
Job12:15
he
withholdeth
the
and
they
dry
also
he
sendeth
them
and
they
overturn
the
Job12:16
With
him
is
strength
and
the
deceived
and
the
deceiver
are
Job12:17
He
leadeth
counsellors
away
and
maketh
the
judges
Job12:18
He
looseth
the
bond
of
and
girdeth
their
loins
with
a
Job12:19
He
leadeth
princes
away
and
overthroweth
the
Job12:20
He
removeth
away
the
speech
of
the
and
taketh
away
the
understanding
of
the
Job12:21
He
poureth
contempt
upon
and
weakeneth
the
strength
of
the
Job12:22
He
discovereth
deep
things
out
of
and
bringeth
out
to
light
the
shadow
of
Job12:23
He
increaseth
the
and
destroyeth
he
enlargeth
the
and
straiteneth
them
Job12:24
He
taketh
away
the
heart
of
the
chief
of
the
people
of
the
and
causeth
them
to
wander
in
a
wilderness
where
there

no

They
grope
in
the
dark
without
and
he
maketh
them
to
stagger
like
a
drunken
Job13:1
mine
eye
hath
seen
all
mine
ear
hath
heard
and
understood
Job13:2
What
ye
the
same
do
I
know
I
am
not
inferior
unto
Job13:3
Surely
I
would
speak
to
the
and
I
desire
to
reason
with
Job13:4
But
ye
are
forgers
of
ye
are
all
physicians
of
no
Job13:5
O
that
ye
would
altogether
hold
your
and
it
should
be
your
Job13:6
Hear
now
my
and
hearken
to
the
pleadings
of
my
Job13:7
Will
ye
speak
wickedly
for
and
talk
deceitfully
for
Job13:8
Will
ye
accept
his
will
ye
contend
for
Job13:9
Is
it
good
that
he
should
search
you
or
as
one
man
mocketh
do
ye
so
mock
Job13:10
He
will
surely
reprove
if
ye
do
secretly
accept
Job13:11
Shall
not
his
excellency
make
you
and
his
dread
fall
upon
Job13:12
Your
remembrances
are
like
unto
your
bodies
to
bodies
of
Job13:13
Hold
your
let
me
that
I
may
and
let
come
on
me
what
Job13:14
Wherefore
do
I
take
my
flesh
in
my
and
put
my
life
in
mine
Job13:15
Though
he
slay
yet
will
I
trust
in
but
I
will
maintain
mine
own
ways
before
Job13:16
He
also
shall
be
my
for
an
hypocrite
shall
not
come
before
Job13:17
Hear
diligently
my
and
my
declaration
with
your
Job13:18
Behold
I
have
ordered
my
I
know
that
I
shall
be
Job13:19
Who
is
he
that
will
plead
with
for
if
I
hold
my
I
shall
give
up
the
Job13:20
Only
do
not
two
things
unto
then
will
I
not
hide
myself
from
Job13:21
Withdraw
thine
hand
far
from
and
let
not
thy
dread
make
me
Job13:22
Then
call
and
I
will
or
let
me
and
answer
thou
Job13:23
How
many
are
mine
iniquities
and
make
me
to
know
my
transgression
and
my
Job13:24
Wherefore
hidest
thou
thy
and
holdest
me
for
thine
Job13:25
Wilt
thou
break
a
leaf
driven
to
and
and
wilt
thou
pursue
the
dry
Job13:26
For
thou
writest
bitter
things
against
and
makest
me
to
possess
the
iniquities
of
my
Job13:27
Thou
puttest
my
feet
also
in
the
and
lookest
narrowly
unto
all
my
thou
settest
a
print
upon
the
heels
of
my
Job13:28
And
as
a
rotten
consumeth,
as
a
garment
that
is
moth
Job14:1
Man
that
is
born
of
a
woman
is
of
few
and
full
of
Job14:2
He
cometh
forth
like
a
and
is
cut
he
fleeth
also
as
a
and
continueth
Job14:3
And
dost
thou
open
thine
eyes
upon
such
an
and
bringest
me
into
judgment
with
Job14:4
Who
can
bring
a
clean
thing
out
of
an
not
Job14:5
Seeing
his
days
are
the
number
of
his
months
are
with

hast
appointed
his
bounds
that
he
cannot
Job14:6
Turn
from
that
he
may
till
he
shall

an

Job14:7
For
there
is
hope
of
a

it
be
cut
that
it
will
sprout

that
the
tender
branch
thereof
will
not

Job14:8
Though
the
root
thereof
wax
old
in
the
and
the
stock
thereof
die
in
the
Job14:9
Yet
through
the
scent
of
water
it
will
and
bring
forth
boughs
like
a
Job14:10
But
man
dieth,
and
wasteth
man
giveth
up

As
the
waters
fail
from
the

flood
decayeth

drieth
Job14:12
So
man
lieth

riseth

O
that
thou
wouldest
hide
me
in
the
that
thou
wouldest
keep
me
until
thy
wrath
be

thou
wouldest
appoint
me
a
set

remember
Job14:14
If
a
man
shall
he
live
all
the
days
of
my
appointed
time
will
I
till
my
change
Job14:15
Thou
shalt
and
I
will
answer
thou
wilt
have
a
desire
to
the
work
of
thine
Job14:16
For
now
thou
numberest
my
dost
thou
not
watch
over
my
Job14:17
My
transgression
is
sealed
up
in
a
and
thou
sewest
up
mine
Job14:18
And
surely
the
mountain
falling
cometh
to

the
rock
is
removed
out
of

Job14:19
The
waters
wear
the
thou
washest
away
the
things
which
grow
out
of
the
dust
of
the
and
thou
destroyest
the
hope
of
Job14:20
Thou
prevailest
for
ever
against

he
passeth:
thou
changest
his
and
sendest
him
Job14:21
His
sons
come
to
and
he
knoweth
it
and
they
are
brought
but
he
perceiveth
it
not
of
Job14:22
But
his
flesh
upon
him
shall
have

his
soul
within
him
shall
Job15:1
Then
answered
Eliphaz
the
Temanite,
and
Job15:2
Should
a
wise
man
utter
vain
and
fill
his
belly
with
the
east
Job15:3
Should
he
reason
with
unprofitable
or
with
speeches
wherewith
he
can
do
no
Job15:4
thou
castest
off
and
restrainest
prayer
before
Job15:5
For
thy
mouth
uttereth
thine
and
thou
choosest
the
tongue
of
the
Job15:6
Thine
own
mouth
condemneth
and
not
thine
own
lips
testify
against
Job15:7
Art
thou
the
first
man
that
was
or
wast
thou
made
before
the
Job15:8
Hast
thou
heard
the
secret
of
and
dost
thou
restrain
wisdom
to
Job15:9
What
knowest
that
we
know
what
understandest
which
is
not
in
Job15:10
With
us
are
both
the
grayheaded
and
very
aged
much
elder
than
thy
Job15:11
Are
the
consolations
of
God
small
with
is
there
any
secret
thing
with
Job15:12
Why
doth
thine
heart
carry
thee
and
what
do
thy
eyes
wink
Job15:13
That
thou
turnest
thy
spirit
against
and
lettest
such
words
go
out
of
thy
Job15:14
What
is
that
he
should
be
and
he
which
is
born
of
a
that
he
should
be
Job15:15
he
putteth
no
trust
in
his
the
heavens
are
not
clean
in
his
Job15:16
How
much
more
abominable
and
filthy
is
which
drinketh
iniquity
like
Job15:17
I
will
shew
hear
and
that
which
I
have
seen
I
will
Job15:18
Which
wise
men
have
told
from
their
and
have
not
hid
Job15:19
Unto
whom
alone
the
earth
was
and
no
stranger
passed
among
Job15:20
The
wicked
man
travaileth
with
pain
all
his
and
the
number
of
years
is
hidden
to
the
Job15:21
A
dreadful
sound
is
in
his
in
prosperity
the
destroyer
shall
come
upon
Job15:22
He
believeth
not
that
he
shall
return
out
of
and
he
is
waited
for
of
the
Job15:23
He
wandereth
abroad
for
Where
is
he
knoweth
that
the
day
of
darkness
is
ready
at
his
Job15:24
Trouble
and
anguish
shall
make
him
they
shall
prevail
against
as
a
king
ready
to
the
Job15:25
For
he
stretcheth
out
his
hand
against
and
strengtheneth
himself
against
the
Job15:26
He
runneth
upon
even
on
his
upon
the
thick
bosses
of
his
bucklers:
Job15:27
Because
he
covereth
his
face
with
his
and
maketh
collops
of
fat
on
his
Job15:28
And
he
dwelleth
in
desolate
and
in
houses
which
no
man
inhabiteth,
which
are
ready
to
become
Job15:29
He
shall
not
be
neither
shall
his
substance
neither
shall
he
prolong
the
perfection
thereof
upon
the
earth
.
Job15:30
He
shall
not
depart
out
of
the
flame
shall
dry
up
his
and
by
the
breath
of
his
mouth
shall
he
go
Job15:31
Let
not
him
that
is
deceived
trust
in
for
vanity
shall
be
his
Job15:32
It
shall
be
accomplished
before
his
and
his
branch
shall
not
be
Job15:33
He
shall
shake
off
his
unripe
grape
as
the
and
shall
cast
off
his
flower
as
the
Job15:34
For
the
congregation
of
hypocrites
shall
be
and
fire
shall
consume
the
tabernacles
of
Job15:35
They
conceive
and
bring
forth
and
their
belly
prepareth
Job16:1
Then
Job
answered
and
Job16:2
I
have
heard
many
such
miserable
comforters
are
ye
Job16:3
Shall
vain
words
have
an
or
what
emboldeneth
thee
that
thou
answerest?
Job16:4
I
also
could
speak
as
ye
if
your
soul
were
in
my
soul's
I
could
heap
up
words
against
and
shake
mine
head
a
t
Job16:5
But
I
would
strengthen
you
with
my
and
the
moving
of
my
lips
should
asswage
your
Job16:6
Though
I
my
grief
is
not
asswaged:
and
though
I
what
am
I
Job16:7
But
now
he
hath
made
me
thou
hast
made
desolate
all
my
Job16:8
And
thou
hast
filled
me
with
which
is
a
witness
against
and
my
leanness
rising
up
in
me
beareth
witness
to
my
Job16:9
He
teareth
me
in
his
who
hateth
he
gnasheth
upon
me
with
his
mine
enemy
sharpeneth
his
eyes
upon
Job16:10
They
have
gaped
upon
me
with
their
they
have
smitten
me
upon
the
cheek
they
have
gathered
themselves
together
against
Job16:11
God
hath
delivered
me
to
the
and
turned
me
over
into
the
hands
of
the
Job16:12
I
was
at
but
he
hath
broken
me
he
hath
also
taken
me
by
my
and
shaken
me
to
and
set
me
up
for
his
Job16:13
His
archers
compass
me
round
he
cleaveth
my
reins
and
doth
not
he
poureth
out
my
gall
upon
the
grou
Job16:14
He
breaketh
me
with
breach
upon
he
runneth
upon
me
like
a
Job16:15
I
have
sewed
sackcloth
upon
my
and
defiled
my
horn
in
the
Job16:16
My
face
is
foul
with
and
on
my
eyelids
is
the
shadow
of
Job16:17
Not
for
any
injustice
in
mine
also
my
prayer
is
Job16:18
O
cover
not
thou
my
and
let
my
cry
have
no
Job16:19
Also
my
witness
is
in
and
my
record
is
on
Job16:20
My
friends
scorn
but
mine
eye
poureth
out
tears
unto
Job16:21
O
that
one
might
plead
for
a
man
with
as
a
man
pleadeth
for
his
Job16:22
When
a
few
years
are
then
I
shall
go
the
way
whence
I
shall
not
Job17:1
My
breath
is
my
days
are
the
graves
are
ready
for
Job17:2
Are
there
not
mockers
with
and
doth
not
mine
eye
continue
in
their
Job17:3
Lay
down
put
me
in
a
surety
with
who
is
he
that
will
strike
hands
with
Job17:4
For
thou
hast
hid
their
heart
from
therefore
shalt
thou
not
exalt
Job17:5
He
that
speaketh
flattery
to
his
even
the
eyes
of
his
children
shall
Job17:6
He
hath
made
me
also
a
byword
of
the
and
aforetime
I
was
as
a
tabret.
Job17:7
Mine
eye
also
is
dim
by
reason
of
and
all
my
members
are
as
a
Job17:8
Upright
men
shall
be
astonied
at
and
the
innocent
shall
stir
up
himself
against
the
Job17:9
The
righteous
also
shall
hold
on
his
and
he
that
hath
clean
hands
shall
be
stronger
and
Job17:10
But
as
for
you
do
ye
and
come
for
I
cannot
find
one
wise
man
among
Job17:11
My
days
are
my
purposes
are
broken
even
the
thoughts
of
my
Job17:12
They
change
the
night
into
the
light
is
short
because
of
Job17:13
If
I
the
grave
is
mine
I
have
made
my
bed
in
the
Job17:14
I
have
said
to
Thou
art
my
to
the
Thou
art
my
and
my
Job17:15
And
where
is
now
my
as
for
my
who
shall
see
Job17:16
They
shall
go
down
to
the
bars
of
the
when
our
rest
together
is
in
the
Job18:1
Then
answered
Bildad
the
Shuhite,
and
Job18:2
How
long
will
it
be
ere
ye
make
an
end
of
and
afterwards
we
will
Job18:3
Wherefore
are
we
counted
as
and
reputed
vile
in
your
Job18:4
He
teareth
himself
in
his
shall
the
earth
be
forsaken
for
and
shall
the
rock
be
removed
out
of
his
Job18:5
the
light
of
the
wicked
shall
be
put
and
the
spark
of
his
fire
shall
not
Job18:6
The
light
shall
be
dark
in
his
and
his
candle
shall
be
put
out
with
Job18:7
The
steps
of
his
strength
shall
be
and
his
own
counsel
shall
cast
him
Job18:8
For
he
is
cast
into
a
net
by
his
own
and
he
walketh
upon
a
Job18:9
The
gin
shall
take
him
by
the
and
the
robber
shall
prevail
against
Job18:10
The
snare
is
laid
for
him
in
the
and
a
trap
for
him
in
the
Job18:11
Terrors
shall
make
him
afraid
on
every
and
shall
drive
him
to
his
Job18:12
His
strength
shall
be
hungerbitten,
and
destruction
shall
be
ready
at
his
Job18:13
It
shall
devour
the
strength
of
his
even
the
firstborn
of
death
shall
devour
his
Job18:14
His
confidence
shall
be
rooted
out
of
his
and
it
shall
bring
him
to
the
king
of
Job18:15
It
shall
dwell
in
his
because
it
is
none
of
brimstone
shall
be
scattered
upon
his
Job18:16
His
roots
shall
be
dried
up
and
above
shall
his
branch
be
cut
Job18:17
His
remembrance
shall
perish
from
the
and
he
shall
have
no
name
in
the
Job18:18
He
shall
be
driven
from
light
into
and
chased
out
of
the
Job18:19
He
shall
neither
have
son
nor
nephew
among
his
nor
any
remaining
in
his
Job18:20
They
that
come
after
him
shall
be
astonied
at
his
as
they
that
went
before
were
affrighted.
Job18:21
Surely
such
are
the
dwellings
of
the
and
this
is
the
place
of
him
that
knoweth
not
Job19:1
Then
Job
answered
and
Job19:2
How
long
will
ye
vex
my
and
break
me
in
pieces
with
Job19:3
These
ten
times
have
ye
reproached
ye
are
not
ashamed
that
ye
make
yourselves
strange
to
Job19:4
And
be
it
indeed
that
I
have
mine
error
remaineth
with
Job19:5
If
indeed
ye
will
magnify
yourselves
against
and
plead
against
me
my
Job19:6
Know
now
that
God
hath
overthrown
and
hath
compassed
me
with
his
Job19:7
I
cry
out
of
but
I
am
not
I
cry
but
there
is
no
Job19:8
He
hath
fenced
up
my
way
that
I
cannot
and
he
hath
set
darkness
in
my
Job19:9
He
hath
stripped
me
of
my
and
taken
the
crown
from
my
Job19:10
He
hath
destroyed
me
on
every
and
I
am
and
mine
hope
hath
he
removed
like
a
Job19:11
He
hath
also
kindled
his
wrath
against
and
he
counteth
me
unto
him
as
one
of
his
Job19:12
His
troops
come
and
raise
up
their
way
against
and
encamp
round
about
my
Job19:13
He
hath
put
my
brethren
far
from
and
mine
acquaintance
are
verily
estranged
from
Job19:14
My
kinsfolk
have
and
my
familiar
friends
have
forgotten
Job19:15
They
that
dwell
in
mine
and
my
count
me
for
a
I
am
an
alien
in
their
Job19:16
I
called
my
and
he
gave
me
no
I
intreated
him
with
my
Job19:17
My
breath
is
strange
to
my
though
I
intreated
for
the
children's
sake
of
mine
own
Job19:18
young
children
despised
I
and
they
spake
against
Job19:19
All
my
inward
friends
abhorred
and
they
whom
I
loved
are
turned
against
Job19:20
My
bone
cleaveth
to
my
skin
and
to
my
and
I
am
escaped
with
the
skin
of
my

Have
pity
upon

pity
upon
O
ye
my
for
the
hand
of
God
hath
touched
Job19:22
Why
do
ye
persecute
me
as
and
are
not
satisfied
with
my
Job19:23
Oh
that
my
words
were
now
oh
that
they
were
printed
in
a
Job19:24
That
they
were
graven
with
an
iron
pen
and
lead
in
the
rock
for
Job19:25
For
I
know
that
my
redeemer
and
that
he
shall
stand
at
the
latter
day
upon
the
Job19:26
And
though
after
my
skin
worms
destroy
this
yet
in
my
flesh
shall
I
see
Job19:27
Whom
I
shall
see
for
and
mine
eyes
shall
and
not
though
my
reins
be
consumed
within
Job19:28
But
ye
should
Why
persecute
we
seeing
the
root
of
the
matter
is
found
in
Job19:29
Be
ye
afraid
of
the
for
wrath
bringeth
the
punishments
of
the
that
ye
may
know
there
is
a

Then
answered
Zophar
the
Naamathite,
and
Job20:2
Therefore
do
my
thoughts
cause
me
to
and
for
this
I
make

I
have
heard
the
check
of
my
and

spirit
of
my
understanding

Knowest
thou
not
this
of
since
man
was
placed
upon
Job20:5
That
the
triumphing
of
the
wicked
is
and
the
joy
of
the
hypocrite
but
for
a

Though
his
excellency

up
to
the
and
his
head
reach
unto

Yet
he
shall
perish
for
ever
like
his
own
they
which
have
seen
him
shall
Where
is
Job20:8
He
shall
fly
away
as
a
and
shall
not
be

shall
be
chased
away
as
a
vision
of

The
eye
also
which
saw
him
shall
see
him
no
neither
shall
his
place
any
more
behold

His
children
shall
seek
to
please

restore

His
bones
are
full
of
the
sin
of
his
which
shall
lie
down
with
him
in

Though
wickedness
be
sweet
in
his
though
he
hide
it
under
his
Job20:13
Though
he
spare
and
forsake
it
but
keep
it
still
within
his
Job20:14
Yet
his
meat
in
his
bowels
is
it
is
the
gall
of
asps
within
Job20:15
He
hath
swallowed
down
and
he
shall
vomit
them
up
God
shall
cast
them
out
of

He
shall
suck
the
poison
of
asps:
the
viper's
tongue
shall
slay
Job20:17
He
shall
not
see
the
the
the
brooks
of
honey
and

which
he
laboured
for

he
and
shall
not
swallow
it
according
to
his
substance
shall
the
restituti

he
shall
not
rejoice
Job20:19
Because
he
hath
oppressed
and
hath
forsaken
the
because
he
hath
violently
taken
away
an
house
which
he
builded
Job20:20
Surely
he
shall
not
feel
quietness
in
his
he
shall
not
save
of
that
which
he
Job20:21
There
shall
none
of

meat
be
therefore

no
man
look

In
the
fulness
of
his
sufficiency
he
shall
be
in

hand
of

wicked
shall
come
upon

When

about
to
fill

shall
cast

fury
of

wrath
upon

rain
it
upon

He

glittering
sword

terrors

All
darkness
shall
be
hid

secret

fire
not
blown

consume
it

go
ill
with

The

rise
up
against

The
increase
of

house
shall
and
his
goods
shall
flow
away
in

day
of

This
is
the
portion
of
a
wicked
man
from

the
heritage
appointed
unto
him
by
Job21:1
But
Job
answered
and
Job21:2
Hear
diligently
my
and
let
this
be
your

Suffer
me
that
I
may

after
that
I
have
mock

As
for

my
complaint
to

if
it

should
not

spirit
be

Mark

hand
upon

at

sound
of

They
spend
their
days
in

Therefore
they
say
unto
Depart

chaff

carrieth
Job21:19
God
layeth
up
his
iniquity
for
his
he
rewardeth
and
he
shall
know
Job21:20
His
eyes
shall
see
his
and
he
shall
drink
of
the
wrath
of
the
Job21:21
For
what
pleasure
hath
he
in
his
house
after
when
the
number
of
his
months
is
cut
off
in
the
Job21:22
Shall
any
teach
God
seeing
he
judgeth
those
that
are
Job21:23
One
dieth
in
his
full
being
wholly
at
ease
and
Job21:24
His
breasts
are
full
of
and
his
bones
are
moistened
with
Job21:25
And
another
dieth
in
the
bitterness
of
his
and
never
eateth
with
Job21:26
They
shall
lie
down
alike
in
the
and
the
worms
shall
cover
Job21:27
I
know
your
and
the
devices
which
ye
wrongfully
imagine
against
Job21:28
For
ye
Where
is
the
house
of
the
and
where
are
the
dwelling
places
of
the
Job21:29
Have
ye
not
asked
them
that
go
by
the
and
do
ye
not
know
their
Job21:30
That
the
wicked
is
reserved
to
the
day
of
they
shall
be
brought
forth
to
the
day
of
Job21:31
Who
shall
declare
his
way
to
his
and
who
shall
repay
him
what
he
hath
Job21:32
Yet
shall
he
be
brought
to
the
and
shall
remain
in
the
Job21:33
The
clods
of
the
valley
shall
be
sweet
unto
and
every
man
shall
draw
after
as
there
are
innumerable
before
Job21:34
How
then
comfort
ye
me
in
seeing
in
your
answers
there
remaineth
Job22:1
Then
Eliphaz
the
Temanite
answered
and
Job22:2
Can
a
man
be
profitable
unto
as
he
that
is
wise
may
be
profitable
unto
Job22:3
Is
it
any
pleasure
to
the
that
thou
art
or
is
it
gain
to
that
thou
makest
thy
ways
Job22:4
Will
he
reprove
thee
for
fear
of
will
he
enter
with
thee
into
Job22:5
Is
not
thy
wickedness
and
thine
iniquities
Job22:6
For
thou
hast
taken
a
pledge
from
thy
brother
for
and
stripped
the
naked
of
their
Job22:7
Thou
hast
not
given
water
to
the
weary
to
and
thou
hast
withholden
bread
from
the
Job22:8
But
as
for
the
mighty
he
had
the
and
the
honourable
man
dwelt
in
Job22:9
Thou
hast
sent
widows
away
and
the
arms
of
the
fatherless
have
been
Job22:10
Therefore
snares
are
round
about
and
sudden
fear
troubleth
Job22:11
Or
that
thou
canst
not
and
abundance
of
waters
cover
Job22:12
Is
not
God
in
the
height
of
and
behold
the
height
of
the
how
high
they
Job22:13
And
thou
sayest,
How
doth
God
can
he
judge
through
the
dark
Job22:14
Thick
clouds
are
a
covering
to
that
he
seeth
and
he
walketh
in
the
circuit
of
Job22:15
Hast
thou
marked
the
old
way
which
wicked
men
have
Job22:16
Which
were
cut
down
out
of
whose
foundation
was
overflown
with
a
Job22:17
Which
said
unto
Depart
from
and
what
can
the
Almighty
do
for
Job22:18
Yet
he
filled
their
houses
with
good
but
the
counsel
of
the
wicked
is
far
from
Job22:19
The
righteous
see
and
are
and
the
innocent
laugh
them
to
Job22:20
Whereas
our
substance
is
not
cut
but
the
remnant
of
them
the
fire
consumeth.
Job22:21
Acquaint
now
thyself
with
and
be
at
thereby
good
shall
come
unto
Job22:22
I
pray
the
law
from
his
and
lay
up
his
words
in
thine
Job22:23
If
thou
return
to
the
thou
shalt
be
built
thou
shalt
put
away
iniquity
far
from
thy
Job22:24
Then
shalt
thou
lay
up
gold
as
and
the
gold
of
Ophir
as
the
stones
of
the
Job22:25
the
Almighty
shall
be
thy
and
thou
shalt
have
plenty
of
Job22:26
For
then
shalt
thou
have
thy
delight
in
the
and
shalt
lift
up
thy
face
unto
Job22:27
Thou
shalt
make
thy
prayer
unto
and
he
shall
hear
and
thou
shalt
pay
thy
Job22:28
Thou
shalt
also
decree
a
and
it
shall
be
established
unto
and
the
light
shall
shine
upon
thy
Job22:29
When
men
are
cast
then
thou
shalt
There
is
lifting
and
he
shall
save
the
humble
Job22:30
He
shall
deliver
the
island
of
the
and
it
is
delivered
by
the
pureness
of
thine
Job23:1
Then
Job
answered
and
Job23:2
Even
to
day
is
my
complaint
my
stroke
is
heavier
than
my
Job23:3
Oh
that
I
knew
where
I
might
find
that
I
might
come
even
to
his
Job23:4
I
would
order
my
cause
before
and
fill
my
mouth
with
Job23:5
I
would
know
the
words
which
he
would
answer
and
understand
what
he
would
say
unto
Job23:6
Will
he
plead
against
me
with
his
great
but
he
would
put
strength
in
Job23:7
There
the
righteous
might
dispute
with
so
should
I
be
delivered
for
ever
from
my
Job23:8
I
go
but
he
is
not
and
but
I
cannot
perceive
Job23:9
On
the
left
where
he
doth
but
I
cannot
behold
he
hideth
himself
on
the
right
that
I
cannot
see
Job23:10
But
he
knoweth
the
way
that
I
when
he
hath
tried
I
shall
come
forth
as
Job23:11
My
foot
hath
held
his
his
way
have
I
and
not
Job23:12
Neither
have
I
gone
back
from
the
commandment
of
his
I
have
esteemed
the
words
of
his
mouth
more
than
my
necessary
f
ood.
Job23:13
But
he
is
in
one
and
who
can
turn
and
what
his
soul
desireth,
even
that
he
doeth.
Job23:14
For
he
performeth
the
thing
that
is
appointed
for
and
many
such
things
are
with
Job23:15
Therefore
am
I
troubled
at
his
when
I
I
am
afraid
of
Job23:16
For
God
maketh
my
heart
and
the
Almighty
troubleth
Job23:17
Because
I
was
not
cut
off
before
the
neither
hath
he
covered
the
darkness
from
my
Job24:1
seeing
times
are
not
hidden
from
the
do
they
that
know
him
not
see
his
Job24:2
Some
remove
the
they
violently
take
away
and
feed
Job24:3
They
drive
away
the
ass
of
the
they
take
the
widow's
ox
for
a
Job24:4
They
turn
the
needy
out
of
the
the
poor
of
the
earth
hide
themselves
Job24:5
as
wild
asses
in
the
go
they
forth
to
their
rising
betimes
for
a
the
wilderness
yieldeth
food
f
or
them
and
for
their
Job24:6
They
reap
every
one
his
corn
in
the
and
they
gather
the
vintage
of
the
Job24:7
They
cause
the
naked
to
lodge
without
that
they
have
no
covering
in
the
Job24:8
They
are
wet
with
the
showers
of
the
and
embrace
the
rock
for
want
of
a
Job24:9
They
pluck
the
fatherless
from
the
and
take
a
pledge
of
the
Job24:10
They
cause
him
to
go
naked
without
and
they
take
away
the
sheaf
from
the
Job24:11
Which
make
oil
within
their
and
tread
their
winepresses,
and
suffer
Job24:12
Men
groan
from
out
of
the
and
the
soul
of
the
wounded
crieth
yet
God
layeth
not
folly
to
Job24:13
They
are
of
those
that
rebel
against
the
they
know
not
the
ways
nor
abide
in
the
paths
Job24:14
The
murderer
rising
with
the
light
killeth
the
poor
and
and
in
the
night
is
as
a
Job24:15
The
eye
also
of
the
adulterer
waiteth
for
the
No
eye

see

disguiseth
his
Job24:16
In
the
dark
they
dig
through
which
they
had
marked
for
themselves
in
the
they
know
not
the
Job24:17
For
the
morning
is
to
them
even
as
the
shadow
of

one
know
they
are
in
the
terrors
of
the
shadow
of
Job24:18
He
is
swift
as

is
cursed
in

beholdeth

Drought

The

He
evil
entreateth

barren

beareth

doeth
not
good
to

Job24:22
He
draweth
also
the
mighty

riseth
and
no
man
is
sure
of
Job24:23
Though
it
be
given
him
to
be
in
whereon
he
resteth;
yet
his
eyes
are
upon
their
Job24:24
They
are
exalted
for
a
little
but
are
gone
and
brought
they
are
taken
out
of
the
way
as
all
and
cut
off
as
the
tops
of
the
ears
of
Job24:25
And
if
it
be
not
so
who
will
make
me
a

make

speech

Job25:1
Then
answered
Bildad
the
Shuhite,

Job25:2
Dominion
and
fear
are

peace
in
his
high
Job25:3
Is
there
any
number
of
his
and
upon

doth
not

light
Job25:4
How
then
can
man
be
justified
with
or
how
can
he
be
clean
that
is
born
of
a
Job25:5
Behold
even
to
the
and
it
shineth
the
stars
are
not
pure
in
his
Job25:6
How
much
less
that
is
a
and
the
son
of
which
is
a
Job26:1
But
Job
answered
and
Job26:2
How
hast
thou
helped
him
that
is
without
how
savest
thou
the
arm
that
hath
no
Job26:3
How
hast
thou
counselled
him
that
hath
no
and
how
hast
thou
plentifully
declared
the
thing
as
it
Job26:4
To
whom
hast
thou
uttered
and
whose
spirit
came
from
Job26:5
Dead
things

formed
from

Hell

naked

destruction

He
stretcheth
out
the
north
over
the
empty

hangeth
the
earth
upon

He
bindeth
up
the
waters
in
his
thick
and
the
cloud
is
not
rent
under
Job26:9
He
holdeth
back
the
face
of

and
spreadeth
his
cloud
upon

He
hath
compassed
the
waters
with

night
come
to
an

The
pillars
of
heaven
tremble
and
are
astonished
at

He
divideth
the
sea
with
his

by
his
understanding
he
smiteth
through
the
Job26:13
By
his
spirit
he
hath
garnished
the
his
hand
hath
formed
the
crooked
Job26:14
these
are
parts
of
his
but
how
little
a
portion
is
heard
of
but
the
thunder
of
his
power
who
can
understand

Job27:1
Moreover
Job
continued
his
and
Job27:2
As

God
forbid

My

Let

For

the
hope

hath

God
taketh

Will
God
hear

This
is
the
portion

wicked
man

the
heritage
of

shall
receive
of

If

Those
that
remain
of

be
buried

up
silver

He

prepare

just
shall
put

innocent
shall
divide

He
buildeth

Job27:19
The
rich

Terrors

The
east
wind
carrieth

hurleth
him
out

cast

fain
flee
out
of

Men
shall
clap
their
hands
at

hiss
him
out

Surely
there
is
a
vein
for
the
and
a
place
for
gold
where
they
fine

Iron
is
taken
out
of

molten
out

forgotten

He

He
cutteth

He
bindeth
the
floods
from

the
thing
that

hid
bringeth

forth

But
where
shall
wisdom
be

where
is
the
place

Job28:13
Man
knoweth
not

land

The
depth
It

It

be
weighed
for

It
cannot
be
valued
with
the
gold
of

the
precious

The
gold
and

crystal
cannot
equal

the
exchange

not
be

No

The
topaz

Whence
then
cometh
and
where
is
the
place
of
Job28:21
Seeing
it
is
hid
from
the
eyes
of
all
and
kept
close
from

fowls
of

Job28:22
Destruction
and
death
We
have
heard
the
fame
thereof
with
our
Job28:23
God
understandeth
the
way
and
he
knoweth
the
place
Job28:24
For
he
looketh
to
the
ends
of
the

seeth
under
the
whole
Job28:25
To
make
the
weight
for
the
and
he
weigheth
the
waters
by
Job28:26
When
he
made
a
decree
for
the
and
a
way
for
the
lightning
of
the
Job28:27
Then
did
he
see
and
declare
he
prepared

searched
it
Job28:28
And
unto
man
he
the
fear
of
the
that
is

to
depart
from
evil
is
Job29:1
Moreover
Job
continued
his
and
Job29:2
Oh
that
I
were
as
in
months
as
in
the
days

God
preserved
Job29:3
When
his
candle
shined
upon
my
and
when
by
his
light
I
walked
through
Job29:4
As
I
was
in
the
days
of
my
when
the
secret
of
God
was
upon
my
Job29:5
When
the
Almighty
was
yet
with
when
my
children
were
about
Job29:6
When
I
washed
my
steps
with
and
the
rock
poured
me
out
rivers
of
Job29:7
When
I
went
out
to
the
gate
through
the
when
I
prepared
my
seat
in
the
Job29:8
The
young
men
saw
and
hid
and
the
aged
and
stood
Job29:9
The
princes
refrained
and
laid
their
hand
on
their
Job29:10
The
nobles
held
their
and
their
tongue
cleaved
to
the
roof
of
their
Job29:11
When
the
ear
heard
then
it
blessed
and
when
the
eye
saw
it
gave
witness
to
Job29:12
Because
I
delivered
the
poor
that
and
the
and
him
that
had
none
to
help
Job29:13
The
blessing
of
him
that
was
ready
to
perish
came
upon
and
I
caused
the
widow's
heart
to
sing
for
Job29:14
I
put
on
and
it
clothed
my
judgment
was
as
a
robe
and
a
Job29:15
I
was
eyes
to
the
and
feet
was
I
to
the
Job29:16
I
was
a
father
to
the
and
the
cause
which
I
knew
not
I
searched
Job29:17
And
I
brake
the
jaws
of
the
and
plucked
the
spoil
out
of
his
Job29:18
Then
I
I
shall
die
in
my
and
I
shall
multiply
my
days
as
the
Job29:19
My
root
was
spread
out
by
the
and
the
dew
lay
all
night
upon
my
Job29:20
My
glory
was
fresh
in
and
my
bow
was
renewed
in
my
Job29:21
Unto
me
men
gave
and
and
kept
silence
at
my
Job29:22
After
my
words
they
spake
not
and
my
speech
dropped
upon
Job29:23
And
they
waited
for
me
as
for
the
and
they
opened
their
mouth
wide
as
for
the
latter
Job29:24
If
I
laughed
on
they
believed
it
and
the
light
of
my
countenance
they
cast
not
Job29:25
I
chose
out
their
and
sat
and
dwelt
as
a
king
in
the
as
one
that
comforteth
the
Job30:1
But
now
they
that
are
younger
than
I
have
me
in
whose
fathers
I
would
have
disdained
to
have
set
with
the
dogs
of
my
Job30:2
whereto
might
the
strength
of
their
hands
profit
in
whom
old
age
was
Job30:3
For
want
and
famine
they
were
fleeing
into
the
wilderness
in
former
time
desolate
and
Job30:4
Who
cut
up
mallows
by
the
and
juniper
roots
for
their
Job30:5
They
were
driven
forth
from
among
(they
cried
after
them
as
after
a
thief;)
Job30:6
To
dwell
in
the
cliffs
of
the
in
caves
of
the
and
in
the
Job30:7
Among
the
bushes
they
under
the
nettles
they
were
gathered
Job30:8
They
were
children
of
children
of
base
they
were
viler
than
the
Job30:9
And
now
am
I
their
I
am
their
Job30:10
They
abhor
they
flee
far
from
and
spare
not
to
spit
in
my
Job30:11
Because
he
hath
loosed
my
and
afflicted
they
have
also
let
loose
the
bridle
before
Job30:12
Upon
my
right
hand
rise
the
they
push
away
my
and
they
raise
up
against
me
the
ways
of
their
Job30:13
They
mar
my
they
set
forward
my
they
have
no
Job30:14
They
came
upon
me
as
a
wide
breaking
in
of
in
the
desolation
they
rolled
themselves
upon
Job30:15
Terrors
are
turned
upon
they
pursue
my
soul
as
the
and
my
welfare
passeth
away
as
a
Job30:16
And
now
my
soul
is
poured
out
upon
the
days
of
affliction
have
taken
hold
upon
Job30:17
My
bones
are
pierced
in
me
in
the
night
and
my
sinews
take
no
Job30:18
By
the
great
force
of
my
disease
is
my
garment
it
bindeth
me
about
as
the
collar
of
my
Job30:19
He
hath
cast
me
into
the
and
I
am
become
like
dust
and
Job30:20
I
cry
unto
and
thou
dost
not
hear
I
stand
and
thou
regardest
me
Job30:21
Thou
art
become
cruel
to
with
thy
strong
hand
thou
opposest
thyself
against
Job30:22
Thou
liftest
me
up
to
the
thou
causest
me
to
ride
upon
and
dissolvest
my
Job30:23
For
I
know
that
thou
wilt
bring
me
to
and
to
the
house
appointed
for
all
Job30:24
Howbeit
he
will
not
stretch
out
his
hand
to
the
though
they
cry
in
his
Job30:25
Did
not
I
weep
for
him
that
was
in
was
not
my
soul
grieved
for
the
Job30:26
When
I
looked
for
then
evil
came
unto
and
when
I
waited
for
there
came
Job30:27
My
bowels
and
rested
the
days
of
affliction
prevented
Job30:28
I
went
mourning
without
the
I
stood
and
I
cried
in
the
Job30:29
I
am
a
brother
to
and
a
companion
to
Job30:30
My
skin
is
black
upon
and
my
bones
are
burned
with
Job30:31
My
harp
also
is
turned
to
and
my
organ
into
the
voice
of
them
that
Job31:1
I
made
a
covenant
with
mine
why
then
should
I
think
upon
a
Job31:2
For
what
portion
of
God
is
there
from
and
what
inheritance
of
the
Almighty
from
on
Job31:3
Is
not
destruction
to
the
and
a
strange
punishment
to
the
workers
of
Job31:4
Doth
not
he
see
my
and
count
all
my
Job31:5
If
I
have
walked
with
or
if
my
foot
hath
hasted
to
Job31:6
Let
me
be
weighed
in
an
even
balance
that
God
may
know
mine
Job31:7
If
my
step
hath
turned
out
of
the
and
mine
heart
walked
after
mine
and
if
any
blot
hath
cleaved
to
mine
Job31:8
Then
let
me
and
let
another
let
my
offspring
be
rooted
Job31:9
If
mine
heart
have
been
deceived
by
a
or
if
I
have
laid
wait
at
my
neighbour's
Job31:10
Then
let
my
wife
grind
unto
and
let
others
bow
down
upon
Job31:11
For
this
is
an
heinous
it
is
an
iniquity
to
be
punished
by
the
Job31:12
For
it
is
a
fire
that
consumeth
to
and
would
root
out
all
mine
Job31:13
If
I
did
despise
the
cause
of
my
manservant
or
of
my
when
they
contended
with
Job31:14
What
then
shall
I
do
when
God
riseth
and
when
he
visiteth,
what
shall
I
answer
Job31:15
Did
not
he
that
made
me
in
the
womb
make
and
did
not
one
fashion
us
in
the
Job31:16
If
I
have
withheld
the
poor
from
their
or
have
caused
the
eyes
of
the
widow
to
Job31:17
Or
have
eaten
my
morsel
myself
and
the
fatherless
hath
not
eaten
Job31:18
(For
from
my
youth
he
was
brought
up
with
as
with
a
and
I
have
guided
her
from
my
mother's
womb;)
Job31:19
If
I
have
seen
any
perish
for
want
of
or
any
poor
without
Job31:20
If
his
loins
have
not
blessed
and
if
he
were
not
warmed
with
the
fleece
of
my
Job31:21
If
I
have
lifted
up
my
hand
against
the
when
I
saw
my
help
in
the
Job31:22
Then
let
mine
arm
fall
from
my
shoulder
and
mine
arm
be
broken
from
the
Job31:23
For
destruction
from
God
was
a
terror
to
and
by
reason
of
his
highness
I
could
not
Job31:24
If
I
have
made
gold
my
or
have
said
to
the
fine
Thou
art
my
Job31:25
If
I
rejoiced
because
my
wealth
was
and
because
mine
hand
had
gotten
Job31:26
If
I
beheld
the
sun
when
it
or
the
moon
walking
in
Job31:27
And
my
heart
hath
been
secretly
or
my
mouth
hath
kissed
my
Job31:28
This
also
were
an
iniquity
to
be
punished
by
the
for
I
should
have
denied
the
God
that
is
Job31:29
If
I
rejoiced
at
the
destruction
of
him
that
hated
or
lifted
up
myself
when
evil
found
Job31:30
Neither
have
I
suffered
my
mouth
to
sin
by
wishing
a
curse
to
his
Job31:31
If
the
men
of
my
tabernacle
said
Oh
that
we
had
of
his
we
cannot
be
Job31:32
The
stranger
did
not
lodge
in
the
but
I
opened
my
doors
to
the
Job31:33
If
I
covered
my
transgressions
as
by
hiding
mine
iniquity
in
my
Job31:34
Did
I
fear
a
great
or
did
the
contempt
of
families
terrify
that
I
kept
and
went
not
out
of
the
doo
r?
Job31:35
Oh
that
one
would
hear
my
desire
that
the
Almighty
would
answer
and
that
mine
adversary
had
written
a
Job31:36
Surely
I
would
take
it
upon
my
and
bind
it
as
a
crown
to
Job31:37
I
would
declare
unto
him
the
number
of
my
as
a
prince
would
I
go
near
unto
Job31:38
If
my
land
cry
against
or
that
the
furrows
likewise
thereof
Job31:39
If
I
have
eaten
the
fruits
thereof
without
or
have
caused
the
owners
thereof
to
lose
their
Job31:40
Let
thistles
grow
instead
of
and
cockle
instead
of
The
words
of
Job
are
Job32:1
So
these
three
men
ceased
to
answer
because
he
was
righteous
in
his
own
Job32:2
Then
was
kindled
the
wrath
of
Elihu
the
son
of
Barachel
the
Buzite,
of
the
kindred
of
against
Job
was
his
wrath
kindle
d,
because
he
justified
himself
rather
than
Job32:3
Also
against
his
three
friends
was
his
wrath
because
they
had
found
no
and
yet
had
condemned
Job32:4
Now
Elihu
had
waited
till
Job
had
because
they
were
elder
than
Job32:5
When
Elihu
saw
that
there
was
no
answer
in
the
mouth
of
these
three
then
his
wrath
was
Job32:6
And
Elihu
the
son
of
Barachel
the
Buzite
answered
and
I
am
and
ye
are
very
wherefore
I
was
and
du
rst
not
shew
you
mine
Job32:7
I
Days
should
and
multitude
of
years
should
teach
Job32:8
But
there
is
a
spirit
in
and
the
inspiration
of
the
Almighty
giveth
them
Job32:9
Great
men
are
not
always
neither
do
the
aged
understand
Job32:10
Therefore
I
Hearken
to
I
also
will
shew
mine
Job32:11
I
waited
for
your
I
gave
ear
to
your
whilst
ye
searched
out
what
to
Job32:12
I
attended
unto
there
was
none
of
you
that
convinced
or
that
answered
his
Job32:13
Lest
ye
should
We
have
found
out
God
thrusteth
him
not
Job32:14
Now
he
hath
not
directed
his
words
against
neither
will
I
answer
him
with
your
Job32:15
They
were
they
answered
no
they
left
off
Job32:16
When
I
had
(for
they
spake
but
stood
and
answered
no
more;)
Job32:17
I
I
will
answer
also
my
I
also
will
shew
mine
Job32:18
For
I
am
full
of
the
spirit
within
me
constraineth
Job32:19
my
belly
is
as
wine
which
hath
no
it
is
ready
to
burst
like
new
Job32:20
I
will
that
I
may
be
I
will
open
my
lips
and
Job32:21
Let
me
I
pray
accept
any
man's
neither
let
me
give
flattering
titles
unto
Job32:22
For
I
know
not
to
give
flattering
in
so
doing
my
maker
would
soon
take
me
Job33:1
I
pray
hear
my
and
hearken
to
all
my
Job33:2
now
I
have
opened
my
my
tongue
hath
spoken
in
my
Job33:3
My
words
shall
be
of
the
uprightness
of
my
and
my
lips
shall
utter
knowledge
Job33:4
The
spirit
of
God
hath
made
and
the
breath
of
the
Almighty
hath
given
me
Job33:5
If
thou
canst
answer
set
thy
words
in
order
before
stand
Job33:6
I
am
according
to
thy
wish
in
God's
I
also
am
formed
out
of
the
Job33:7
my
terror
shall
not
make
thee
neither
shall
my
hand
be
heavy
upon
Job33:8
Surely
thou
hast
spoken
in
mine
and
I
have
heard
the
voice
of
thy
Job33:9
I
am
clean
without
I
am
neither
is
there
iniquity
in
Job33:10
he
findeth
occasions
against
he
counteth
me
for
his
Job33:11
He
putteth
my
feet
in
the
he
marketh
all
my
Job33:12
in
this
thou
art
not
I
will
answer
that
God
is
greater
than
Job33:13
Why
dost
thou
strive
against
for
he
giveth
not
account
of
any
of
his
Job33:14
For
God
speaketh
yea
yet
man
perceiveth
it
Job33:15
In
a
in
a
vision
of
the
when
deep
sleep
falleth
upon
in
slumberings
upon
the
Job33:16
Then
he
openeth
the
ears
of
and
sealeth
their
Job33:17
That
he
may
withdraw
man
from
his
and
hide
pride
from
Job33:18
He
keepeth
back
his
soul
from
the
and
his
life
from
perishing
by
the
Job33:19
He
is
chastened
also
with
pain
upon
his
and
the
multitude
of
his
bones
with
strong
Job33:20
So
that
his
life
abhorreth
and
his
soul
dainty
Job33:21
His
flesh
is
consumed
that
it
cannot
be
and
his
bones
that
were
not
seen
stick
Job33:22
his
soul
draweth
near
unto
the
and
his
life
to
the
Job33:23
If
there
be
a
messenger
with
an
one
among
a
to
shew
unto
man
his
Job33:24
Then
he
is
gracious
unto
and
Deliver
him
from
going
down
to
the
I
have
found
a
Job33:25
His
flesh
shall
be
fresher
than
a
he
shall
return
to
the
days
of
his
Job33:26
He
shall
pray
unto
and
he
will
be
favourable
unto
and
he
shall
see
his
face
with
for
he
will
render
unto
ma

his
Job33:27
He
looketh
upon
and
if
any
I
have
and
perverted
that
which
was
and
it
profited
me
Job33:28
He
will
deliver
his
soul
from
going
into
the
and
his
life
shall
see
the
Job33:29
all
these
things
worketh
God
oftentimes
with
Job33:30
To
bring
back
his
soul
from
the
to
be
enlightened
with
the
light
of
the
Job33:31
Mark
O
hearken
unto
hold
thy
and
I
will
Job33:32
If
thou
hast
anything
to
answer
for
I
desire
to
justify
Job33:33
If
hearken
unto
hold
thy
and
I
shall
teach
thee
Job34:1
Furthermore
Elihu
answered
and
Job34:2
Hear
my
O
ye
wise
and
give
ear
unto
ye
that
have
Job34:3
For
the
ear
trieth
as
the
mouth
tasteth
Job34:4
Let
us
choose
to
us
let
us
know
among
ourselves
what
is
Job34:5
For
Job
hath
I
am
and
God
hath
taken
away
my
Job34:6
Should
I
lie
against
my
my
wound
is
incurable
without
Job34:7
What
man
is
like
who
drinketh
up
scorning
like
Job34:8
Which
goeth
in
company
with
the
workers
of
and
walketh
with
wicked
Job34:9
For
he
hath
It
profiteth
a
man
nothing
that
he
should
delight
himself
with
Job34:10
Therefore
hearken
unto
me
ye
men
of
far
be
it
from
that
he
should
do
and
from
the
Almighty
,
that
he
should
commit
Job34:11
For
the
work
of
a
man
shall
he
render
unto
and
cause
every
man
to
find
according
to
his
Job34:12
surely
God
will
not
do
neither
will
the
Almighty
pervert
Job34:13
Who
hath
given
him
a
charge
over
the
or
who
hath
disposed
the
whole
Job34:14
If
he
set
his
heart
upon
if
he
gather
unto
himself
his
spirit
and
his
Job34:15
All
flesh
shall
perish
and
man
shall
turn
again
unto
Job34:16
If
now
thou
hast
hear
hearken
to
the
voice
of
my
Job34:17
Shall
even
he
that
hateth
right
and
wilt
thou
condemn
him
that
is
most
Job34:18
Is
it
fit
to
say
to
a
Thou
art
and
to
Ye
are
Job34:19
How
much
less
to
him
that
accepteth
not
the
persons
of
nor
regardeth
the
rich
more
than
the
for
they
all
ar
e
the
work
of
his
Job34:20
In
a
moment
shall
they
and
the
people
shall
be
troubled
at
and
pass
and
the
mighty
shall
be
taken
awa
y
without
Job34:21
For
his
eyes
are
upon
the
ways
of
and
he
seeth
all
his
Job34:22
There
is
no
nor
shadow
of
where
the
workers
of
iniquity
may
hide
Job34:23
For
he
will
not
lay
upon
man
more
than
that
he
should
enter
into
judgment
with
Job34:24
He
shall
break
in
pieces
mighty
men
without
and
set
others
in
their
Job34:25
Therefore
he
knoweth
their
and
he
overturneth
them
in
the
so
that
they
are
Job34:26
He
striketh
them
as
wicked
men
in
the
open
sight
of
Job34:27
Because
they
turned
back
from
and
would
not
consider
any
of
his
Job34:28
So
that
they
cause
the
cry
of
the
poor
to
come
unto
and
he
heareth
the
cry
of
the
Job34:29
When
he
giveth
who
then
can
make
and
when
he
hideth
his
who
then
can
behold
whether
it
be
d
one
against
a
or
against
a
man
Job34:30
That
the
hypocrite
reign
lest
the
people
be
Job34:31
Surely
it
is
meet
to
be
said
unto
I
have
borne
I
will
not
offend
any
Job34:32
That
which
I
see
not
teach
thou
if
I
have
done
I
will
do
no
Job34:33
Should
it
be
according
to
thy
he
will
recompense
whether
thou
or
whether
thou
and
not
therefo
re
speak
what
thou
knowest.
Job34:34
Let
men
of
understanding
tell
and
let
a
wise
man
hearken
unto
Job34:35
Job
hath
spoken
without
and
his
words
were
without
Job34:36
My
desire
is
that
Job
may
be
tried
unto
the
end
because
of
his
answers
for
wicked
Job34:37
For
he
addeth
rebellion
unto
his
he
clappeth
his
hands
among
and
multiplieth
his
words
against
Job35:1
Elihu
spake
and
Job35:2
Thinkest
thou
this
to
be
that
thou
saidst,
My
righteousness
is
more
than
Job35:3
For
thou
saidst,
What
advantage
will
it
be
unto
What
profit
shall
I
if
I
be
cleansed
from
my
Job35:4
I
will
answer
and
thy
companions
with
Job35:5
Look
unto
the
and
and
behold
the
clouds
which
are
higher
than
Job35:6
If
thou
sinnest,
what
doest
thou
against
or
if
thy
transgressions
be
what
doest
thou
unto
Job35:7
If
thou
be
what
givest
thou
or
what
receiveth
he
of
thine
Job35:8
Thy
wickedness
may
hurt
a
man
as
thou
and
thy
righteousness
may
profit
the
son
of
Job35:9
By
reason
of
the
multitude
of
oppressions
they
make
the
oppressed
to
they
cry
out
by
reason
of
the
arm
of
the
Job35:10
But
none
Where
is
God
my
who
giveth
songs
in
the
Job35:11
Who
teacheth
us
more
than
the
beasts
of
the
and
maketh
us
wiser
than
the
fowls
of
Job35:12
There
they
but
none
giveth
because
of
the
pride
of
evil
Job35:13
Surely
God
will
not
hear
neither
will
the
Almighty
regard
Job35:14
Although
thou
sayest
thou
shalt
not
see
yet
judgment
is
before
therefore
trust
thou
in
Job35:15
But
because
it
is
not
he
hath
visited
in
his
yet
he
knoweth
it
not
in
great
Job35:16
Therefore
doth
Job
open
his
mouth
in
he
multiplieth
words
without
Job36:1
Elihu
also
and
Job36:2
Suffer
me
a
and
I
will
shew
thee
that
I
have
yet
to
speak
on
God's
Job36:3
I
will
fetch
my
knowledge
from
and
will
ascribe
righteousness
to
my
Job36:4
For
truly
my
words
shall
not
be
he
that
is
perfect
in
knowledge
is
with
Job36:5
God
is
and
despiseth
not
he
is
mighty
in
strength
and
Job36:6
He
preserveth
not
the
life
of
the
but
giveth
right
to
the
Job36:7
He
withdraweth
not
his
eyes
from
the
but
with
kings
are
they
on
the
he
doth
establish
them
for
ever
,
and
they
are
Job36:8
And
if
they
be
bound
in
and
be
holden
in
cords
of
Job36:9
Then
he
sheweth
them
their
and
their
transgressions
that
they
have
Job36:10
He
openeth
also
their
ear
to
and
commandeth
that
they
return
from
Job36:11
If
they
obey
and
serve
they
shall
spend
their
days
in
and
their
years
in
Job36:12
But
if
they
obey
they
shall
perish
by
the
and
they
shall
die
without
Job36:13
But
the
hypocrites
in
heart
heap
up
they
cry
not
when
he
bindeth
Job36:14
They
die
in
and
their
life
is
among
the
Job36:15
He
delivereth
the
poor
in
his
and
openeth
their
ears
in
Job36:16
Even
so
would
he
have
removed
thee
out
of
the
strait
into
a
broad
where
there
is
no
and
that
which
shou
ld
be
set
on
thy
table
should
be
full
of
Job36:17
But
thou
hast
fulfilled
the
judgment
of
the
judgment
and
justice
take
hold
on
Job36:18
Because
there
is
beware
lest
he
take
thee
away
with
his
then
a
great
ransom
cannot
deliver
Job36:19
Will
he
esteem
thy
not
nor
all
the
forces
of
Job36:20
Desire
not
the
when
people
are
cut
off
in
their
Job36:21
Take
regard
not
for
this
hast
thou
chosen
rather
than
Job36:22
God
exalteth
by
his
who
teacheth
like
Job36:23
Who
hath
enjoined
him
his
or
who
can
Thou
hast
wrought
Job36:24
Remember
that
thou
magnify
his
which
men
Job36:25
Every
man
may
see
man
may
behold
it
afar
Job36:26
God
is
and
we
know
him
neither
can
the
number
of
his
years
be
searched
Job36:27
For
he
maketh
small
the
drops
of
they
pour
down
rain
according
to
the
vapour
Job36:28
Which
the
clouds
do
drop
and
distil
upon
man
Job36:29
Also
can
any
understand
the
spreadings
of
the
or
the
noise
of
his
Job36:30
he
spreadeth
his
light
upon
and
covereth
the
bottom
of
the
Job36:31
For
by
them
judgeth
he
the
he
giveth
meat
in
Job36:32
With
clouds
he
covereth
the
and
commandeth
it
not
to
shine
by
the
cloud
that
cometh
Job36:33
The
noise
thereof
sheweth
concerning
the
cattle
also
concerning
the
Job37:1
At
this
also
my
heart
trembleth,
and
is
moved
out
of
his
Job37:2
Hear
attentively
the
noise
of
his
and
the
sound
that
goeth
out
of
his
Job37:3
He
directeth
it
under
the
whole
and
his
lightning
unto
the
ends
of
the
Job37:4
After
it
a
voice
roareth:
he
thundereth
with
the
voice
of
his
and
he
will
not
stay
them
when
his
voice
is
heard
.
Job37:5
God
thundereth
marvellously
with
his
great
things
doeth
which
we
cannot
Job37:6
For
he
saith
to
the
Be
thou
on
the
likewise
to
the
small
and
to
the
great
rain
of
his
Job37:7
He
sealeth
up
the
hand
of
every
that
all
men
may
know
his
Job37:8
Then
the
beasts
go
into
and
remain
in
their
Job37:9
Out
of
the
south
cometh
the
and
cold
out
of
the
Job37:10
By
the
breath
of
God
frost
is
and
the
breadth
of
the
waters
is
Job37:11
Also
by
watering
he
wearieth
the
thick
he
scattereth
his
bright
Job37:12
And
it
is
turned
round
about
by
his
that
they
may
do
whatsoever
he
commandeth
them
upon
the
face
of
the
world
in
the
Job37:13
He
causeth
it
to
whether
for
or
for
his
or
for
Job37:14
Hearken
unto
O
stand
and
consider
the
wondrous
works
of
Job37:15
Dost
thou
know
when
God
disposed
and
caused
the
light
of
his
cloud
to
Job37:16
Dost
thou
know
the
balancings
of
the
the
wondrous
works
of
him
which
is
perfect
in
Job37:17
How
thy
garments
are
when
he
quieteth
the
earth
by
the
south
Job37:18
Hast
thou
with
him
spread
out
the
which
is
and
as
a
molten
looking
Job37:19
Teach
us
what
we
shall
say
unto
for
we
cannot
order
our
speech
by
reason
of
Job37:20
Shall
it
be
told
him
that
I
if
a
man
surely
he
shall
be
swallowed
Job37:21
And
now
men
see
not
the
bright
light
which
is
in
the
but
the
wind
passeth,
and
cleanseth
Job37:22
Fair
weather

out
of

terrible
Job37:23
Touching
the
we
cannot
find
him
he
is
excellent
in
and
in
and
in
plenty
of

wil
l
not
Job37:24
Men
do
therefore
fear
he
respecteth
not
any
that
are
wise
of
Job38:1
Then
the
LORD
answered
Job
out
of

and
Job38:2
Who
is
this
that
darkeneth
counsel
by
words
without
Job38:3
Gird
up
now
thy
loins
like

Job38:4
Where
wast
thou
when
I
laid
the
foundations
of

Who
hath
laid
the
measures
if
thou
knowest?
or
who
hath
stretched
the
line
upon
Job38:6
Whereupon
are
the
foundations
thereof
or
who
laid
the
corner
stone
Job38:7
When
the
morning
stars
sang
and
all
the
sons
of
God
shouted
for
Job38:8
Or
who
shut
up
the
sea
with
when
it
brake
as
if
it
had
issued
out
of

When
I
made

thick
darkness
a
swaddlingband
for
Job38:10
And
brake
up
for
it
my
decreed

And
Hitherto
shalt
thou

no

here
shall
thy
proud
waves
be

Hast
thou
commanded
the
morning
since
thy

caused
the
dayspring
to

That
it
might
take
hold
of

ends
of

the
wicked

be
shaken
out
of

It
is
turned
as
clay
to

they
stand
as

And
from
the
wicked
their
light
is
withholden,

Hast

been

From

Her

Moreover
the
LORD
answered

Job40:2
Shall
he
that
contendeth
with
the
Almighty
instruct
he
that

him

Job40:3
Then
Job
answered

I

Once

Then
answered
the
LORD
unto
Job
out

Job40:7
Gird
up

Wilt

Hast
thou

like

Deck
thyself
now
with
majesty

array

Cast

Look

Hide
them
in

dust

bind

in

Then
will
I
also
confess
unto
thee
that
thine

Behold

His

He

The

None

Who

They

By

Out
of

go
burning
and
sparks
of
fire
leap
Job41:20
Out
of

In

Job41:27
He
esteemeth

Job41:28
The

are
turned

Sharp

He

Upon

Job41:34
He
beholdeth
all

is
a
king
over
all
the
children
of
Job42:1
Then
Job
answered
the
and
Job42:2
I
know
that
thou
canst
do
every
and
that
no
thought
can
be
withholden
from
Job42:3
Who
is
he
that
hideth
counsel
without
therefore
have
I
uttered
that
I
understood
things
too
wonderful
for
m
e,
which
I
knew
Job42:4
I
beseech
and
I
will
I
will
demand
of
and
declare
thou
unto
Job42:5
I
have
heard
of
thee
by
the
hearing
of
the
but
now
mine
eye
seeth
Job42:6
Wherefore
I
abhor
and
repent
in
dust
and
Job42:7
And
it
was
that
after
the
LORD
had
spoken
these
words
unto
the
LORD
said
to
Eliphaz
the
Temanite,
My
wrath
is
kind
led
against
and
against
thy
two
for
ye
have
not
spoken
of
me
the
thing
that
is
as
my
servant
Job
Job42:8
Therefore
take
unto
you
now
seven
bullocks
and
seven
and
go
to
my
servant
and
offer
up
for
yourselves
a
burnt
of
and
my
servant
Job
shall
pray
for
for
him
will
I
lest
I
deal
with
you
after
your
in
that
ye
have
not
sp
oken
of
me
the
thing
which
is
like
my
servant
Job42:9
So
Eliphaz
the
Temanite
and
Bildad
the
Shuhite
and
Zophar
the
Naamathite
and
did
according
as
the
LORD
commanded
them
:
the
LORD
also
accepted
Job42:10
And
the
LORD
turned
the
captivity
of
when
he
prayed
for
his
also
the
LORD
gave
Job
twice
as
much
as
he
had
b
efore.
Job42:11
Then
came
there
unto
him
all
his
and
all
his
and
all
they
that
had
been
of
his
acquaintance
and
did
eat
bread
with
him
in
his
and
they
bemoaned
and
comforted
him
over
all
the
evil
that
the
LORD
had
brought
upon
him
:
every
man
also
gave
him
a
piece
of
and
every
one
an
earring
of
Job42:12
So
the
LORD
blessed
the
latter
end
of
Job
more
than
his
for
he
had
fourteen
thousand
and
six
thousand
ca
mels,
and
a
thousand
yoke
of
and
a
thousand
she
Job42:13
He
had
also
seven
sons
and
three
Job42:14
And
he
called
the
name
of
the
Jemima;
and
the
name
of
the
Kezia;
and
the
name
of
the
Kerenhappuch.
Job42:15
And
in
all
the
land
were
no
women
found
so
fair
as
the
daughters
of
and
their
father
gave
them
inheritance
among
thei
r
Job42:16
After
this
lived
Job
an
hundred
and
forty
and
saw
his
and
his
even
four
Job42:17
So
Job
being
old
and
full
of
Psa1:1
Blessed
is
the
man
that
walketh
not
in
the
counsel
of
the
nor
standeth
in
the
way
of
nor
sitteth
in
the
se
at
of
the
Psa1:2
But
his
delight
is
in
the
law
of
the
and
in
his
law
doth
he
meditate
day
and
Psa1:3
And
he
shall
be
like
a
tree
planted
by
the
rivers
of
that
bringeth
forth
his
fruit
in
his
his
leaf
also
shall
not
and
whatsoever
he
doeth
shall
Psa1:4
The
ungodly
are
not
but
are
like
the
chaff
which
the
wind
driveth
Psa1:5
Therefore
the
ungodly
shall
not
stand
in
the
nor
sinners
in
the
congregation
of
the
Psa1:6
For
the
LORD
knoweth
the
way
of
the
but
the
way
of
the
ungodly
shall
Psa2:1
Why
do
the
heathen
and
the
people
imagine
a
vain
Psa2:2
The
kings
of
the
earth
set
and
the
rulers
take
counsel
against
the
and
against
his
say
ing,
Psa2:3
Let
us
break
their
bands
and
cast
away
their
cords
from
Psa2:4
He
that
sitteth
in
the
heavens
shall
the
LORD
shall
have
them
in
Psa2:5
Then
shall
he
speak
unto
them
in
his
and
vex
them
in
his
sore
Psa2:6
Yet
have
I
set
my
king
upon
my
holy
hill
of
Psa2:7
I
will
declare
the
the
LORD
hath
said
unto
Thou
art
my
this
day
have
I
begotten
Psa2:8
Ask
of
and
I
shall
give
thee
the
heathen
for
thine
and
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
earth
for
thy
Psa2:9
Thou
shalt
break
them
with
a
rod
of
thou
shalt
dash
them
in
pieces
like
a
potter's
Psa2:10
Be
wise
now
O
ye
be
ye
judges
of
the
Psa2:11
Serve
the
LORD
with
and
rejoice
with
Psa2:12
Kiss
the
lest
he
be
and
ye
perish
from
the
when
his
wrath
is
kindled
but
a
Blessed
are
all
they
th
at
put
their
trust
in
Psa3:1
how
are
they
increased
that
trouble
many
are
they
that
rise
up
against
Psa3:2
Many
there
be
which
say
of
my
There
is
no
help
for
him
in
Psa3:3
But
O
art
a
shield
for
my
and
the
lifter
up
of
mine
Psa3:4
I
cried
unto
the
LORD
with
my
and
he
heard
me
out
of
his
holy
Psa3:5
I
laid
me
down
and
I
for
the
LORD
sustained
Psa3:6
I
will
not
be
afraid
of
ten
thousands
of
that
have
set
themselves
against
me
round
Psa3:7
O
save
O
my
for
thou
hast
smitten
all
mine
enemies
upon
the
cheek
thou
hast
broken
the
teeth
of
the
Psa3:8
Salvation
belongeth
unto
the
thy
blessing
is
upon
thy

Hear
me
when

O
God
of
my

hast
enlarged
me
when
I
was

mercy
upon

O
ye
sons
of
how
long
will
ye
turn
my
glory
into
how
long
will
ye
love
and
seek
after
Psa4:3
But
know
that
the
LORD
hath
set
apart
him
that
is
godly
for
the
LORD
will
hear
when
I
call
unto
Psa4:4
Stand
in

with
your
own
heart
upon
your

Offer
the
sacrifices

There

many
that
Who
will
shew
us
any

thou
up
the
light
of
thy
countenance
upon

Thou
hast
put
gladness
in
my
more
than
in
the
time
that
their
corn

their
wine
Psa4:8
I
will
both
lay

down
in

The

But

Lead

But

O

Out

When
I

thou
hast
Psa8:4
What
is
that
thou
art
mindful
of
and
the
son
of
that
thou
visitest
Psa8:5
For
thou
hast
made
him
a
little
lower
than
the

hast
crowned
him
with
glory
and
Psa8:6
Thou
madest
him
to
have
dominion
over
the
works
of

put
all

All

Psa9:3
When
mine
enemies
are
turned

Psa9:4
For

hast
maintained
my
right

satest
in

throne
judging
Psa9:5
Thou
hast
rebuked

Psa9:6
O
thou
destructions

Psa9:7
But

The

liftest
me
up

Then
the
earth
shook
and
the
foundations
also
of
the
hills
moved
and
were
because
he
was

There
went
up

smoke
out
of

out
of
his
mouth

were
kindled
by

He
bowed

came

darkness
was

And
he
rode
upon

thundered

Then
the
channels
of

He
sent

drew
me
out

delivered
me
from

from

which
hated

were
too
strong
for

They
prevented
me

He
brought
me
forth
also
into
a
large

delivered

he
delighted
in

The
LORD
rewarded
me
according
to
my

recompensed

For
I

kept
the

not

away

statutes
from

I
was
also
upright
before

I
kept
myself
from
mine

recompensed
me

For
thou
hast
girded
me
with
strength
unto

hast
subdued
under
me
those
that
rose
up
against

Thou
hast
also
given
me

there
was
none

Then
did
I
beat
them
small
as

did
cast
them
out
as

Thou
hast
delivered
me
from

hast
made

As

The

The

The

Psa21:2
Thou
hast
given
him
his

hast
not
withholden
the
request
of
his
Psa21:3
For
thou
preventest
him

the
blessings
of

settest
a
crown
of
pure
gold
on

He
asked

His
glory

Their

But
thou

took
me
out

My

Psa26:5
I
have
hated
the
congregation
of

Gather

One
thing
have
I
desired
of

I
seek
that
I
may
dwell
in
the
house
of
the
LORD
all
the
days
of

behold
the
beauty
of

to
enquire
in

For
in
the
time
of
trouble
he

hide
me
in
his

the
secret
of
his
tabernacle

he
hide
he
shall
set
me
up
upon
a

And
now
shall
mine
head
be
lifted
up
above
mine
enemies
round
about
therefore
will
I
offer
in
his
tabernacle
sacrifices
of

will
I
will
sing
praises
unto

O
when
I
cry
with

When

saidst,
Seek

When
my

will
take
me

Teach
me
thy

lead
me
in
a
plain

Deliver

Oh
how

laid
up
for

that
fear
which
thou
hast
wrought
for

For

Take

Let

put
to
shame
that

turned
back

brought
to
confusion
that

Let

Let
their
way
be
dark

the
angel

For
without

hid
for
me
their
net
in
a
which
without
cause
they
have
digged
for
my
Psa35:8
Let
destruction

very
destruction

And
my

All

deliverest
the
poor

him
that
is
too
strong
for
t
he
poor

the
needy
from
him
that
spoileth
Psa35:11
False
witnesses
did
rise
they
laid
to
my
charge
things
that
I
knew
Psa35:12
They
rewarded
me
evil
for
good
to
the
spoiling
of
my
Psa35:13
But
as
for
when
they
were
my
clothing
was
I
humbled
my
soul
with

my
prayer
returned
into
mine
own
Psa35:14
I
behaved
myself
as
though
he
had
been
my
friend
or
I
bowed
down
as
one
that
mourneth
for
his
Psa35:15
But
in
mine
adversity
they
and
gathered
themselves
the
abjects
gathered
themselves
together
again
st
and
I
knew
it
they
did
tear
and
ceased
Psa35:16
With
hypocritical
mockers
in
they
gnashed
upon
me
with
their
Psa35:17
how
long
wilt
thou
look
rescue
my
soul
from
their
my
darling
from
the
Psa35:18
I
will
give
thee
thanks
in
the
great
I
will
praise
thee
among
much
Psa35:19
Let
not
them
that
are
mine
enemies
wrongfully
rejoice
over
neither
let
them
wink
with
the
eye
that
hate
me
without
a
c
ause.
Psa35:20
For
they
speak
not
but
they
devise
deceitful
matters
against
them
that
are
quiet
in
the
Psa35:21
they
opened
their
mouth
wide
against
and
our
eye
hath
seen
Psa35:22
This
thou
hast
O
keep
not
O
be
not
far
from

Stir
up

awake
to

Psa35:24
Judge
O
LORD
my
according
to
thy

let
them
not

Let
them
not

their
so
would
we
have

them
not
We
have
swallowed
him
Psa35:26
Let
them
be
ashamed
and
brought
to
confusion
together
that
rejoice
at
mine
let

be
clothed
with
shame
and
dishon

Let

Let
the
LORD
be
magnif

which
hath
pleasure
in
the
prosperity
of
his
Psa35:28
And
my
tongue
shall
speak
of
thy
righteousness
and
of
thy
praise
all
the
day
Psa36:1
The
transgression
of
the
wicked
saith
within
my
that
there
is
no
fear
of
God
before
his
Psa36:2
For
he
flattereth
himself
in
his
own
until
his
iniquity
be
found
to
be
Psa36:3
The
words
of
his
mouth
are
iniquity
and
he
hath
left
off
to
be
and
to
do

He
deviseth
mischief
upon
his

setteth
himself

Thy
O

faithfulness
reacheth

Thy
righteousness
is

great
thy
judgments

How
excellent
is
thy
lovingkindness,
O
therefore
the
children
of
men
put
their
trust
under
the
shadow
of
thy
Psa36:8
They
shall
be
abundantly
satisfied
with
the
fatness
of
thy
and
thou
shalt
make
them
drink
of
the
river
of
thy
pleasu
Psa36:9
For
with
thee
is
the
fountain
of
in
thy
light
shall
we
see
Psa36:10
O
continue
thy
lovingkindness
unto
them
that
know
and
thy
righteousness
to
the
upright
in
Psa36:11
Let
not
the
foot
of
pride
come
against
and
let
not
the
hand
of
the
wicked
remove
Psa36:12
There
are
the
workers
of
iniquity
they
are
cast
and
shall
not
be
able
to
Psa37:1
Fret
not
thyself
because
of
neither
be
thou
envious
against
the
workers
of
Psa37:2
For
they
shall
soon
be
cut
down
like
the
and
wither
as
the
green
Psa37:3
Trust
in
the
and
do
so
shalt
thou
dwell
in
the
and
verily
thou
shalt
be
Psa37:4
Delight
thyself
also
in
the
and
he
shall
give
thee
the
desires
of
thine
Psa37:5
Commit
thy
way
unto
the
trust
also
in
and
he
shall
bring
it
to
Psa37:6
And
he
shall
bring
forth
thy
righteousness
as
the
and
thy
judgment
as
the
Psa37:7
Rest
in
the
and
wait
patiently
for
fret
not
thyself
because
of
him
who
prospereth
in
his
because
of
the
man
who
bringeth
wicked
devices
to
Psa37:8
Cease
from
and
forsake
fret
not
thyself
in
any
wise
to
do
Psa37:9
For
evildoers
shall
be
cut
but
those
that
wait
upon
the
they
shall
inherit
the
Psa37:10
For
yet
a
little
and
the
wicked
shall
not
thou
shalt
diligently
consider
his
and
it
shall
not
Psa37:11
But
the
meek
shall
inherit
the
and
shall
delight
themselves
in
the
abundance
of
Psa37:12
The
wicked
plotteth
against
the
and
gnasheth
upon
him
with
his
Psa37:13
The
LORD
shall
laugh
at
for
he
seeth
that
his
day
is
Psa37:14
The
wicked
have
drawn
out
the
and
have
bent
their
to
cast
down
the
poor
and
and
to
slay
such
as
be
of
u
pright
Psa37:15
Their
sword
shall
enter
into
their
own
and
their
bows
shall
be
Psa37:16
A
little
that
a
righteous
man
hath
is
better
than
the
riches
of
many
Psa37:17
For
the
arms
of
the
wicked
shall
be
but
the
LORD
upholdeth
the
Psa37:18
The
LORD
knoweth
the
days
of
the
and
their
inheritance
shall
be
for
Psa37:19
They
shall
not
be
ashamed
in
the
evil
and
in
the
days
of
famine
they
shall
be
Psa37:20
But
the
wicked
shall
and
the
enemies
of
the
LORD
shall
be
as
the
fat
of
they
shall
into
smoke
shal
l
they
consume
Psa37:21
The
wicked
borroweth,
and
payeth
not
but
the
righteous
sheweth
and
Psa37:22
For
such
as
be
blessed
of
him
shall
inherit
the
and
they
that
be
cursed
of
him
shall
be
cut
Psa37:23
The
steps
of
a
good
man
are
ordered
by
the
and
he
delighteth
in
his
Psa37:24
Though
he
he
shall
not
be
utterly
cast
for
the
LORD
upholdeth
him
with
his
Psa37:25
I
have
been
and
now
am
yet
have
I
not
seen
the
righteous
nor
his
seed
begging
Psa37:26
He
is
ever
and
lendeth;
and
his
seed
is
Psa37:27
Depart
from
and
do
and
dwell
for
Psa37:28
For
the
LORD
loveth
and
forsaketh
not
his
they
are
preserved
for
but
the
seed
of
the
wicked
shall
be
cut
Psa37:29
The
righteous
shall
inherit
the
and
dwell
therein
for
Psa37:30
The
mouth
of
the
righteous
speaketh
and
his
tongue
talketh
of
Psa37:31
The
law
of
his
God
is
in
his
none
of
his
steps
shall
Psa37:32
The
wicked
watcheth
the
and
seeketh
to
slay
Psa37:33
The
LORD
will
not
leave
him
in
his
nor
condemn
him
when
he
is
Psa37:34
Wait
on
the
and
keep
his
and
he
shall
exalt
thee
to
inherit
the
when
the
wicked
are
cut
thou
shalt
s
ee
Psa37:35
I
have
seen
the
wicked
in
great
and
spreading
himself
like
a
green
bay
Psa37:36
Yet
he
passed
he
was
I
sought
but
he
could
not
be
Psa37:37
Mark
the
perfect
and
behold
the
for
the
end
of
that
man
is
Psa37:38
But
the
transgressors
shall
be
destroyed
the
end
of
the
wicked
shall
be
cut
Psa37:39
But
the
salvation
of
the
righteous
is
of
the
he
is
their
strength
in
the
time
of
Psa37:40
And
the
LORD
shall
help
and
deliver
he
shall
deliver
them
from
the
and
save
because
they
trust
i
n
Psa38:1
O
rebuke
me
not
in
thy
neither
chasten
me
in
thy
hot
Psa38:2
For
thine
arrows
stick
fast
in
and
thy
hand
presseth
me
Psa38:3
There
is
no
soundness
in
my
flesh
because
of
thine
neither
is
there
any
rest
in
my
bones
because
of
my
Psa38:4
For
mine
iniquities
are
gone
over
mine
as
an
heavy
burden
they
are
too
heavy
for
Psa38:5
My
wounds
stink
and
are
corrupt
because
of
my
Psa38:6
I
am
I
am
bowed
down
I
go
mourning
all
the
day
Psa38:7
For
my
loins
are
filled
with
a
loathsome
and
there
is
no
soundness
in
my
Psa38:8
I
am
feeble
and
sore
I
have
roared
by
reason
of
the
disquietness
of
my
Psa38:9
all
my
desire
is
before
and
my
groaning
is
not
hid
from
Psa38:10
My
heart
panteth,
my
strength
faileth
as
for
the
light
of
mine
it
also
is
gone
from
Psa38:11
My
lovers
and
my
friends
stand
aloof
from
my
and
my
kinsmen
stand
afar
Psa38:12
They
also
that
seek
after
my
life
lay
snares
for
and
they
that
seek
my
hurt
speak
mischievous
and
imagine
dece
its
all
the
day
Psa38:13
But
as
a
deaf
heard
and
I
was
as
a
dumb
man
that
openeth
not
his
Psa38:14
Thus
I
was
as
a
man
that
heareth
and
in
whose
mouth
are
no
reproofs.
Psa38:15
For
in
O
do
I
thou
wilt
O
Lord
my
Psa38:16
For
I
Hear
lest
otherwise
they
should
rejoice
over
when
my
foot
slippeth,
they
magnify
themselves
against
me
.
Psa38:17
For
I
am
ready
to
and
my
sorrow
is
continually
before
Psa38:18
For
I
will
declare
mine
I
will
be
sorry
for
my
Psa38:19
But
mine
enemies
are
and
they
are
and
they
that
hate
me
wrongfully
are
Psa38:20
They
also
that
render
evil
for
good
are
mine
because
I
follow
the
thing
that
good
Psa38:21
Forsake
me
O
O
my
be
not
far
from
Psa38:22
Make
haste
to
help
O
Lord
my
Psa39:1
I
I
will
take
heed
to
my
that
I
sin
not
with
my
I
will
keep
my
mouth
with
a
while
the
wicked
is
before
Psa39:2
I
was
dumb
with
I
held
my
even
from
and
my
sorrow
was
Psa39:3
My
heart
was
hot
within
while
I
was
musing
the
fire
then
spake
I
with
my
Psa39:4
make
me
to
know
mine
and
the
measure
of
my
what
it
that
I
may
know
how
frail
I
Psa39:5
thou
hast
made
my
days
as
an
and
mine
age
is
as
nothing
before
verily
every
man
at
his
best
stat
e
is
altogether
Psa39:6
Surely
every
man
walketh
in
a
vain
surely
they
are
disquieted
in
he
heapeth
up
and
knoweth
not
who
shal
l
gather
Psa39:7
And
what
wait
I
my
hope
is
in
Psa39:8
Deliver
me
from
all
my
make
me
not
the
reproach
of
the
Psa39:9
I
was
I
opened
not
my
because
thou
didst
Psa39:10
Remove
thy
stroke
away
from
I
am
consumed
by
the
blow
of
thine
Psa39:11
When
thou
with
rebukes
dost
correct
man
for
thou
makest
his
beauty
to
consume
away
like
a
surely
every
man
is
Psa39:12
Hear
my
O
and
give
ear
unto
my
hold
not
thy
peace
at
my
for
I
am
a
stranger
with
and
a
soj
ourner,
as
all
my
fathers
Psa39:13
O
spare
that
I
may
recover
before
I
go
and
be
no
Psa40:1
I
waited
patiently
for
the
and
he
inclined
unto
and
heard
my
Psa40:2
He
brought
me
up
also
out
of
an
horrible
out
of
the
miry
and
set
my
feet
upon
a
and
established
my
Psa40:3
And
he
hath
put
a
new
song
in
my
even
praise
unto
our
many
shall
see
and
and
shall
trust
in
the
Psa40:4
Blessed
is
that
man
that
maketh
the
LORD
his
and
respecteth
not
the
nor
such
as
turn
aside
to
Psa40:5
O
LORD
my
are
thy
wonderful
works
which
thou
hast
and
thy
thoughts
which
are
to
us-ward:
they
cannot
be
re
ckoned
up
in
order
unto
if
I
would
declare
and
speak
of
they
are
more
than
can
be
Psa40:6
Sacrifice
and
offering
thou
didst
not
mine
ears
hast
thou
burnt
offering
and
sin
offering
hast
thou
not
req
uired.
Psa40:7
Then
said
I
in
the
volume
of
the
book
it
is
written
of
Psa40:8
I
delight
to
do
thy
O
my
thy
law
is
within
my
Psa40:9
I
have
preached
righteousness
in
the
great
I
have
not
refrained
my
O
thou
knowest.
Psa40:10
I
have
not
hid
thy
righteousness
within
my
I
have
declared
thy
faithfulness
and
thy
I
have
not
concealed
thy
lovingkindness
and
thy
truth
from
the
great
Psa40:11
Withhold
not
thou
thy
tender
mercies
from
O
let
thy
lovingkindness
and
thy
truth
continually
preserve
Psa40:12
For
innumerable
evils
have
compassed
me
mine
iniquities
have
taken
hold
upon
so
that
I
am
not
able
to
look
they
are
more
than
the
hairs
of
mine
therefore
my
heart
faileth
Psa40:13
Be
O
to
deliver
O
make
haste
to
help
Psa40:14
Let
them
be
ashamed
and
confounded
together
that
seek
after
my
soul
to
destroy
let
them
be
driven
backward
and
put
to
shame
that
wish
me
Psa40:15
Let
them
be
desolate
for
a
reward
of
their
shame
that
say
unto
Psa40:16
Let
all
those
that
seek
thee
rejoice
and
be
glad
in
let
such
as
love
thy
salvation
say
The
LORD
be
magn
ified.
Psa40:17
But
I
am
poor
and
yet
the
Lord
thinketh
upon
thou
art
my
help
and
my
make
no
O
my
Psa41:1
Blessed
is
he
that
considereth
the
the
LORD
will
deliver
him
in
time
of
Psa41:2
The
LORD
will
preserve
and
keep
him
and
he
shall
be
blessed
upon
the
and
thou
wilt
not
deliver
him
unto
the
will
of
his
Psa41:3
The
LORD
will
strengthen
him
upon
the
bed
of
thou
wilt
make
all
his
bed
in
his
Psa41:4
I
be
merciful
unto
heal
my
for
I
have
sinned
against
Psa41:5
Mine
enemies
speak
evil
of
When
shall
he
and
his
name
Psa41:6
And
if
he
come
to
see
he
speaketh
his
heart
gathereth
iniquity
to
when
he
goeth
he
telleth
Psa41:7
All
that
hate
me
whisper
together
against
against
me
do
they
devise
my
Psa41:8
An
evil
say
cleaveth
fast
unto
and
now
that
he
lieth
he
shall
rise
up
no
Psa41:9
mine
own
familiar
in
whom
I
which
did
eat
of
my
hath
lifted
up
his
heel
against
Psa41:10
But
O
be
merciful
unto
and
raise
me
that
I
may
requite
Psa41:11
By
this
I
know
that
thou
favourest
because
mine
enemy
doth
not
triumph
over
Psa41:12
And
as
for
thou
upholdest
me
in
mine
and
settest
me
before
thy
face
for
Psa41:13
Blessed
be
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
from
and
to
and
Psa42:1
As
the
hart
panteth
after
the
water
so
panteth
my
soul
after
O
Psa42:2
My
soul
thirsteth
for
for
the
living
when
shall
I
come
and
appear
before
Psa42:3
My
tears
have
been
my
meat
day
and
while
they
continually
say
unto
Where
is
thy
Psa42:4
When
I
remember
these
I
pour
out
my
soul
in
for
I
had
gone
with
the
I
went
with
them
to
the
house
of
with
the
voice
of
joy
and
with
a
multitude
that
kept
holyday.
Psa42:5
Why
art
thou
cast
O
my
and
why
art
thou
disquieted
in
hope
thou
in
for
I
shall
yet
praise
him
for
the
help
of
his
Psa42:6
O
my
my
soul
is
cast
down
within
therefore
will
I
remember
thee
from
the
land
of
and
of
the
Hermonites,
fr
om
the
hill
Psa42:7
Deep
calleth
unto
deep
at
the
noise
of
thy
waterspouts:
all
thy
waves
and
thy
billows
are
gone
over
Psa42:8
Yet
the
LORD
will
command
his
lovingkindness
in
the
day
and
in
the
night
his
song
shall
be
with
and
my
prayer
unt
o
the
God
of
my
Psa42:9
I
will
say
unto
God
my
Why
hast
thou
forgotten
why
go
I
mourning
because
of
the
oppression
of
the
Psa42:10
As
with
a
sword
in
my
mine
enemies
reproach
while
they
say
daily
unto
Where
is
thy
Psa42:11
Why
art
thou
cast
O
my
and
why
art
thou
disquieted
within
hope
thou
in
for
I
shall
yet
praise
wh
o
is
the
health
of
my
and
my
Psa43:1
Judge
O
and
plead
my
cause
against
an
ungodly
O
deliver
me
from
the
deceitful
and
unjust
Psa43:2
For
thou
art
the
God
of
my
why
dost
thou
cast
me
why
go
I
mourning
because
of
the
oppression
of
the
Psa43:3
O
send
out
thy
light
and
thy
let
them
lead
let
them
bring
me
unto
thy
holy
and
to
thy
Psa43:4
Then
will
I
go
unto
the
altar
of
unto
God
my
exceeding
upon
the
harp
will
I
praise
O
God
my
Psa43:5
Why
art
thou
cast
O
my
and
why
art
thou
disquieted
within
hope
in
for
I
shall
yet
praise
who
is
t
he
health
of
my
and
my
Psa44:1
We
have
heard
with
our
O
our
fathers
have
told
what
work
thou
didst
in
their
in
the
times
of
Psa44:2
How
thou
didst
drive
out
the
heathen
with
thy
and
plantedst
how
thou
didst
afflict
the
and
cast
them
ou
t.
Psa44:3
For
they
got
not
the
land
in
possession
by
their
own
neither
did
their
own
arm
save
but
thy
right
and
th
ine
and
the
light
of
thy
because
thou
hadst
a
favour
unto
Psa44:4
Thou
art
my
O
command
deliverances
for
Psa44:5
Through
thee
will
we
push
down
our
through
thy
name
will
we
tread
them
under
that
rise
up
against
Psa44:6
For
I
will
not
trust
in
my
neither
shall
my
sword
save
Psa44:7
But
thou
hast
saved
us
from
our
and
hast
put
them
to
shame
that
hated
Psa44:8
In
God
we
boast
all
the
day
and
praise
thy
name
for
Psa44:9
But
thou
hast
cast
and
put
us
to
and
goest
not
forth
with
our
Psa44:10
Thou
makest
us
to
turn
back
from
the
and
they
which
hate
us
spoil
for
Psa44:11
Thou
hast
given
us
like
sheep
appointed
for
and
hast
scattered
us
among
the
Psa44:12
Thou
sellest
thy

dost
not
increase
thy

Psa44:13
Thou
makest
us
a
reproach
to
our
a
scorn
and
a
derision
to
them
that

Thou
makest

among

My
confusion
is
continually
before

the
shame
of
my
face
hath
covered
Psa44:16
For
the

of
him
that
reproacheth

blasphemeth;
by
reason
of
the
enemy

All
this
is
come
upon

Our

Though
thou
hast
sore
broken
us
in
the

covered
us
with
the
shadow
of
Psa44:20
If
we
have
forgotten
the
name
of
our

stretched
out
our

Shall
not
God

why
sleepest
O
cast
us
not
off

Psa44:24
Wherefore
hidest
thou
thy

forgettest
our
affliction
and

For

Arise

Wherefore

They

not
reprove
thee
for
thy

thy
burnt

before
Psa50:9
I
will
take
no
bullock
out
of
thy

out

For
every

Psa50:11
I
know

Will

Offer
unto
God
and
pay
thy
vows
unto
the
most
Psa50:15
And
call
upon
me
in
the
day
of
I
will
deliver
and
thou
shalt
glorify
Psa50:16
But
unto
the
wicked
God
What
hast
thou
to
do
to
declare
my
or
that
thou
shouldest
take
my
covenant
in
thy
Psa50:17
Seeing
thou
hatest
and
casteth
my
words
behind
Psa50:18
When
thou
sawest
a
then
thou
consentedst
with
and
hast
been
partaker
with
Psa50:19
Thou
givest
thy
mouth
to

thy
tongue
frameth
Psa50:20
Thou
sittest
and
speakest
against
thy

slanderest
thine
own
mother's
Psa50:21
These
things
hast
thou
and
I
kept
thou
thoughtest
that
I
was
altogether
such
an
one
as
but
I
will
reprove
and
set
them
in
order
before
thine
Psa50:22
Now
consider
ye
that
forget
lest
I
tear
you
in

be
none

Whoso
offereth
praise
glorifieth

to
him

ordereth
his
conversation
aright

I
shew
the
salvation
of

Have
mercy
upon

according
to
thy
lovingkindness:
according
unto
the
multitude
of
thy
tender
mercies
blot
out
my
Psa51:2
Wash
me
throughly
from
mine

cleanse
me
from
my

For
I
acknowledge
my

my
sin
is
ever

Psa51:4
Against
thee
have
I

done
this
evil
in
thy

thou
mightest
be
justified
when

speakest

and
be
clear
when

judgest.
Psa51:5
I
was
shapen
in

in
sin
did
my
mother
conceive
Psa51:6

desirest
truth
in
the
inward

in
the
hidden
part

make
me

Purge
me
with

shall
be
whiter

Make
me
to
hear

that
the
bones
which
thou
hast
broken
may

Hide
thy
face
from
my

blot
out
all
mine
Psa51:10
Create
in
me
a

renew

Cast

Restore
unto
me
the
joy
of
thy

uphold
me

Then
will

teach
transgressors

sinners

be
converted
unto

Deliver
me
from

thou
God
of
my

sing
aloud
of
thy

O
open

my

shew
forth
thy

For

The

Do
good

Then

Why
boastest

mischiefs;
like

But

I
will
abide
in
thy
tabernacle
for

For
O

given
me
the
heritage
of

Add
iniquity

wickedly
concerning
they
speak
Psa73:9
They
set
their
mouth
against
the
and
their
tongue
walketh
through
the
Psa73:10
Therefore
his
people
return
and
waters
of
a
full
cup
are
wrung
out
to
Psa73:11
And
they
How
doth
God
and
is
there
knowledge
in
the
most
Psa73:12
these
are
the
who
prosper
in
the
they
increase
in
Psa73:13
Verily
I
have
cleansed
my
heart
in
and
washed
my
hands
in
Psa73:14
For
all
the
day
long
have
I
been
and
chastened
every
Psa73:15
If
I
I
will
speak
I
should
offend
against
the
generation
of
thy
Psa73:16
When
I
thought
to
know
it
was
too
painful
for
Psa73:17
Until
I
went
into
the
sanctuary
of
then
understood
I
their
Psa73:18
Surely
thou
didst
set
them
in
slippery
thou
castedst
them
down
into
Psa73:19
How
are
they
brought
into
as
in
a
they
are
utterly
consumed
with
Psa73:20
As
a
dream
when
one
awaketh;
O
when
thou
awakest,
thou
shalt
despise
their
Psa73:21
Thus
my
heart
was
and
I
was
pricked
in
my
Psa73:22
So
foolish
was
and
I
was
as
a
beast
before
Psa73:23
Nevertheless
I
am
continually
with
thou
hast
holden
me
by
my
right
Psa73:24
Thou
shalt
guide
me
with
thy
and
afterward
receive
me
to
Psa73:25
Whom
have
I
in
heaven
but
and
there
is
none
upon
earth
that
I
desire
beside
Psa73:26
My
flesh
and
my
heart
faileth:
but
God
is
the
strength
of
my
and
my
portion
for
Psa73:27
they
that
are
far
from
thee
shall
thou
hast
destroyed
all
them
that
go
a
whoring
from
Psa73:28
But
it
is
good
for
me
to
draw
near
to
I
have
put
my
trust
in
the
Lord
that
I
may
declare
all
thy
Psa74:1
O
why
hast
thou
cast
us
off
for
why
doth
thine
anger
smoke
against
the
sheep
of
thy
Psa74:2
Remember
thy
which
thou
hast
purchased
of
the
rod
of
thine
which
thou
hast

Lift
up
thy
feet
unto
the
perpetual

Thine
enemies

set
up
their
ensigns
for

A
man
was
famous
according
as
he
had
lifted
up
axes
upon
the
thick
Psa74:6
But
now
they
break
down
the
carved
work
thereof
at
once
with
axes
and
Psa74:7
They
have
cast
fire
into
thy

have
defiled
by
casting
down
the
dwelling
place
of
thy
name
to
the

They
said
in

O
how

the
adversary

Why
withdrawest
thou

it
out
of

Psa74:12
For
God
is
my
King
of
working
salvation
in

Thou
didst
divide

Thou
brakest
the

leviathan

gavest
him
to

the
people
inhabiting

that

All

Thou

cause
judgment
to

When

arose
to
to

all
the

Surely
the

He
shall

off

terrible
to
the
kings
of

Psa77:1
I
cried
unto
God
with
my
even
unto
God
with
my
and
he
gave
ear
unto
Psa77:2
In
the
day
of
my
trouble
I
sought
the
my
sore
ran
in
the
and
ceased
my
soul
refused
to
be
Psa77:3
I
remembered
and
was
I
and
my
spirit
was
Psa77:4
Thou
holdest
mine
eyes
I
am
so
troubled
that
I
cannot
Psa77:5
I
have
considered
the
days
of
the
years
of
ancient
Psa77:6
I
call
to
remembrance
my
song
in
the
I
commune
with
mine
own
and
my
spirit
made
diligent
Psa77:7
Will
the
Lord
cast
off
for
and
will
he
be
favourable
no
Psa77:8
Is
his
mercy
clean
gone
for
doth
his
promise
fail
for
Psa77:9
Hath
God
forgotten
to
be
hath
he
in
anger
shut
up
his
tender
Psa77:10
And
I
This
is
my
but
I
will
remember
the
years
of
the
right
hand
of
the
most
Psa77:11
I
will
remember
the
works
of
the
surely
I
will
remember
thy
wonders
of
Psa77:12
I
will
meditate
also
of
all
thy
and
talk
of
thy
Psa77:13
Thy
O
is
in
the
who
is
so
great
a
God
as
our
Psa77:14
Thou
art
the
God
that
doest
thou
hast
declared
thy
strength
among
the
Psa77:15
Thou
hast
with
thine
arm
redeemed
thy
the
sons
of
Jacob
and
Psa77:16
The
waters
saw
O
the
waters
saw
they
were
the
depths
also
were
Psa77:17
The
clouds
poured
out
the
skies
sent
out
a
thine
arrows
also
went
Psa77:18
The
voice
of
thy
thunder
was
in
the
the
lightnings
lightened
the
the
earth
trembled
and
Psa77:19
Thy
way
is
in
the
and
thy
path
in
the
great
and
thy
footsteps
are
not
Psa77:20
Thou
leddest
thy
people
like
a
flock
by
the
hand
of
Moses
and
Psa78:1
Give
O
my
to
my
incline
your
ears
to
the
words
of
my
Psa78:2
I
will
open
my
mouth
in
a
I
will
utter
dark
sayings
of
Psa78:3
Which
we
have
heard
and
and
our
fathers
have
told
Psa78:4
We
will
not
hide
them
from
their
shewing
to
the
generation
to
come
the
praises
of
the
and
his
and
his
wonderful
works
that
he
hath
Psa78:5
For
he
established
a
testimony
in
and
appointed
a
law
in
which
he
commanded
our
that
they
should
ma
ke
them
known
to
their
Psa78:6
That
the
generation
to
come
might
know
even
the
children
which
should
be
who
should
arise
and
declare
them
to
t
heir
Psa78:7
That
they
might
set
their
hope
in
and
not
forget
the
works
of
but
keep
his
Psa78:8
And
might
not
be
as
their
a
stubborn
and
rebellious
a
generation
that
set
not
their
heart
and
whose
spirit
was
not
stedfast
with
Psa78:9
The
children
of
being
and
carrying
turned
back
in
the
day
of
Psa78:10
They
kept
not
the
covenant
of
and
refused
to
walk
in
his
Psa78:11
And
forgat
his
and
his
wonders
that
he
had
shewed
Psa78:12
Marvellous
things
did
he
in
the
sight
of
their
in
the
land
of
in
the
field
of
Psa78:13
He
divided
the
and
caused
them
to
pass
and
he
made
the
waters
to
stand
as
an
Psa78:14
In
the
daytime
also
he
led
them
with
a
and
all
the
night
with
a
light
of
Psa78:15
He
clave
the
rocks
in
the
and
gave
them
drink
as
out
of
the
great
Psa78:16
He
brought
streams
also
out
of
the
and
caused
waters
to
run
down
like
Psa78:17
And
they
sinned
yet
more
against
him
by
provoking
the
most
High
in
the
Psa78:18
And
they
tempted
God
in
their
heart
by
asking
meat
for
their
Psa78:19
they
spake
against
they
Can
God
furnish
a
table
in
the
Psa78:20
he
smote
the
that
the
waters
gushed
and
the
streams
can
he
give
bread
can
he
provide
flesh
for
his
Psa78:21
Therefore
the
LORD
heard
and
was
so
a
fire
was
kindled
against
and
anger
also
came
up
against
Psa78:22
Because
they
believed
not
in
and
trusted
not
in
his
Psa78:23
Though
he
had
commanded
the
clouds
from
and
opened
the
doors
of
Psa78:24
And
had
rained
down
manna
upon
them
to
and
had
given
them
of
the
corn
of
Psa78:25
Man
did
eat
he
sent
them
meat
to
the
Psa78:26
He
caused
an
east
wind
to
blow
in
the
and
by
his
power
he
brought
in
the
south
Psa78:27
He
rained
flesh
also
upon
them
as
and
feathered
fowls
like
as
the
sand
of
the
Psa78:28
And
he
let
it
fall
in
the
midst
of
their
round
about
their
Psa78:29
So
they
did
and
were
well
for
he
gave
them
their
own
Psa78:30
They
were
not
estranged
from
their
But
while
their
meat
was
yet
in
their
Psa78:31
The
wrath
of
God
came
upon
and
slew
the
fattest
of
and
smote
down
the
chosen
men
of
Psa78:32
For
all
this
they
sinned
and
believed
not
for
his
wondrous
Psa78:33
Therefore
their
days
did
he
consume
in
and
their
years
in
Psa78:34
When
he
slew
then
they
sought
and
they
returned
and
enquired
early
after
Psa78:35
And
they
remembered
that
God
was
their
and
the
high
God
their
Psa78:36
Nevertheless
they
did
flatter
him
with
their
and
they
lied
unto
him
with
their
Psa78:37
For
their
heart
was
not
right
with
neither
were
they
stedfast
in
his
Psa78:38
But
being
full
of
forgave
their
and
destroyed
them
many
a
time
turned
he
his
anger
awa
y,
and
did
not
stir
up
all
his
Psa78:39
For
he
remembered
that
they
were
but
a
wind
that
passeth
and
cometh
not
Psa78:40
How
oft
did
they
provoke
him
in
the
and
grieve
him
in
the
Psa78:41
they
turned
back
and
tempted
and
limited
the
Holy
One
of
Psa78:42
They
remembered
not
his
nor
the
day
when
he
delivered
them
from
the
Psa78:43
How
he
had
wrought
his
signs
in
and
his
wonders
in
the
field
of
Psa78:44
And
had
turned
their
rivers
into
and
their
that
they
could
not
Psa78:45
He
sent
divers
sorts
of
flies
among
which
devoured
and
which
destroyed
Psa78:46
He
gave
also
their
increase
unto
the
caterpiller,
and
their
labour
unto
the
Psa78:47
He
destroyed
their
vines
with
and
their
sycomore
trees
with
Psa78:48
He
gave
up
their
cattle
also
to
the
and
their
flocks
to
hot
Psa78:49
He
cast
upon
them
the
fierceness
of
his
and
and
by
sending
evil
angels
among
Psa78:50
He
made
a
way
to
his
he
spared
not
their
soul
from
but
gave
their
life
over
to
the
Psa78:51
And
smote
all
the
firstborn
in
the
chief
of
their
strength
in
the
tabernacles
of
Psa78:52
But
made
his
own
people
to
go
forth
like
and
guided
them
in
the
wilderness
like
a
Psa78:53
And
he
led
them
on
so
that
they
feared
but
the
sea
overwhelmed
their
Psa78:54
And
he
brought
them
to
the
border
of
his
even
to
this
which
his
right
hand
had
Psa78:55
He
cast
out
the
heathen
also
before
and
divided
them
an
inheritance
by
and
made
the
tribes
of
Israel
to
dwell
in
their
Psa78:56
Yet
they
tempted
and
provoked
the
most
high
and
kept
not
his
Psa78:57
But
turned
and
dealt
unfaithfully
like
their
they
were
turned
aside
like
a
deceitful
Psa78:58
For
they
provoked
him
to
anger
with
their
high
and
moved
him
to
jealousy
with
their
graven
Psa78:59
When
God
heard
he
was
and
greatly
abhorred
Psa78:60
So
that
he
forsook
the
tabernacle
of
the
tent
which
he
placed
among
Psa78:61
And
delivered
his
strength
into
and
his
glory
into
the
enemy's
Psa78:62
He
gave
his
people
over
also
unto
the
and
was
wroth
with
his
Psa78:63
The
fire
consumed
their
young
and
their
maidens
were
not
given
to
Psa78:64
Their
priests
fell
by
the
and
their
widows
made
no
Psa78:65
Then
the
LORD
awaked
as
one
out
of
and
like
a
mighty
man
that
shouteth
by
reason
of
Psa78:66
And
he
smote
his
enemies
in
the
hinder
he
put
them
to
a
perpetual
Psa78:67
Moreover
he
refused
the
tabernacle
of
and
chose
not
the
tribe
of
Psa78:68
But
chose
the
tribe
of
the
mount
Zion
which
he
Psa78:69
And
he
built
his
sanctuary
like
high
like
the
earth
which
he
hath
established
for
Psa78:70
He
chose
David
also
his
and
took
him
from
the
sheepfolds:
Psa78:71
From
following
the
ewes
great
with
young
he
brought
him
to
feed
Jacob
his
and
Israel
his
Psa78:72
So
he

O
the

laid
Jerusalem
on

The

Their

We
are
become
a
reproach
to
our

How

Pour

wrath
upon
the
heathen
that

Wherefore

Where

So

O
LORD
God
of

thou
be
angry

thy
Psa80:5
Thou
feedest
them
with
the

Thou
makest

Turn

Thou

Thou
preparedst

The

She

The

And

Blow

feast
Psa81:4
For
this
was
a
statute
for
and
a
law
of
the
God
of
Psa81:5
This
he
ordained
in
Joseph
for
a
when
he
went
out
through
the
land
of
where
I
heard
a
language
that
I
und
erstood
Psa81:6
I
removed
his
shoulder
from
the
his
hands
were
delivered
from
the
Psa81:7
Thou
calledst
in
and
I
delivered
I
answered
thee
in
the
secret
place
of
I
proved
thee
at
the
waters
of
Meribah.
Psa81:8
O
my
and
I
will
testify
unto
O
if
thou
wilt
hearken
unto
Psa81:9
There
shall
no
strange
god
be
in
neither
shalt
thou
worship
any
strange
Psa81:10
I
am
the
LORD
thy
which
brought
thee
out
of
the
land
of
open
thy
mouth
and
I
will
fill
Psa81:11
But
my
people
would
not
hearken
to
my
and
Israel
would
none
of
Psa81:12
So
I
gave
them
up
unto
their
own
and
they
walked
in
their
own
Psa81:13
Oh
that
my
people
had
hearkened
unto
and
Israel
had
walked
in
my
Psa81:14
I
should
soon
have
subdued
their
and
turned
my
hand
against
their
Psa81:15
The
haters
of
the
LORD
should
have
submitted
themselves
unto
but
their
time
should
have
endured
for
Psa81:16
He
should
have
fed
them
also
with
the
finest
of
the
and
with
honey
out
of
the
rock
should
I
have
satisfied
Psa82:1
God
standeth
in
the
congregation
of
the

judgeth
among

How
long
will
ye
judge

accept
the
persons
of

Defend
the

and
do
justice
to
the
afflicted
and
Psa82:4
Deliver
the

rid
them
out
of

They

Ye

But
ye

They
have
taken
crafty
counsel
against
thy

consulted
against
thy
hidden
Psa83:4
They
have
and
let
us
cut
them
off
from
being
a
that
the
name
of
Israel
may
be
no
more
in
Psa83:5
For
they
have
consulted
together
with
one
they
are
confederate
against
Psa83:6
The
tabernacles
of
and
the
Ishmaelites;
of
and
the
Hagarenes;
Psa83:7
Gebal,
and
and
Amalek;
the
Philistines
with
the
inhabitants
of

Assur
also
is
joined
with

holpen
the
children
of
Psa83:9
Do
unto
them
as
unto
the
Midianites;
as
to
as
to
Jabin,
at
the
brook
of
Kison:
Psa83:10
Which
perished
at
Endor:
they
became
as
dung
for

Make
their
nobles
like
Oreb,

like
Zeeb:
all
their
princes
as
Zebah,

Zalmunna:
Psa83:12
Who
Let
us
take
to
ourselves
the
houses
of
God
in
Psa83:13
O
my
make
them
like
a
as
the
stubble
before

Psa83:14
As
the
fire
burneth
a

as
the
flame
setteth
the
mountains
on

So
persecute
them
with
thy
and
make
them
afraid
with
thy
Psa83:16
Fill
their
faces
with
that
they
may
seek
thy
O
Psa83:17
Let
them
be
confounded
and
troubled
for
let
them
be
put

That
men
may
know
that
whose
name
alone
is

the
most

How
amiable

Wilt

In

But

Glorious
things

The
LORD
shall

writeth
up

As
well

O
LORD
God
of

cried
day

Let
my
prayer
come

incline
thine

For

draweth
nigh
unto

I
am
counted
with
them
that

a

Free
among

thou
rememberest
no

off
from

Psa88:6
Thou
hast
laid
me
in
the
lowest
in
in
the
Psa88:7
Thy
wrath
lieth
hard
upon
and
thou
hast
afflicted
me
with
all
thy

Thou
hast
put
away
mine
acquaintance
far
from

hast
made
me
an
abomination
unto

am
shut
and
I
cannot
co
me
Psa88:9
Mine
eye
mourneth
by
reason
of
I
have
called
daily
upon
I
have
stretched
out
my
hands
unto
Psa88:10
Wilt
thou
shew
wonders
to
the

the
dead
arise
and
praise
Psa88:11
Shall
thy
lovingkindness
be
declared

Shall
thy
wonders
be
known
in
the

thy
righteousness
in
the
land
of

But
unto
thee

I
O
and
in
the
morning
shall
my
prayer
prevent
Psa88:14
why
castest
thou
off
my
why
hidest
thou
thy
face
from

I
am
afflicted
and
ready
to
die
from
my
youth
while

suffer
thy
terrors

Thy
fierce
wrath

over
thy
terrors

cut
me
Psa88:17
They
came
round
about
me
daily
like
they
compassed
me
about

Lover
and
friend

put

from

mine
acquaintance
into

I
will
sing
of
the
mercies
of

I
make
known
thy
faithfulness

For

the
heavens
shall
praise
thy

thy
faithfulness
also
in
the
congregation
of

For
who

heaven
can
be
compared
unto
the
who
among
the
sons

mighty

be
likened
unto

Thou

Tabor
and
Hermon
shall
rejoice
in
thy
Psa89:13
Thou
hast
a
mighty
strong
is
thy
and
high
is
thy
right
Psa89:14
Justice
and
judgment
are
the
habitation
of
thy
mercy
and
truth
shall
go
before
thy
Psa89:15
Blessed
is
the
people
that
know
the
joyful
they
shall
O
in
the
light
of
thy
Psa89:16
In
thy
name
shall
they
rejoice
all
the
and
in
thy
righteousness
shall
they
be
Psa89:17
For
thou
art
the
glory
of
their
and
in
thy
favour
our
horn
shall
be
Psa89:18
For
the
LORD
is
our
and
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
is
our
Psa89:19
Then
thou
spakest
in
vision
to
thy
holy
and
saidst,
I
have
laid
help
upon
one
that
is
I
have
exalted
one
chos
en
out
of
the
Psa89:20
I
have
found
David
my
with
my
holy
oil
have
I
anointed
Psa89:21
With
whom
my
hand
shall
be
mine
arm
also
shall
strengthen
Psa89:22
The
enemy
shall
not
exact
upon
nor
the
son
of
wickedness
afflict
Psa89:23
And
I
will
beat
down
his
foes
before
his
and
plague
them
that
hate
Psa89:24
But
my
faithfulness
and
my
mercy
shall
be
with
and
in
my
name
shall
his
horn
be
Psa89:25
I
will
set
his
hand
also
in
the
and
his
right
hand
in
the
Psa89:26
He
shall
cry
unto
Thou
art
my
my
and
the
rock
of
my
Psa89:27
Also
I
will
make
him
my
higher
than
the
kings
of
the
Psa89:28
My
mercy
will
I
keep
for
him
for
and
my
covenant
shall
stand
fast
with
Psa89:29
His
seed
also
will
I
make
to
endure
for
and
his
throne
as
the
days
of
Psa89:30
If
his
children
forsake
my
and
walk
not
in
my
Psa89:31
If
they
break
my
and
keep
not
my
Psa89:32
Then
will
I
visit
their
transgression
with
the
and
their
iniquity
with
Psa89:33
Nevertheless
my
lovingkindness
will
I
not
utterly
take
from
nor
suffer
my
faithfulness
to
Psa89:34
My
covenant
will
I
not
nor
alter
the
thing
that
is
gone
out
of
my
Psa89:35
Once
have
I
sworn
by
my
holiness
that
I
will
not
lie
unto
Psa89:36
His
seed
shall
endure
for
and
his
throne
as
the
sun
before
Psa89:37
It
shall
be
established
for
ever
as
the
and
as
a
faithful
witness
in
Psa89:38
But
thou
hast
cast
off
and
thou
hast
been
wroth
with
thine
Psa89:39
Thou
hast
made
void
the
covenant
of
thy
thou
hast
profaned
his
crown
by
casting
it
to
the
Psa89:40
Thou
hast
broken
down
all
his
thou
hast
brought
his
strong
holds
to
Psa89:41
All
that
pass
by
the
way
spoil
he
is
a
reproach
to
his
Psa89:42
Thou
hast
set
up
the
right
hand
of
his
thou
hast
made
all
his
enemies
to
Psa89:43
Thou
hast
also
turned
the
edge
of
his
and
hast
not
made
him
to
stand
in
the
Psa89:44
Thou
hast
made
his
glory
to
and
cast
his
throne
down
to
the
Psa89:45
The
days
of
his
youth
hast
thou
thou
hast
covered
him
with
Psa89:46
How
wilt
thou
hide
thyself
for
shall
thy
wrath
burn
like
Psa89:47
Remember
how
short
my
time
wherefore
hast
thou
made
all
men
in
Psa89:48
What
man
is
he
that
and
shall
not
see
shall
he
deliver
his
soul
from
the
hand
of
the
Psa89:49
where
are
thy
former
lovingkindnesses,
which
thou
swarest
unto
David
in
thy
Psa89:50
the
reproach
of
thy
how
I
do
bear
in
my
bosom
the
reproach
of
all
the
mighty
Psa89:51
Wherewith
thine
enemies
have
O
wherewith
they
have
reproached
the
footsteps
of
thine
Psa89:52
Blessed
be
the
LORD
for
and
Psa90:1
thou
hast
been
our
dwelling
place
in
all
Psa90:2
Before
the
mountains
were
brought
or
ever
thou
hadst
formed
the
earth
and
the
even
from
everlasting
to
everla
thou
art
Psa90:3
Thou
turnest
man
to
and
sayest,
ye
children
of
Psa90:4
For
a
thousand
years
in
thy
sight
are
but
as
yesterday
when
it
is
and
as
a
watch
in
the
Psa90:5
Thou
carriest
them
away
as
with
a
they
are
as
a
in
the
morning
they
are
like
grass
which
groweth
Psa90:6
In
the
morning
it
flourisheth,
and
groweth
in
the
evening
it
is
cut
and
withereth.
Psa90:7
For
we
are
consumed
by
thine
and
by
thy
wrath
are
we
Psa90:8
Thou
hast
set
our
iniquities
before
our
secret
sins
in
the
light
of
thy
Psa90:9
For
all
our
days
are
passed
away
in
thy
we
spend
our
years
as
a
tale
that
is
Psa90:10
The
days
of
our
years
are
threescore
years
and
and
if
by
reason
of
strength
they
be
fourscore
yet
is
their
str
ength
labour
and
for
it
is
soon
cut
and
we
fly
Psa90:11
Who
knoweth
the
power
of
thine
even
according
to
thy
so
is
thy
Psa90:12
So
teach
us
to
number
our
that
we
may
apply
our
hearts
unto
Psa90:13
O
how
and
let
it
repent
thee
concerning
thy
Psa90:14
O
satisfy
us
early
with
thy
that
we
may
rejoice
and
be
glad
all
our
Psa90:15
Make
us
glad
according
to
the
days
wherein
thou
hast
afflicted
and
the
years
wherein
we
have
seen
Psa90:16
Let
thy
work
appear
unto
thy
and
thy
glory
unto
their
Psa90:17
And
let
the
beauty
of
the
LORD
our
God
be
upon
and
establish
thou
the
work
of
our
hands
upon
the
work
of
our
hands
establish

Psa91:1
He
that
dwelleth
in
the
secret
place
of
the
most
High
shall
abide
under
the
shadow
of
the
Psa91:2
I
will
say
of
the
He
is
my
refuge
and
my
my
in
him
will
I
Psa91:3
Surely
he
shall
deliver
thee
from
the
snare
of
the
and
from
the
noisome
Psa91:4
He
shall
cover
thee
with
his
and
under
his
wings
shalt
thou
his
truth
shall
be
thy
shield
and
Psa91:5
Thou
shalt
not
be
afraid
for
the
terror
by
nor
for
the
arrow
that
flieth
by
Psa91:6
Nor
for
the
pestilence
that
walketh
in
nor
for
the
destruction
that
wasteth
at
Psa91:7
A
thousand
shall
fall
at
thy
and
ten
thousand
at
thy
right
but
it
shall
not
come
nigh
Psa91:8
Only
with
thine
eyes
shalt
thou
behold
and
see
the
reward
of
the
Psa91:9
Because
thou
hast
made
the
which
is
my
even
the
most
thy
Psa91:10
There
shall
no
evil
befall
neither
shall
any
plague
come
nigh
thy
Psa91:11
For
he
shall
give
his
angels
charge
over
to
keep
thee
in
all
thy
Psa91:12
They
shall
bear
thee
up
in
their
lest
thou
dash
thy
foot
against
a
Psa91:13
Thou
shalt
tread
upon
the
lion
and
the
young
lion
and
the
dragon
shalt
thou
trample
under
Psa91:14
Because
he
hath
set
his
love
upon
therefore
will
I
deliver
I
will
set
him
on
because
he
hath
known
my
Psa91:15
He
shall
call
upon
and
I
will
answer
I
will
be
with
him
in

will
deliver
and
honour
Psa91:16
With
long
life
will
I
satisfy

shew
him
my
Psa92:1
IT
IS
A
GOOD
THING
TO
GIVE
THANKS
UNTO
THE
AND

SING
PRAISES
UNTO
THY

To
shew

thy

Upon
an

of

For

made
me
glad
through
thy

will
triumph
in
the
works
of
thy
Psa92:5
O
how
great
are
thy
and
thy
thoughts
are
very

A
brutish

a
fool
understand
Psa92:7
When
the
wicked

that

Mine

The

Those

As

that
keep
and
he
that
doeth
righteousness
at
all
Psa106:4
Remember
O
with
the
favour
that
thou
bearest
unto
thy
O
visit
me
with
thy
Psa106:5
That
I
may
see
the
good
of
thy
that
I
may
rejoice
in
the
gladness
of
thy
that
I
may
glory
with
thine
inher
itance.
Psa106:6
We
have
sinned
with
our
we
have
committed
we
have
done
Psa106:7
Our
fathers
understood
not
thy
wonders
in
they
remembered
not
the
multitude
of
thy
but
provoked
him
at
the
even
at
the
Red
Psa106:8
Nevertheless
he
saved
them
for
his
name's
that
he
might
make
his
mighty
power
to
be
Psa106:9
He
rebuked
the
Red
sea
and
it
was
dried
so
he
led
them
through
the
as
through
the
Psa106:10
And
he
saved
them
from
the
hand
of
him
that
hated
and
redeemed
them
from
the
hand
of
the
Psa106:11
And
the
waters
covered
their
there
was
not
one
of
them
Psa106:12
Then
believed
they
his
they
sang
his
Psa106:13
They
soon
forgat
his
they
waited
not
for
his
Psa106:14
But
lusted
exceedingly
in
the
and
tempted
God
in
the
Psa106:15
And
he
gave
them
their
but
sent
leanness
into
their
Psa106:16
They
envied
Moses
also
in
the
and
Aaron
the
saint
of
the
Psa106:17
The
earth
opened
and
swallowed
up
Dathan,
and
covered
the
company
of
Abiram.
Psa106:18
And
a
fire
was
kindled
in
their
the
flame
burned
up
the
Psa106:19
They
made
a
calf
in
and
worshipped
the
molten
Psa106:20
Thus
they
changed
their
glory
into
the
similitude
of
an
ox
that
eateth
Psa106:21
They
forgat
God
their
which
had
done
great
things
in
Psa106:22
Wondrous
works
in
the
land
of
and
terrible
things
by
the
Red
Psa106:23
Therefore
he
said
that
he
would
destroy
had
not
Moses
his
chosen
stood
before
him
in
the
to
turn
away
his
w
rath,
lest
he
should
destroy
Psa106:24
they
despised
the
pleasant
they
believed
not
his
Psa106:25
But
murmured
in
their
and
hearkened
not
unto
the
voice
of
the
Psa106:26
Therefore
he
lifted
up
his
hand
against
to
overthrow
them
in
the
Psa106:27
To
overthrow
their
seed
also
among
the
and
to
scatter
them
in
the
Psa106:28
They
joined
themselves
also
unto
Baalpeor,
and
ate
the
sacrifices
of
the
Psa106:29
Thus
they
provoked
him
to
anger
with
their
and
the
plague
brake
in
upon
Psa106:30
Then
stood
up
Phinehas,
and
executed
and
so
the
plague
was
Psa106:31
And
that
was
counted
unto
him
for
righteousness
unto
all
generations
for
Psa106:32
They
angered
him
also
at
the
waters
of
so
that
it
went
ill
with
Moses
for
their
Psa106:33
Because
they
provoked
his
so
that
he
spake
unadvisedly
with
his
Psa106:34
They
did
not
destroy
the
concerning
whom
the
LORD
commanded
Psa106:35
But
were
mingled
among
the
and
learned
their
Psa106:36
And
they
served
their
which
were
a
snare
unto
Psa106:37
they
sacrificed
their
sons
and
their
daughters
unto
Psa106:38
And
shed
innocent
even
the
blood
of
their
sons
and
of
their
whom
they
sacrificed
unto
the
idols
of
Cana
and
the
land
was
polluted
with
Psa106:39
Thus
were
they
defiled
with
their
own
and
went
a
whoring
with
their
own
Psa106:40
Therefore
was
the
wrath
of
the
LORD
kindled
against
his
insomuch
that
he
abhorred
his
own
Psa106:41
And
he
gave
them
into
the
hand
of
the
and
they
that
hated
them
ruled
over
Psa106:42
Their
enemies
also
oppressed
and
they
were
brought
into
subjection
under
their
Psa106:43
Many
times
did
he
deliver
but
they
provoked
him
with
their
and
were
brought
low
for
their
Psa106:44
Nevertheless
he
regarded
their
when
he
heard
their
Psa106:45
And
he
remembered
for
them
his
and
repented
according
to
the
multitude
of
his
Psa106:46
He
made
them
also
to
be
pitied
of
all
those
that
carried
them
Psa106:47
Save
O
LORD
our
and
gather
us
from
among
the
to
give
thanks
unto
thy
holy
and
to
triumph
in
thy
p
Psa106:48
Blessed
be
the
LORD
God
of
Israel
from
everlasting
to
and
let
all
the
people
Praise
ye
the
Psa107:1
O
give
thanks
unto
the
for
he
is
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
Psa107:2
Let
the
redeemed
of
the
LORD
say
whom
he
hath
redeemed
from
the
hand
of
the
Psa107:3
And
gathered
them
out
of
the
from
the
and
from
the
from
the
and
from
the
Psa107:4
They
wandered
in
the
wilderness
in
a
solitary
they
found
no
city
to
dwell
Psa107:5
Hungry
and
their
soul
fainted
in
Psa107:6
Then
they
cried
unto
the
LORD
in
their
and
he
delivered
them
out
of
their
Psa107:7
And
he
led
them
forth
by
the
right
that
they
might
go
to
a
city
of
Psa107:8
Oh
that
men
would
praise
the
LORD
for
his
and
for
his
wonderful
works
to
the
children
of
Psa107:9
For
he
satisfieth
the
longing
and
filleth
the
hungry
soul
with
Psa107:10
Such
as
sit
in
darkness
and
in
the
shadow
of
being
bound
in
affliction
and
Psa107:11
Because
they
rebelled
against
the
words
of
and
contemned
the
counsel
of
the
most
Psa107:12
Therefore
he
brought
down
their
heart
with
they
fell
and
there
was
none
to
Psa107:13
Then
they
cried
unto
the
LORD
in
their
and
he
saved
them
out
of
their
Psa107:14
He
brought
them
out
of
darkness
and
the
shadow
of
and
brake
their
bands
in
Psa107:15
Oh
that
men
would
praise
the
LORD
for
his
and
for
his
wonderful
works
to
the
children
of
Psa107:16
For
he
hath
broken
the
gates
of
and
cut
the
bars
of
iron
in
Psa107:17
Fools
because
of
their
and
because
of
their
are
Psa107:18
Their
soul
abhorreth
all
manner
of
and
they
draw
near
unto
the
gates
of
Psa107:19
Then
they
cry
unto
the
LORD
in
their
and
he
saveth
them
out
of
their
Psa107:20
He
sent
his
and
healed
and
delivered
them
from
their
Psa107:21
Oh
that
men
would
praise
the
LORD
for
his
and
for
his
wonderful
works
to
the
children
of
Psa107:22
And
let
them
sacrifice
the
sacrifices
of
and
declare
his
works
with
Psa107:23
They
that
go
down
to
the
sea
in
that
do
business
in
great
Psa107:24
These
see
the
works
of
the
and
his
wonders
in
the
Psa107:25
For
he
commandeth,
and
raiseth
the
stormy
which
lifteth
up
the
waves
Psa107:26
They
mount
up
to
the
they
go
down
again
to
the
their
soul
is
melted
because
of
Psa107:27
They
reel
to
and
and
stagger
like
a
drunken
and
are
at
their
wit's
Psa107:28
Then
they
cry
unto
the
LORD
in
their
and
he
bringeth
them
out
of
their
Psa107:29
He
maketh
the
storm
a
so
that
the
waves
thereof
are
Psa107:30
Then
are
they
glad
because
they
be
so
he
bringeth
them
unto
their
desired
Psa107:31
Oh
that
men
would
praise
the
LORD
for
his
and
for
his
wonderful
works
to
the
children
of
Psa107:32
Let
them
exalt
him
also
in
the
congregation
of
the
and
praise
him
in
the
assembly
of
the
Psa107:33
He
turneth
rivers
into
a
and
the
watersprings
into
dry
Psa107:34
A
fruitful
land
into
for
the
wickedness
of
them
that
dwell
Psa107:35
He
turneth
the
wilderness
into
a
standing
and
dry
ground
into
watersprings.
Psa107:36
And
there
he
maketh
the
hungry
to
that
they
may
prepare
a
city
for
Psa107:37
And
sow
the
and
plant
which
may
yield
fruits
of
Psa107:38
He
blesseth
them
so
that
they
are
multiplied
and
suffereth
not
their
cattle
to
Psa107:39
they
are
minished
and
brought
low
through
and
Psa107:40
He
poureth
contempt
upon
and
causeth
them
to
wander
in
the
where
there
is
no
Psa107:41
Yet
setteth
he
the
poor
on
high
from
and
maketh
him
families
like
a

The
righteous
shall
see

all
iniquity
shall
stop

Whoso

Hold

For

wicked
and

mouth
of
the
deceitful
are
opened
against
they
have
spoken
against
me
with
a
lying
Psa109:3
They
compassed
me
about
also
with
words
of

fought
against
me
without
a

For
my
love
they
are

I
give
myself
unto

And
they
have
rewarded
me
evil
for

hatred
for

Set
thou
a
wicked
man
over
and
let
Satan
stand
at

right
Psa109:7
When
he
shall
be
let
him
be

let
his
prayer
become

Let
his
days
be

let
another
take

Let
his
children
be

his
wife

Let
his
children
be
continually
and
let
them
seek
their
bread
also
out
of
their
desolate
Psa109:11
Let
the
extortioner
catch
all
that
he
and
let
the
strangers
spoil
his
Psa109:12
Let
there
be
none
to
extend
mercy
unto
neither
let
there
be
any
to
favour
his
fatherless
Psa109:13
Let
his
posterity
be
cut
and
in
the
generation
following
let
their
name
be
blotted
Psa109:14
Let
the
iniquity
of
his
fathers
be
remembered
with
the
and
let
not
the
sin
of
his
mother
be
blotted
Psa109:15
Let
them
be
before
the
LORD
that
he
may
cut
off
the
memory
of
them
from
the
Psa109:16
Because
that
he
remembered
not
to
shew
but
persecuted
the
poor
and
needy
that
he
might
even
slay
the
broken

Psa109:17
As
he
loved
so
let
it
come
unto
as
he
delighted
not
in
so
let
it
be
far
from
Psa109:18
As
he
clothed
himself
with
cursing
like
as
with
his
so
let
it
come
into
his
bowels
like
and
like
oil
into
his
Psa109:19
Let
it
be
unto
him
as
the
garment
which
covereth
and
for
a
girdle
wherewith
he
is
girded
Psa109:20
Let
this
be
the
reward
of
mine
adversaries
from
the
and
of
them
that
speak
evil
against
my

But
do
thou
for
O
GOD
the
for
thy
name's
because
thy
mercy
is
deliver
thou
Psa109:22
For
I
am
poor
and
and
my
heart
is
wounded
within
Psa109:23
I
am
gone
like
the
shadow
when
it
declineth:
I
am
tossed
up
and
down
as
the
Psa109:24
My
knees
are
weak
through
and
my
flesh
faileth
of
Psa109:25
I
became
also
a
reproach
unto
when
they
looked
upon
me
they
shaked
their
Psa109:26
Help
O
LORD
my
O
save
me
according
to
thy

That
they
may
know
that
this
is
thy
that

Let

themselves
with
their
own
as
with

I
will
greatly
praise
the

wicked
have
robbed
but

have
not
forgotten

forged
a
lie
against

better
unto
me

have
made

those
that
fear
thee
turn
unto

that
have
known

Psa119:85
The
proud
have
digged
pits
for
which
are
not
after
thy
Psa119:86
All
thy
commandments
are
they
persecute
me
help
thou
Psa119:87
They
had
almost
consumed
me
upon
but
I
forsook
not
thy
Psa119:88
Quicken
me
after
thy
lovingkindness;
so
shall
I
keep
the
testimony
of
thy
Psa119:89
For
O
thy
word
is
settled
in
Psa119:90
Thy
faithfulness
is
unto
all
thou
hast
established
the
and
it
abideth.
Psa119:91
They
continue
this
day
according
to
thine
for
all
are
thy
Psa119:92
Unless
thy
law
had
been
my
I
should
then
have
perished
in
mine
Psa119:93
I
will
never
forget
thy
for
with
them
thou
hast
quickened
Psa119:94
I
am
save
for
I
have
sought
thy
Psa119:95
The
wicked
have
waited
for
me
to
destroy
but
I
will
consider
thy
Psa119:96
I
have
seen
an
end
of
all
but
thy
commandment
is
exceeding
Psa119:97
O
how
love
I
thy
it
is
my
meditation
all
the
Psa119:98
Thou
through
thy
commandments
hast
made
me
wiser
than
mine
for
they
are
ever
with
Psa119:99
I
have
more
understanding
than
all
my
for
thy
testimonies
are
my
Psa119:100
I
understand
more
than
the
because
I
keep
thy
Psa119:101
I
have
refrained
my
feet
from
every
evil
that
I
might
keep
thy
Psa119:102
I
have
not
departed
from
thy
for
thou
hast
taught
Psa119:103
How
sweet
are
thy
words
unto
my
sweeter
than
honey
to
my
Psa119:104
Through
thy
precepts
I
get
therefore
I
hate
every
false
Psa119:105
Thy
word
is
a
lamp
unto
my
and
a
light
unto
my
Psa119:106
I
have
and
I
will
perform
that
I
will
keep
thy
righteous
Psa119:107
I
am
afflicted
very
quicken
O
according
unto
thy
Psa119:108
I
beseech
the
freewill
offerings
of
my
O
and
teach
me
thy
Psa119:109
My
soul
is
continually
in
my
yet
do
I
not
forget
thy
Psa119:110
The
wicked
have
laid
a
snare
for
yet
I
erred
not
from
thy
Psa119:111
Thy
testimonies
have
I
taken
as
an
heritage
for
for
they
are
the
rejoicing
of
my
Psa119:112
I
have
inclined
mine
heart
to
perform
thy
statutes
even
unto
the
Psa119:113
I
hate
vain
but
thy
law
do
I
Psa119:114
Thou
art
my
hiding
place
and
my
I
hope
in
thy
Psa119:115
Depart
from
ye
for
I
will
keep
the
commandments
of
my
Psa119:116
Uphold
me
according
unto
thy
that
I
may
and
let
me
not
be
ashamed
of
my
Psa119:117
Hold
thou
me
and
I
shall
be
and
I
will
have
respect
unto
thy
statutes
Psa119:118
Thou
hast
trodden
down
all
them
that
err
from
thy
for
their
deceit
is
Psa119:119
Thou
puttest
away
all
the
wicked
of
the
earth
like
therefore
I
love
thy
Psa119:120
My
flesh
trembleth
for
fear
of

I
am
afraid
of
thy
Psa119:121
I
have
done
judgment
and
leave
me
not
to
mine
Psa119:122
Be
surety
for
thy
servant
for
let
not
the
proud
oppress
Psa119:123
Mine
eyes
fail
for
thy
and
for
the
word
of
thy
Psa119:124
Deal
with
thy
servant
according
unto
thy
and
teach
me
thy

I
am
thy
give

that
I
may
know
thy
Psa119:126
It
is
time
for
to
for
they
have
made
void
thy
Psa119:127
Therefore
I
love
thy
commandments
above
above
fine
Psa119:128
Therefore
I
esteem
all
thy
precepts
concerning
all
things
to
be
and
I
hate
every
false
Psa119:129
Thy
testimonies
are

doth
my
soul

The
entrance
of
thy
words
giveth

giveth
understanding

the
Psa119:131
I
opened
my
and
for
I
longed
for
thy
Psa119:132
Look
thou
upon
and
be
merciful
unto
as
thou
usest
to
do
unto
those
that
love
thy
Psa119:133
Order
my
steps
in
thy
and
let
not
any
iniquity
have
dominion
over
Psa119:134
Deliver
me
from
the
oppression
of
so
will
I
keep
thy
Psa119:135
Make
thy
face
to
shine
upon
thy
and
teach
me
thy
Psa119:136
Rivers
of
waters
run
down
mine
because
they
keep
not
thy
Psa119:137
Righteous
art
O
and
upright
are
thy
Psa119:138
Thy
testimonies
that
thou
hast
commanded
are
righteous
and
very
Psa119:139
My
zeal
hath
consumed
because
mine
enemies
have
forgotten
thy
Psa119:140
Thy
word
is
very
therefore
thy
servant
loveth
Psa119:141
I
am
small
and
yet
do
not
I
forget
thy
Psa119:142
Thy
righteousness
is
an
everlasting
and
thy
law
is
the
Psa119:143
Trouble
and
anguish
have
taken
hold
on

thy
commandments
are
my
Psa119:144
The
righteousness
of
thy
testimonies
is
give

and
I
shall

I
cried
with
my
whole
hear
O
I
will
keep
thy

I
cried
unto
save
and
I
shall
keep
thy
Psa119:147
I
prevented
the
dawning
of
the

I
hoped
in
thy
Psa119:148
Mine
eyes
prevent
the
night
that
I
might
meditate
in
thy
Psa119:149
Hear
my
voice
according
unto
thy
lovingkindness:
O
quicken

according
to

They
draw
nigh
that
follow
after

Concerning

Salvation
is

Great
are
thy
tender
O
quicken

according

thy
Psa119:157
Many
are
my
persecutors
and
mine

do
I
not
decline
from

I
beheld
the

they
kept
not

Consider
how
I
love
thy
quicken
O
according

thy
lovingkindness.
Psa119:160
Thy
word
is
true
from
the
and
every
one
of
thy
righteous
judgments
endureth
for

Princes
have
persecuted
me
without

my
heart
standeth
in
awe
of
thy

I
rejoice
at
thy

Let

Let
my
supplication
come

deliver
me
according
to
thy
Psa119:171
My
lips
shall
utter
when
thou
hast
taught
me
thy
Psa119:172
My
tongue
shall
speak
of
thy
for
all
thy
commandments

Psa119:173
Let
thine
hand
help

In

I
cried
unto

Deliver

Sharp

Woe

Psa120:6
My
soul
hath
long
dwelt
with
him
that
hateth

shall
preserve
thee
from

The
LORD
shall
preserve
thy
going
out
and
thy
coming
in
from
this
time
and
even
for

I
was
glad
when
they
said
unto
Let

For

Peace

Because
of
the

I
will
seek
thy
Psa123:1
Unto
thee
lift
I
up
mine
O
thou
that
dwellest
in

Psa123:2
as
the
eyes
of
servants
look
unto

hand
of
their

as
the
eyes
of
a
maiden
unto

hand
of
her
mist

so
our
eyes
wait
upon
the
LORD
our

Have
mercy
upon

have
mercy
upon

we
are
exceedingly
filled
with

Our
soul
is
exceedingly
filled
with
the
scorning
of
those
that
are

with
the
contempt

men
rose
up
against

Then
they
had
swallowed
us
up
when
their
wrath
was
kindled
against

Then
the
waters
had
overwhelmed
the
stream

gone
over

Then
the
proud
waters
had
gone
over

Psa124:6
Blessed
be
the
who
hath
not
given
us
as
a
prey
to
their

Our
soul
is
escaped
as
a
bird
out
of

snare
of

fowlers:
the
snare

Our
help

They

For

lead
them
forth

When

By
his

My

not

thine

sound
wisdom

Prv3:22
So
shall
they
be
life
unto
thy
and
grace
to
thy
Prv3:23
Then
shalt
thou
walk
in
thy
way

When
thou
liest
thou

not

thou

Be
not
afraid
of

neither
of

For
the
LORD
shall
be

Withhold
not

it
is
in

power
of
thine

Say

Devise
not

Strive
not

done
thee
no
Prv3:31
Envy
thou
not
the

choose
none
of

For
the
froward
is
abomination
to
the
but
his
secret
is
with
the
Prv3:33
The
curse
of

LORD
is
in

he
blesseth
the
habitation

Surely
he
scorneth
the
scorners:
but
he
giveth

The

For
I
give
you
good
forsake
ye
not

For
I
was
my
father's
tender
and
only
beloved
in
the
sight
of
my
Prv4:4
He
taught
me
and
said
unto
Let
thine

Forsake

Wisdom
is
the
principal
therefore
get

with
all
thy
getting
get
Prv4:8
Exalt
and
she

promote
she
shall
bring
thee
to
when
thou

Prv4:9
She
shall
give

thine

she
deliver

Prv4:10
O
my

I
have
taught
thee
in
the
way
of
I
have
led
thee
in
right
Prv4:12
When
thou
goest,
thy
steps

when
thou
runnest,
thou
shalt
not

Take
fast

Enter
not

evil
Prv4:15
Avoid

not

pass
Prv4:16
For
they
sleep
except
they
have
done
and
their
sleep
is
taken
unless
they
cause
some
to
Prv4:17
For
they
eat
the
bread
of
and
drink
the
wine
of
Prv4:18
But
the
path
of
the
just
is
as
the
shining
that
shineth
more
and
more
unto
the
perfect
Prv4:19
The
way
of
the
wicked
is
as
they
know
not
at
what
they
Prv4:20
My
attend

Prv4:21
Let

thine
Prv4:22
For
they
are
life
unto
those
that
find

health
to
all
their
Prv4:23
Keep
thy
heart
with
all
for
out
of
it
are
the
issues
of
Prv4:24
Put
away
from
thee
a
froward
and
perverse
lips
put
far
from
Prv4:25
Let
thine
eyes
look
right
and
let
thine
eyelids
look
straight
before
Prv4:26
Ponder
the
path
of
thy
and
let
all
thy
ways
be
Prv4:27
Turn
not
to
the
right
hand
nor
to
the
remove
thy
foot
from
Prv5:1
My
attend
unto
my
and
bow
thine
ear
to
my
Prv5:2
That
thou
mayest
regard
and
that
thy
lips
may
keep
Prv5:3
For
the
lips
of
a
strange
woman
drop
as
an
and
her
mouth
is
smoother
than
Prv5:4
But
her
end
is
bitter
as
sharp
as
a
two-edged
Prv5:5
Her
feet
go
down
to
her
steps
take
hold
on
Prv5:6
Lest
thou
shouldest
ponder
the
path
of
her
ways
are
moveable,
that
thou
canst
not
know
Prv5:7
Hear
me
now
O
ye
and
depart
not
from
the
words
of
my
Prv5:8
Remove
thy
way
far
from
and
come
not
nigh
the
door
of
her
Prv5:9
Lest
thou
give
thine
honour
unto
and
thy
years
unto
the
Prv5:10
Lest
strangers
be
filled
with
thy
and
thy
labours
be
in
the
house
of
a
Prv5:11
And
thou
mourn
at
the
when
thy
flesh
and
thy
body
are
Prv5:12
And
How
have
I
hated
and
my
heart
despised
Prv5:13
And
have
not
obeyed
the
voice
of
my
nor
inclined
mine
ear
to
them
that
instructed
Prv5:14
I
was
almost
in
all
evil
in
the
midst
of
the
congregation
and
Prv5:15
Drink
waters
out
of
thine
own
and
running
waters
out
of
thine
own
Prv5:16
Let
thy
fountains
be
dispersed
and
rivers
of
waters
in
the
Prv5:17
Let
them
be
only
thine
and
not
with
Prv5:18
Let
thy
fountain
be
and
rejoice
with
the
wife
of
thy
Prv5:19
Let
her
be
as
the
loving
hind
and
pleasant
let
her
breasts
satisfy
thee
at
all
and
be
thou
ravished
always
with
her
Prv5:20
And
why
wilt
my
be
ravished
with
a
strange
and
embrace
the
bosom
of
a
Prv5:21
For
the
ways
of
man
are
before
the
eyes
of
the
and
he
pondereth
all
his
Prv5:22
His
own
iniquities
shall
take
the
wicked
and
he
shall
be
holden
with
the
cords
of
his
Prv5:23
He
shall
die
without
and
in
the
greatness
of
his
folly
he
shall
go
Prv6:1
My
if
thou
be
surety
for
thy
if
thou
hast
stricken
thy
hand
with
a
Prv6:2
Thou
art
snared
with
the
words
of
thy
thou
art
taken
with
the
words
of
thy
Prv6:3
Do
this
my
and
deliver
when
thou
art
come
into
the
hand
of
thy
humble
and
make
sure
thy
Prv6:4
Give
not
sleep
to
thine
nor
slumber
to
thine
Prv6:5
Deliver
thyself
as
a
roe
from
the
hand
of
the
and
as
a
bird
from
the
hand
of
the
Prv6:6
Go
to
the
thou
consider
her
and
be
Prv6:7
Which
having
no
or
Prv6:8
Provideth
her
meat
in
the
and
gathereth
her
food
in
the
Prv6:9
How
long
wilt
thou
O
when
wilt
thou
arise
out
of
thy
Prv6:10
Yet
a
little
a
little
a
little
folding
of
the
hands
to
Prv6:11
So
shall
thy
poverty
come
as
one
that
travelleth,
and
thy
want
as
an
armed
Prv6:12
A
naughty
a
wicked
walketh
with
a
froward
Prv6:13
He
winketh
with
his
he
speaketh
with
his
he
teacheth
with
his
Prv6:14
Frowardness
is
in
his
he
deviseth
mischief
he
soweth
Prv6:15
Therefore
shall
his
calamity
come
suddenly
shall
he
be
broken
without
Prv6:16
These
six
things
doth
the
LORD
seven
are
an
abomination
unto
Prv6:17
A
proud
a
lying
and
hands
that
shed
innocent
Prv6:18
An
heart
that
deviseth
wicked
feet
that
be
swift
in
running
to
Prv6:19
A
false
witness
that
speaketh
and
he
that
soweth
discord
among
Prv6:20
My
keep
thy
father's
and
forsake
not
the
law
of
thy
Prv6:21
Bind
them
continually
upon
thine
and
tie
them
about
thy
Prv6:22
When
thou
goest,
it
shall
lead
when
thou
sleepest,
it
shall
keep
and
when
thou
awakest,
it
shall
talk
with
thee
.
Prv6:23
For
the
commandment
is
a
and
the
law
is
and
reproofs
of
instruction
are
the
way
of
Prv6:24
To
keep
thee
from
the
evil
from
the
flattery
of
the
tongue
of
a
strange
Prv6:25
Lust
not
after
her
beauty
in
thine
neither
let
her
take
thee
with
her
Prv6:26
For
by
means
of
a
whorish
woman
a
man
is
brought
to
a
piece
of
and
the
adulteress
will
hunt
for
the
precious
Prv6:27
Can
a
man
take
fire
in
his
and
his
clothes
not
be
Prv6:28
Can
one
go
upon
hot
and
his
feet
not
be
Prv6:29
So
he
that
goeth
in
to
his
neighbour's
whosoever
toucheth
her
shall
not
be
Prv6:30
Men
do
not
despise
a
if
he
steal
to
satisfy
his
soul
when
he
is
Prv6:31
But
if
he
be
he
shall
restore
he
shall
give
all
the
substance
of
his
Prv6:32
But
whoso
committeth
adultery
with
a
woman
lacketh
he
that
doeth
it
destroyeth
his
own
Prv6:33
A
wound
and
dishonour
shall
he
and
his
reproach
shall
not
be
wiped
Prv6:34
For
jealousy
is
the
rage
of
a
therefore
he
will
not
spare
in
the
day
of
Prv6:35
He
will
not
regard
any
neither
will
he
rest
though
thou
givest
many
Prv7:1
My
keep
my
and
lay
up
my
commandments
with
Prv7:2
Keep
my
and
and
my
law
as
the
apple
of
thine
Prv7:3
Bind
them
upon
thy
write
them
upon
the
table
of
thine
Prv7:4
Say
unto
Thou
art
my
and
call
understanding
thy
Prv7:5
That
they
may
keep
thee
from
the
strange
from
the
stranger
which
flattereth
with
her
Prv7:6
For
at
the
window
of
my
house
I
looked
through
my
Prv7:7
And
beheld
among
the
simple
I
discerned
among
the
a
young
man
void
of
Prv7:8
Passing
through
the
street
near
her
and
he
went
the
way
to
her
Prv7:9
In
the
in
the
in
the
black
and
dark
Prv7:10
there
met
him
a
woman
with
the
attire
of
an
and
subtil
of
Prv7:11
(She
is
loud
and
her
feet
abide
not
in
her
Prv7:12
Now
is
she
now
in
the
and
lieth
in
wait
at
every
corner.)
Prv7:13
So
she
caught
and
kissed
and
with
an
impudent
face
said
unto
Prv7:14
I
have
peace
offerings
with
this
day
have
I
payed
my
Prv7:15
Therefore
came
I
forth
to
meet
diligently
to
seek
thy
and
I
have
found
Prv7:16
I
have
decked
my
bed
with
coverings
of
with
carved
with
fine
linen
of
Prv7:17
I
have
perfumed
my
bed
with
and
Prv7:18
let
us
take
our
fill
of
love
until
the
let
us
solace
ourselves
with
Prv7:19
For
the
goodman
is
not
at
he
is
gone
a
long
Prv7:20
He
hath
taken
a
bag
of
money
with
and
will
come
home
at
the
day
Prv7:21
With
her
much
fair
speech
she
caused
him
to
with
the
flattering
of
her
lips
she
forced
Prv7:22
He
goeth
after
her
as
an
ox
goeth
to
the
or
as
a
fool
to
the
correction
of
the
Prv7:23
Till
a
dart
strike
through
his
as
a
bird
hasteth
to
the
and
knoweth
not
that
it
is
for
his
Prv7:24
Hearken
unto
me
now
O
ye
and
attend
to
the
words
of
my
Prv7:25
Let
not
thine
heart
decline
to
her
go
not
astray
in
her
Prv7:26
For
she
hath
cast
down
many
many
strong
men
have
been
slain
by
Prv7:27
Her
house
is
the
way
to
going
down
to
the
chambers
of
Prv8:1
Doth
not
wisdom
and
understanding
put
forth
her
Prv8:2
She
standeth
in
the
top
of
high
by
the
way
in
the
places
of
the
Prv8:3
She
crieth
at
the
at
the
entry
of
the
at
the
coming
in
at
the
Prv8:4
Unto
O
I
and
my
voice
is
to
the
sons
of
Prv8:5
O
ye
understand
ye
be
ye
of
an
understanding
Prv8:6
for
I
will
speak
of
excellent
and
the
opening
of
my
lips
shall
be
right
Prv8:7
For
my
mouth
shall
speak
and
wickedness
is
an
abomination
to
my
Prv8:8
All
the
words
of
my
mouth
are
in
there
is
nothing
froward
or
perverse
in
Prv8:9
They
are
all
plain
to
him
that
understandeth,
and
right
to
them
that
find
Prv8:10
Receive
my
and
not
and
knowledge
rather
than
choice
Prv8:11
For
wisdom
is
better
than
and
all
the
things
that
may
be
desired
are
not
to
be
compared
to
Prv8:12
I
wisdom
dwell
with
and
find
out
knowledge
of
witty
Prv8:13
The
fear
of
the
LORD
is
to
hate
and
arrogancy,
and
the
evil
and
the
froward
do
I
Prv8:14
Counsel
is
and
sound
I
am
I
have
Prv8:15
By
me
kings
and
princes
decree
Prv8:16
By
me
princes
and
even
all
the
judges
of
the
Prv8:17
I
love
them
that
love
and
those
that
seek
me
early
shall
find
Prv8:18
Riches
and
honour
are
with
durable
riches
and
Prv8:19
My
fruit
is
better
than
than
fine
and
my
revenue
than
choice
Prv8:20
I
lead
in
the
way
of
in
the
midst
of
the
paths
of
Prv8:21
That
I
may
cause
those
that
love
me
to
inherit
and
I
will
fill
their
Prv8:22
The
LORD
possessed
me
in
the
beginning
of
his
before
his
works
of
Prv8:23
I
was
set
up
from
from
the
or
ever
the
earth
Prv8:24
When
there
were
no
I
was
brought
when
there
were
no
fountains
abounding
with
Prv8:25
Before
the
mountains
were
before
the
hills
was
I
brought
Prv8:26
While
as
yet
he
had
not
made
the
nor
the
nor
the
highest
part
of
the
dust
of
the
Prv8:27
When
he
prepared
the
I
was
when
he
set
a
compass
upon
the
face
of
the
Prv8:28
When
he
established
the
clouds
when
he
strengthened
the
fountains
of
the
Prv8:29
When
he
gave
to
the
sea
his
that
the
waters
should
not
pass
his
when
he
appointed
the
foundations
of
t
he
Prv8:30
Then
I
was
by
as
one
brought
up
with
and
I
was
daily
his
rejoicing
always
before
Prv8:31
Rejoicing
in
the
habitable
part
of
his
and
my
delights
were
with
the
sons
of
Prv8:32
Now
therefore
hearken
unto
O
ye
for
blessed
are
they
that
keep
my
Prv8:33
Hear
and
be
and
refuse
it
Prv8:34
Blessed
is
the
man
that
heareth
watching
daily
at
my
waiting
at
the
posts
of
my
Prv8:35
For
whoso
findeth
me
findeth
and
shall
obtain
favour
of
the
Prv8:36
But
he
that
sinneth
against
me
wrongeth
his
own
all
they
that
hate

Wisdom

She

sent
forth

Whoso

turn
in

in
the
want
of

the
destruction
of

He
that

slow
to
wrath
is
of
great
but
he
that
is
hasty
of
spirit
exalteth
Prv14:30
A
sound
heart
is
the
life
of
the
but
envy
the
rottenness
of
the
Prv14:31
He
that
oppresseth
the
poor
reproacheth
his
but
he
that
honoureth
him
hath
mercy
on
the
Prv14:32
The
wicked
is
driven
away
in
his
but
the
righteous
hath
hope
in
his
Prv14:33
Wisdom
resteth
in
the
heart
of
him
that
hath
but
that
which
is
in
the
midst
of
fools
is
made
Prv14:34
Righteousness
exalteth
a
but
sin
is
a
reproach
to
any
Prv14:35
The
king's
favour
is
toward
a
wise
but
his
wrath
is
against
him
that
causeth
Prv15:1
A
soft
answer
turneth
away
but
grievous
words
stir
up
Prv15:2
The
tongue
of
the
wise
useth
knowledge
but
the
mouth
of
fools
poureth
out
Prv15:3
The
eyes
of
the
LORD
are
in
every
beholding
the
evil
and
the
Prv15:4
A
wholesome
tongue
is
a
tree
of

perverseness
therein
is
a
breach
in
the
Prv15:5
A
fool
despiseth
his
father's
but
he
that
regardeth
reproof
is
Prv15:6
In
the
house
of
the
righteous
is
much

in
the
revenues
of
the
wicked
is
Prv15:7
The
lips
of
the
wise
disperse
but
the
heart
of
the
foolish
doeth
not
Prv15:8
The
sacrifice
of
the
wicked
is
an
abomination
to
the
but
the
prayer
of
the
upright
is
his
Prv15:9
The
way
of
the
wicked
is
an
abomination
unto
the
but
he
loveth
him
that
followeth
after
Prv15:10
Correction
is
grievous
unto
him
that
forsaketh
the
and
he
that
hateth
reproof
shall
Prv15:11
Hell
and
destruction
are
before

how
much
more
then
the
hearts
of
the
children
of

A
scorner
loveth
not
one
that
reproveth
neither
will
he
go
unto
the
Prv15:13
A
merry
heart
maketh
a
cheerful
but
by
sorrow
of
the
heart
the
spirit
is
Prv15:14
The
heart
of
him
that
hath
understanding
seeketh
but
the
mouth
of
fools
feedeth

All
the
days
of
the
afflicted
are
but
he
that
is
of
a
merry
heart
hath
a
continual

Better
is
little
with
the
fear
of

LORD
than
great
treasure

trouble
Prv15:17
Better
is
a
dinner
of
herbs
where
love

hatred
Prv15:18
A
wrathful
man
stirreth
up
but
he
that
is
slow
to
anger
appeaseth
Prv15:19
The
way
of
the
slothful
man
is
as
an
hedge
of

the
way
of
the
righteous
is
made
Prv15:20
A
wise
son
maketh
a
glad
but
a
foolish
man
despiseth
his
Prv15:21
Folly
is
joy
to
him
that
is
destitute
of

a
man
of
understanding
walketh
Prv15:22
Without
counsel
purposes
are
but
in
the
multitude
of
counsellors
they
are
Prv15:23
A
man
hath
joy
by
the
answer
of
his
and
a
word
spoken
in
due
how
good
is
Prv15:24
The
way
of
life
is
above
to
the
that
he
may
depart
from

Prv15:25
The
LORD
will
destroy
the
house
of
the
but
he
will
establish
the
border
of

The
thoughts
of
the
wicked
are
an
abomination
to
the
but
the
words
of
the
pure
are
pleasant
Prv15:27
He
that
is
greedy
of
gain
troubleth
his
own
but
he
that
hateth
gifts
shall
Prv15:28
The
heart
of
the
righteous
studieth
to

the
mouth
of
the
wicked
poureth
out
evil
Prv15:29
The
LORD
is
far
from
the
but
he
heareth
the
prayer
of
the
Prv15:30
The
light
of
the
eyes
rejoiceth
the
and
a
good
report
maketh
the
bones
Prv15:31
The
ear
that
heareth
the
reproof
of
life
abideth
among
the
Prv15:32
He
that
refuseth
instruction
despiseth
his
own

he
that
heareth
reproof
getteth

The
fear
of
the
LORD
is
the
instruction
of

Prv16:1
The
preparations
of
the
heart
in

the
answer
of

is
from
the
Prv16:2
All
the
ways
of
a

are
clean
in
his
own
but
the
LORD
weigheth
the
Prv16:3
Commit
thy
works
unto

The
LORD
hath
made
all
things
for
even
the
wicked
for
the
day
of

Every
one
that
is
proud
in
heart
is
an
abomination
to
the
though

Prv16:6
By
mercy
and
truth
iniquity
is

by
the
fear
of
the
LORD
men
depart
from

When
a
man's
ways
please
the
he
maketh
even
his
enemies
to
be
at
peace
with

Better
is
a
little
with
righteousness
than
great
revenues
without

A
man's
heart
deviseth
his

the
LORD
directeth

Prv16:10
A
divine
sentence
is
in
the
lips
of

his
mouth
transgresseth
not
in
Prv16:11
A
just
weight
and
balance
are
the
all
the
weights
of
the
bag
are
his
Prv16:12
It
is
an
abomination
to
kings
to
commit

throne

established
by
Prv16:13
Righteous
lips
are
the
delight
of

they
love
him
that
speaketh
Prv16:14
The
wrath
of
a
king
is
as
messengers
of

a
wise
man
will
pacify

In
the
light
of
the
king's
countenance
is
and
his
favour
is
as
a
cloud
of
the
latter
Prv16:16
How
much
better
is
it
to
get
wisdom
than
and
to
get
understanding
rather
to
be
chosen
than
Prv16:17
The
highway
of
the
upright
is
to
depart
from

that
keepeth
his
way
preserveth
his
Prv16:18
Pride
goeth
before

an
haughty
spirit
before

Better
it
is
to
be
of
an
humble
spirit
with
the
than
to
divide
the
spoil
with

He
that
handleth
a
matter
wisely
shall
find

whoso
trusteth
in
the
happy
is
Prv16:21
The
wise
in
heart
shall
be
called
and
the
sweetness
of
the
lips
increaseth
Prv16:22
Understanding
is
a
wellspring
of
life
unto
him
that
hath

the
instruction
of
fools
is
Prv16:23
The
heart
of
the
wise
teacheth
his

addeth
learning
to
his
Prv16:24
Pleasant
words
are
as
an
sweet
to
the
and
health
to
the
Prv16:25
There
is
a
way
that
seemeth
right
unto
a
but
the
end
thereof
are
the
ways
of
Prv16:26
He
that
laboureth
laboureth

his
mouth
craveth
it
of

An
ungodly
man
diggeth
up
and
in
his
lips
there
is
as
a
burning
Prv16:28
A
froward
man
soweth

a
whisperer
separateth

A
violent
man
enticeth
his

leadeth
him
into
the
way
that

not

He
shutteth
his
eyes
to
devise
froward
moving
his
lips
he
bringeth
evil
to

The
hoary
head
is
a
crown
of
if
it
be
found
in
the
way
of
Prv16:32
He
that
is
slow
to
anger
is
better
than
the
and
he
that
ruleth
his
spirit
than
he
that
taketh
a
Prv16:33
The
lot
is
cast
into
the
but
the
whole
disposing
thereof
is
of
the
Prv17:1
Better
is
a
dry
and
quietness
than
an
house
full
of
sacrifices
with
Prv17:2
A
wise
servant
shall
have
rule
over
a
son
that

The
fining
pot

A
wicked
doer
giveth
heed
to
false

a
liar
giveth
ear
to
a
naughty

Whoso
mocketh
the
poor
reproacheth
his

that

glad
at
calamities

Children's

Excellent
speech
becometh
not

A
gift
is
as
a
precious
stone
in
the
eyes
of
him
that

it
turneth,
it
prospereth.
Prv17:9
He
that
covereth
a
transgression
seeketh
but
he
that
repeateth
a
matter
separateth
very
Prv17:10
A
reproof
entereth
more
into
a
wise
man
than
an
hundred
stripes
into

Prv17:11
An
evil
man
seeketh

therefore
a
cruel
messenger
shall
be
sent
against

Let
a
bear
robbed
of

Whoso
rewardeth

The
beginning
of

as
when

He
that
justifieth

that
condemneth

both
are
abomination
to

Wherefore
is
there
a
price
in
the
hand
of
a
fool
to
get

hath
no
heart

A

A

void
of

striketh

He
loveth

that

He
that
hath
a
froward
heart
findeth

a
perverse
tongue
falleth

He

A

A
wicked
man
taketh
a
gift
out
of

bosom
to
pervert
the
ways

Wisdom
is
before
him
that

the
eyes
of
a

A
foolish
son
is
a
grief
to

Also
to
punish
the
just
is
not
nor
to
strike
princes
for

He
that
hath
knowledge
spareth
his

a

of

Even
a

When

The
words
of
a
man's
mouth
are
as
deep

the
wellspring
of

It
is
not
good
to
accept
the

A
fool's
lips
enter
into

A
fool's
mouth
is
his

his
lips
are
the
snare
of

Prv18:8
The
words
of
a
talebearer
are
as

they
go
down
into
the
innermost
parts
of

Prv18:9
He
also
that

slothful

The

He
that

folly

The

The
poor

A

shew

there
is
a

The

The

A

There
be
three
things

are

wonderful

four
which
I

The

is
the
way
of

things

for
four
which
it

For
a
servant
when
he
reigneth;
and

fool
when
he
is

For
an
odious
woman
when
she
is

handmaid
that
is

There
be
four
things

are

I
the
Preacher
was
king
over
Israel
in
Eccl1:13
And
I
gave
my
heart
to
seek
and
search
out
by
wisdom
concerning
all
things
that
are
done
under
this
sore
travail
h
ath
God
given
to
the
sons
of
man
to
be
exercised
Eccl1:14
I
have
seen
all
the
works
that
are
done
under
the
all
is
vanity
and
vexation
of
Eccl1:15
That
which
is
crooked
cannot
be
made
and
that
which
is
wanting
cannot
be
Eccl1:16
I
communed
with
mine
own
I
am
come
to
great
and
have
gotten
more
wisdom
than
all
they
that
have
been
before
me
in
my
heart
had
great
experience
of
wisdom
and
Eccl1:17
And
I
gave
my
heart
to
know
and
to
know
madness
and
I
perceived
that
this
also
is
vexation
of
Eccl1:18
For
in
much
wisdom
is
much
and
he
that
increaseth
knowledge
increaseth
Eccl2:1
I
said
in
mine
Go
to
I
will
prove
thee
with
therefore
enjoy
this
also
is
Eccl2:2
I
said
of
It
is
and
of
What
doeth
Eccl2:3
I
sought
in
mine
heart
to
give
myself
unto
yet
acquainting
mine
heart
with
and
to
lay
hold
on
till
I
m
ight
see
what
was
that
good
for
the
sons
of
which
they
should
do
under
the
heaven
all
the
days
of
their
Eccl2:4
I
made
me
great
I
builded
me
I
planted
me
Eccl2:5
I
made
me
gardens
and
and
I
planted
trees
in
them
of
all
kind
of
Eccl2:6
I
made
me
pools
of
to
water
therewith
the
wood
that
bringeth
forth
Eccl2:7
I
got
me
servants
and
and
had
servants
born
in
my
also
I
had
great
possessions
of
great
and
small
cattle
ab
ove
all
that
were
in
Jerusalem
before
Eccl2:8
I
gathered
me
also
silver
and
and
the
peculiar
treasure
of
kings
and
of
the
I
gat
me
men
singers
and
women
and
the
delights
of
the
sons
of
as
musical
and
that
of
all
Eccl2:9
So
I
was
and
increased
more
than
all
that
were
before
me
in
also
my
wisdom
remained
with
Eccl2:10
And
whatsoever
mine
eyes
desired
I
kept
not
from
I
withheld
not
my
heart
from
any
for
my
heart
rejoiced
in
all
my
and
this
was
my
portion
of
all
my
Eccl2:11
Then
I
looked
on
all
the
works
that
my
hands
had
and
on
the
labour
that
I
had
laboured
to
all
wa
s
vanity
and
vexation
of
and
there
was
no
profit
under
the
Eccl2:12
And
I
turned
myself
to
behold
and
and
for
what
can
the
man
do
that
cometh
after
the
even
tha
t
which
hath
been
already
Eccl2:13
Then
I
saw
that
wisdom
excelleth
as
far
as
light
excelleth
Eccl2:14
The
wise
man's
eyes
are
in
his
but
the
fool
walketh
in
and
I
myself
perceived
also
that
one
event
happenet
h
to
them
Eccl2:15
Then
said
I
in
my
As
it
happeneth
to
the
so
it
happeneth
even
to
and
why
was
I
then
more
Then
I
sai
d
in
my
that
this
also
is
Eccl2:16
For
there
is
no
remembrance
of
the
wise
more
than
of
the
fool
for
seeing
that
which
now
is
in
the
days
to
come
shall
all
be
And
how
dieth
the
wise
as
the
Eccl2:17
Therefore
I
hated
because
the
work
that
is
wrought
under
the
sun
is
grievous
unto
for
all
is
vanity
and
vexation
of
Eccl2:18
I
hated
all
my
labour
which
I
had
taken
under
the
because
I
should
leave
it
unto
the
man
that
shall
be
after
Eccl2:19
And
who
knoweth
whether
he
shall
be
a
wise
man
or
a
yet
shall
he
have
rule
over
all
my
labour
wherein
I
have
laboure
d,
and
wherein
I
have
shewed
myself
wise
under
the
This
is
also
Eccl2:20
Therefore
I
went
about
to
cause
my
heart
to
despair
of
all
the
labour
which
I
took
under
the
Eccl2:21
For
there
is
a
man
whose
labour
is
in
and
in
and
in
yet
to
a
man
that
hath
not
laboured
therein
shall
he
leave
it
for
his
This
also
is
vanity
and
a
great
Eccl2:22
For
what
hath
man
of
all
his
and
of
the
vexation
of
his
wherein
he
hath
laboured
under
the
Eccl2:23
For
all
his
days
are
and
his
travail
his
heart
taketh
not
rest
in
the
This
is
also
Eccl2:24
There
is
nothing
better
for
a
than
that
he
should
eat
and
and
that
he
should
make
his
soul
enjoy
good
in
his
l
abour.
This
also
I
that
it
was
from
the
hand
of
Eccl2:25
For
who
can
or
who
else
can
hasten
more
than
Eccl2:26
For
God
giveth
to
a
man
that
is
good
in
his
sight
and
and
but
to
the
sinner
he
giveth
to
gather
and
to
heap
that
he
may
give
to
him
that
is
good
before
This
also
is
vanity
and
vexation
of
Eccl3:1
To
every
thing
there
is
a
and
a
time
to
every
purpose
under
the
Eccl3:2
A
time
to
be
and
a
time
to
a
time
to
and
a
time
to
pluck
up
that
which
is
Eccl3:3
A
time
to
and
a
time
to
a
time
to
break
and
a
time
to
build
Eccl3:4
A
time
to
and
a
time
to
a
time
to
and
a
time
to
Eccl3:5
A
time
to
cast
away
and
a
time
to
gather
stones
a
time
to
and
a
time
to
refrain
from
Eccl3:6
A
time
to
and
a
time
to
a
time
to
and
a
time
to
cast
Eccl3:7
A
time
to
and
a
time
to
a
time
to
keep
and
a
time
to
Eccl3:8
A
time
to
and
a
time
to
a
time
of
and
a
time
of
Eccl3:9
What
profit
hath
he
that
worketh
in
that
wherein
he
laboureth?
Eccl3:10
I
have
seen
the
which
God
hath
given
to
the
sons
of
men
to
be
exercised
in
Eccl3:11
He
hath
made
every
thing
beautiful
in
his
also
he
hath
set
the
world
in
their
so
that
no
man
can
find
out
the
work
that
God
maketh
from
the
beginning
to
the
Eccl3:12
I
know
that
there
is
no
good
in
but
for
a
man
to
and
to
do
good
in
his
Eccl3:13
And
also
that
every
man
should
eat
and
and
enjoy
the
good
of
all
his
it
is
the
gift
of
Eccl3:14
I
know
whatsoever
God
doeth,
it
shall
be
for
nothing
can
be
put
to
nor
any
thing
taken
from
and
God
do
eth
that
men
should
fear
before
Eccl3:15
That
which
hath
been
is
and
that
which
is
to
be
hath
already
and
God
requireth
that
which
is
Eccl3:16
And
moreover
I
saw
under
the
sun
the
place
of
that
wickedness
was
and
the
place
of
that
in
iquity
was
Eccl3:17
I
said
in
mine
God
shall
judge
the
righteous
and
the
for
there
is
a
time
there
for
every
purpose
and
for
ev
ery
Eccl3:18
I
said
in
mine
heart
concerning
the
estate
of
the
sons
of
that
God
might
manifest
and
that
they
might
see
that
they
themselves
are
Eccl3:19
For
that
which
befalleth
the
sons
of
men
befalleth
even
one
thing
befalleth
as
the
one
dieth,
so
dieth
the
o
ther;
they
have
all
one
so
that
a
man
hath
no
preeminence
above
a
for
all
is
Eccl3:20
All
go
unto
one
all
are
of
the
and
all
turn
to
dust
Eccl3:21
Who
knoweth
the
spirit
of
man
that
goeth
and
the
spirit
of
the
beast
that
goeth
downward
to
the
Eccl3:22
Wherefore
I
perceive
that
there
is
nothing
than
that
a
man
should
rejoice
in
his
own
for
that
is
his
portio
n:
for
who
shall
bring
him
to
see
what
shall
be
after
Eccl4:1
So
I
and
considered
all
the
oppressions
that
are
done
under
the
and
behold
the
tears
of
such
as
were
oppress
and
they
had
no

on
the
side
of
their
oppressors
there
was
but
they
had
no
Eccl4:2
Wherefore
I
praised
the
dead
which
are
already
dead
more
than
the
living
which
are
yet
Eccl4:3

is
he
than
both
which
hath
not
yet
who
hath
not
seen
the
evil
work
that
is
done
under
the
Eccl4:4
I
considered
all
and
every
right
that
for
this
a
man
is
envied
of
his
This
is
also
vanity
and
vexation
of
Eccl4:5
The
fool
foldeth
his
hands
and
eateth
his
own
Eccl4:6
Better
is
an
handful
with
than
both
the
hands
full
with
travail
and
vexation
of
Eccl4:7
Then
I
and
I
saw
vanity
under
the
Eccl4:8
There
is
one
and
there
is
not
a
he
hath
neither
child
nor
yet
is
there
no
end
of
all
his
labou
r;
neither
is
his
eye
satisfied
with
neither
saith
For
whom
do
I
and
bereave
my
soul
of
This
is
also
vani
ty,
it
is
a
sore
Eccl4:9
Two
are
better
than
because
they
have
a
good
reward
for
their
Eccl4:10
For
if
they
the
one
will
lift
up
his
but
woe
to
him
that
is
alone
when
he
falleth;
for
he
hath
not
another
t
o
help
him
Eccl4:11
if
two
lie
then
they
have
but
how
can
one
be
warm
Eccl4:12
And
if
one
prevail
against
two
shall
withstand
and
a
threefold
cord
is
not
quickly
Eccl4:13
Better
is
a
poor
and
a
wise
child
than
an
old
and
foolish
who
will
no
more
be
Eccl4:14
For
out
of
prison
he
cometh
to
whereas
also
he
that
is
born
in
his
kingdom
becometh
Eccl4:15
I
considered
all
the
living
which
walk
under
the
with
the
second
child
that
shall
stand
up
in
his
Eccl4:16
There
is
no
end
of
all
the
even
of
all
that
have
been
before
they
also
that
come
after
shall
not
rejoice
in
Surely
this
also
is
vanity
and
vexation
of
Eccl5:1
Keep
thy
foot
when
thou
goest
to
the
house
of
and
be
more
ready
to
than
to
give
the
sacrifice
of
for
they
consider
not
that
they
do
Eccl5:2
Be
not
rash
with
thy
and
let
not
thine
heart
be
hasty
to
utter
any
thing
before
for
God
is
in
and
thou
upon
therefore
let
thy
words
be
Eccl5:3
For
a
dream
cometh
through
the
multitude
of
and
a
fool's
voice
is
known
by
multitude
of
Eccl5:4
When
thou
vowest
a
vow
unto
defer
not
to
pay
for
he
hath
no
pleasure
in
pay
that
which
thou
hast
Eccl5:5
Better
is
it
that
thou
shouldest
not
than
that
thou
shouldest
vow
and
not
Eccl5:6
Suffer
not
thy
mouth
to
cause
thy
flesh
to
neither
say
thou
before
the
that
it
was
an
wherefore
should
G
od
be
angry
at
thy
and
destroy
the
work
of
thine
Eccl5:7
For
in
the
multitude
of
dreams
and
many
words
there
are
also
divers
but
fear
thou
Eccl5:8
If
thou
seest
the
oppression
of
the
and
violent
perverting
of
judgment
and
justice
in
a
marvel
not
at
the
m
atter:
for
he
that
is
higher
than
the
highest
regardeth;
and
there
be
higher
than
Eccl5:9
Moreover
the
profit
of
the
earth
is
for
the
king
himself
is
served
by
the
Eccl5:10
He
that
loveth
silver
shall
not
be
satisfied
with
nor
he
that
loveth
abundance
with
this
is
also
Eccl5:11
When
goods
they
are
increased
that
eat
and
what
good
is
there
to
the
owners
saving
the
beholding
of
them
with
their
Eccl5:12
The
sleep
of
a
labouring
man
is
whether
he
eat
little
or
but
the
abundance
of
the
rich
will
not
suffer
him
to
Eccl5:13
There
is
a
sore
evil
which
I
have
seen
under
the
riches
kept
for
the
owners
thereof
to
their
Eccl5:14
But
those
riches
perish
by
evil
and
he
begetteth
a
and
there
is
nothing
in
his
Eccl5:15
As
he
came
forth
of
his
mother's
naked
shall
he
return
to
go
as
he
and
shall
take
nothing
of
his
which
he
may
carry
away
in
his
Eccl5:16
And
this
also
is
a
sore
that
in
all
points
as
he
so
shall
he
and
what
profit
hath
he
that
hath
laboured
fo
r
the
Eccl5:17
All
his
days
also
he
eateth
in
and
he
hath
much
sorrow
and
wrath
with
his
Eccl5:18
Behold
that
which
I
have
it
is
good
and
comely
for
one
to
eat
and
to
and
to
enjoy
the
good
of
all
his
labour
that
he
taketh
under
the
sun
all
the
days
of
his
which
God
giveth
for
it
is
his
Eccl5:19
Every
man
also
to
whom
God
hath
given
riches
and
and
hath
given
him
power
to
eat
and
to
take
his
and
to
rejoice
in
his
this
is
the
gift
of
Eccl5:20
For
he
shall
not
much
remember
the
days
of
his
because
God
answereth
him
in
the
joy
of
his
Eccl6:1
There
is
an
evil
which
I
have
seen
under
the
and
it
is
common
among
Eccl6:2
A
man
to
whom
God
hath
given
and
so
that
he
wanteth
nothing
for
his
soul
of
all
that
he
desireth,
y
et
God
giveth
him
not
power
to
eat
but
a
stranger
eateth
this
is
and
it
is
an
evil
Eccl6:3
If
a
man
beget
an
hundred
and
live
many
so
that
the
days
of
his
years
be
and
his
soul
be
not
filled
with
and
also
that
he
have
no
I
that
an
untimely
birth
is
better
than
Eccl6:4
For
he
cometh
in
with
and
departeth
in
and
his
name
shall
be
covered
with
Eccl6:5
Moreover
he
hath
not
seen
the
nor
known
any
this
hath
more
rest
than
the
Eccl6:6
though
he
live
a
thousand
years
twice
yet
hath
he
seen
no
do
not
all
go
to
one
Eccl6:7
All
the
labour
of
man
is
for
his
and
yet
the
appetite
is
not
Eccl6:8
For
what
hath
the
wise
more
than
the
what
hath
the
that
knoweth
to
walk
before
the
Eccl6:9
Better
is
the
sight
of
the
eyes
than
the
wandering
of
the
this
is
also
vanity
and
vexation
of
Eccl6:10
That
which
hath
been
is
named
and
it
is
known
that
it
is
neither
may
he
contend
with
him
that
is
mightier
th
an
Eccl6:11
Seeing
there
be
many
things
that
increase
what
is
man
the
Eccl6:12
For
who
knoweth
what
is
good
for
man
in
this
all
the
days
of
his
vain
life
which
he
spendeth
as
a
for
who
ca
n
tell
a
man
what
shall
be
after
him
under
the
Eccl7:1
A
good
name
is
better
than
precious
and
the
day
of
death
than
the
day
of
one's
Eccl7:2
It
is
better
to
go
to
the
house
of
than
to
go
to
the
house
of
for
that
is
the
end
of
all
and
the
l
iving
will
lay
it
to
his
Eccl7:3
Sorrow
is
better
than
for
by
the
sadness
of
the
countenance
the
heart
is
made
Eccl7:4
The
heart
of
the
wise
is
in
the
house
of
but
the
heart
of
fools
is
in
the
house
of
Eccl7:5
It
is
better
to
hear
the
rebuke
of
the
than
for
a
man
to
hear
the
song
of
Eccl7:6
For
as
the
crackling
of
thorns
under
a
so
is
the
laughter
of
the
this
also
is
Eccl7:7
Surely
oppression
maketh
a
wise
man
and
a
gift
destroyeth
the
Eccl7:8
Better
is
the
end
of
a
thing
than
the
beginning
and
the
patient
in
spirit
is
better
than
the
proud
in
Eccl7:9
Be
not
hasty
in
thy
spirit
to
be
for
anger
resteth
in
the
bosom
of
Eccl7:10
Say
not
What
is
the
cause
that
the
former
days
were
better
than
for
thou
dost
not
enquire
wisely
concerning

Eccl7:11
Wisdom
is
good
with
an
and
by
it
there
is
profit
to
them
that
see
the
Eccl7:12
For
wisdom
is
a
and
money
is
a
but
the
excellency
of
knowledge
that
wisdom
giveth
life
to
them
that
have
Eccl7:13
Consider
the
work
of
for
who
can
make
that
which
he
hath
made
Eccl7:14
In
the
day
of
prosperity
be
but
in
the
day
of
adversity
God
also
hath
set
the
one
over
against
the
other
,
to
the
end
that
man
should
find
nothing
after
Eccl7:15
All
things
have
I
seen
in
the
days
of
my
there
is
a
just
man
that
perisheth
in
his
and
there
is
a
w
icked
man
that
prolongeth
his
life
in
his
Eccl7:16
Be
not
righteous
over
neither
make
thyself
over
why
shouldest
thou
destroy
thyself
?
Eccl7:17
Be
not
over
much
neither
be
thou
why
shouldest
thou
die
before
thy
Eccl7:18
It
is
good
that
thou
shouldest
take
hold
of
also
from
this
withdraw
not
thine
for
he
that
feareth
God
sha
ll
come
forth
of
them
Eccl7:19
Wisdom
strengtheneth
the
wise
more
than
ten
mighty
men
which
are
in
the
Eccl7:20
For
there
is
not
a
just
man
upon
that
doeth
and
sinneth
Eccl7:21
Also
take
no
heed
unto
all
words
that
are
lest
thou
hear
thy
servant
curse
Eccl7:22
For
oftentimes
also
thine
own
heart
knoweth
that
thou
thyself
likewise
hast
cursed
Eccl7:23
All
this
have
I
proved
by
I
I
will
be
but
it
was
far
from
Eccl7:24
That
which
is
far
and
exceeding
who
can
find
it
Eccl7:25
I
applied
mine
heart
to
and
to
and
to
seek
out
and
the
reason
of
and
to
know
the
wickedness
of
even
of
foolishness
and
Eccl7:26
And
I
find
more
bitter
than
death
the
whose
heart
is
snares
and
and
her
hands
as
whoso
pleaseth
God
sh
all
escape
from
but
the
sinner
shall
be
taken
by
Eccl7:27
this
have
I
saith
the
counting
one
by
to
find
out
the
Eccl7:28
Which
yet
my
soul
seeketh,
but
I
find
one
man
among
a
thousand
have
I
but
a
woman
among
all
those
have
I
not
f
ound.
Eccl7:29
this
only
have
I
that
God
hath
made
man
but
they
have
sought
out
many
Eccl8:1
Who
is
as
the
wise
and
who
knoweth
the
interpretation
of
a
a
man's
wisdom
maketh
his
face
to
and
the
bol
dness
of
his
face
shall
be
Eccl8:2
I
counsel
thee
to
keep
the
king's
and
that
in
regard
of
the
oath
of
Eccl8:3
Be
not
hasty
to
go
out
of
his
stand
not
in
an
evil
for
he
doeth
whatsoever
pleaseth
Eccl8:4
Where
the
word
of
a
king
there
is
and
who
may
say
unto
What
doest
Eccl8:5
Whoso
keepeth
the
commandment
shall
feel
no
evil
and
a
wise
man's
heart
discerneth
both
time
and
Eccl8:6
Because
to
every
purpose
there
is
time
and
therefore
the
misery
of
man
is
great
upon
Eccl8:7
For
he
knoweth
not
that
which
shall
for
who
can
tell
him
when
it
shall
Eccl8:8
There
is
no
man
that
hath
power
over
the
spirit
to
retain
the
neither
hath
he
power
in
the
day
of
and
there
is
no
discharge
in
that
neither
shall
wickedness
deliver
those
that
are
given
to
Eccl8:9
All
this
have
I
and
applied
my
heart
unto
every
work
that
is
done
under
the
there
is
a
time
wherein
one
man
rule
th
over
another
to
his
own
Eccl8:10
And
so
I
saw
the
wicked
who
had
come
and
gone
from
the
place
of
the
and
they
were
forgotten
in
the
city
wher
e
they
had
so
this
is
also
Eccl8:11
Because
sentence
against
an
evil
work
is
not
executed
therefore
the
heart
of
the
sons
of
men
is
fully
set
in
the
m
to
do
Eccl8:12
Though
a
sinner
do
evil
an
hundred
and
his
days
be
yet
surely
I
know
that
it
shall
be
well
with
them
tha
t
fear
which
fear
before
Eccl8:13
But
it
shall
not
be
well
with
the
neither
shall
he
prolong
his
which
are
as
a
because
he
feareth
not
before
Eccl8:14
There
is
a
vanity
which
is
done
upon
the
that
there
be
just
unto
whom
it
happeneth
according
to
the
work
of
th
e
there
be
wicked
to
whom
it
happeneth
according
to
the
work
of
the
I
said
that
this
also
is
Eccl8:15
Then
I
commended
because
a
man
hath
no
better
thing
under
the
than
to
and
to
and
to
be
for
that
shall
abide
with
him
of
his
labour
the
days
of
his
which
God
giveth
him
under
the
Eccl8:16
When
I
applied
mine
heart
to
know
and
to
see
the
business
that
is
done
upon
the
(for
also
there
is
that
nei
ther
day
nor
night
seeth
sleep
with
his
eyes:)
Eccl8:17
Then
I
beheld
all
the
work
of
that
a
man
cannot
find
out
the
work
that
is
done
under
the
because
though
a
man
la
bour
to
seek
it
yet
he
shall
not
find
yea
though
a
wise
man
think
to
know
yet
shall
he
not
be
able
to
find
it
.
Eccl9:1
For
all
this
I
considered
in
my
heart
even
to
declare
all
that
the
and
the
and
their
are
in
t
he
hand
of
no
man
knoweth
either
love
or
hatred
by
all
that
is
before
Eccl9:2
All
things
come
alike
to
there
is
one
event
to
the
and
to
the
to
the
good
and
to
the
and
to
the
to
him
that
sacrificeth,
and
to
him
that
sacrificeth
as
is
the
so
is
the
and
he
that
sweareth,
as
h
e
that
feareth
an
Eccl9:3
This
is
an
evil
among
all
things
that
are
done
under
the
that
there
is
one
event
unto
also
the
heart
of
the
sons
of
men
is
full
of
and
madness
is
in
their
heart
while
they
and
after
that
they
go
to
the
Eccl9:4
For
to
him
that
is
joined
to
all
the
living
there
is
for
a
living
dog
is
better
than
a
dead
Eccl9:5
For
the
living
know
that
they
shall
but
the
dead
know
not
any
neither
have
they
any
more
a
for
the
memo
ry
of
them
is
Eccl9:6
Also
their
and
their
and
their
is
now
neither
have
they
any
more
a
portion
for
ever
in
any
th
ing
that
is
done
under
the
Eccl9:7
Go
thy
eat
thy
bread
with
and
drink
thy
wine
with
a
merry
for
God
now
accepteth
thy
Eccl9:8
Let
thy
garments
be
always
and
let
thy
head
lack
no
Eccl9:9
Live
joyfully
with
the
wife
whom
thou
lovest
all
the
days
of
the
life
of
thy
which
he
hath
given
thee
under
the
sun
,
all
the
days
of
thy
for
that
is
thy
portion
in
this
and
in
thy
labour
which
thou
takest
under
the
Eccl9:10
Whatsoever
thy
hand
findeth
to
do
it
with
thy
for
there
is
no
nor
nor
nor
in
t
he
whither
thou
goest.
Eccl9:11
I
and
saw
under
the
that
the
race
is
not
to
the
nor
the
battle
to
the
neither
yet
bread
to
t
he
nor
yet
riches
to
men
of
nor
yet
favour
to
men
of
but
time
and
chance
happeneth
to
them
Eccl9:12
For
man
also
knoweth
not
his
as
the
fishes
that
are
taken
in
an
evil
and
as
the
birds
that
are
caught
in
the
sn
so
are
the
sons
of
men
snared
in
an
evil
when
it
falleth
suddenly
upon
Eccl9:13
This
wisdom
have
I
seen
also
under
the
and
it
seemed
great
unto
Eccl9:14
There
was
a
little
and
few
men
within
and
there
came
a
great
king
against
and
besieged
and
built
great
b
ulwarks
against
Eccl9:15
Now
there
was
found
in
it
a
poor
wise
and
he
by
his
wisdom
delivered
the
yet
no
man
remembered
that
same
poor
m
Eccl9:16
Then

The

quiet
more
than
the

Wisdom
is
better

I

Surely

The
words
of

the

The

because

gave

The

For

For

Isa37:5
So
the

Isaiah
said

Isa37:12
Have

laid
waste

And

Isaiah
the

Which
I
commanded
your

that
I
brought

forth
out

saying

Yet
they
obeyed

If

Then

Jeremiah
from

out

Then
said
Jeremiah

For
thus
saith

captive
into

shall
slay
them

Moreover
I

all

And
Pashur,

For

The

Therefore
thus
saith
the
LORD

Because

And
I

I
have
pronounced

written
in
this
wh

Jeremiah
hath
prophesied
against

For

this

So
the
priests
and
the
prophets
and
all
the
people
heard
Jeremiah
speaking
these
words
in
the
house
of
the
Jer26:8
Now
it
came
to
when
Jeremiah
had
made
an
end
of

had
commanded

all
the
people
were
gathered
against
Jeremiah
in
the
house
of
the
Jer26:10
When
the
princes
of
Judah
heard
these
then
they
came
up
from
the
king's
house
unto
the
house
of
the
and
sat
down
in
the
entry
of
the
new
gate
of
the
LORD's
Jer26:11
Then
spake
the
priests
and
the
prophets
unto
the
princes
and
to
all
the
This
man

worthy

he
hath
prophesied

Then
spake
Jeremiah
unto

the
princes

to

Therefore

LORD
hath
sent
me
unto

to

words
in

Jer26:16
Then
said
the
princes
and
all
the
people
unto
the
priests
and
to

This
man
is
not
worthy

he
hath
spoken
to

in
the
name

Jer26:17
Then
rose
up
certain
of
the
elders
of
the
and
spake
to
all
the
assembly
of
the
Jer26:18
Micah
the
Morasthite
prophesied
in
the
days
of
Hezekiah
king
of

spake
to
all
the
people

Hezekiah
king

all

he
not
fear

and
besought
the
and
the
LORD
repented
him
of
the
evil
which
he
had
pronounced
against
Thus
might
we
procure
great
evil
against
our
Jer26:20
And
there
was
also
a
man
that
prophesied
in
the
name
of
the
Urijah
the
son
of
Shemaiah
of
Kirjathjearim,
who
prophes

against
this
city
and
against
this
land
according
to
all
the
words
of
Jer26:21
And
when
Jehoiakim
the
with
all
his
mighty
and
all
the
heard
his
the
king
sought
to
put
him
to
but
when
Urijah
heard
he
was
and
and
went
into
Jer26:22
And
Jehoiakim
the
king
sent
men
into
Elnathan
the
son
of
Achbor,
and
certain
men
with
him
into
Jer26:23
And
they
fetched
forth
Urijah
out
of

brought
him
unto
Jehoiakim
the
who
slew
him
with
the
and
cast
his
dead
body
into
the
graves
of
the
common
Jer26:24
Nevertheless
the
hand
of
Ahikam
the
son
of
Shaphan
was
with
that
they
should
not
give
him
into
the
hand
of
the
p

to
put
him
to
Jer27:1
In
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
Jehoiakim
the
son
of
Josiah
king
of
Judah
came
this
word
unto
Jeremiah
from
the

Thus
saith
the

to

Zidon,
by
the
hand
of
the
messengers
which
come
to
Jerusalem
unto
Zedekiah
king
of

And

my
great
power

by
my
outstretched

given
it
unto

it
seemed

unto
Jer27:6
And
now
have
I
given
all
these
lands
into
the
hand
of
Nebuchadnezzar
the
king
of
my

the
beasts
of

I
given

And

And
it
shall
come

will
not

Nebuchadnezzar
the
king
of

to
your
which

a

you
far
from

But
the
nations

I
spake
also
to
Zedekiah
king
of
Judah
according
to
all
these
Bring

as
the
LORD
hath
spoken
against

Therefore
hearken

words
of

prophets
that
speak

Ye

the
Hearken

words
of
your
prophets
that

Hearken

wherefore
should
this

be
laid

But
if
they
be

if
the
word
of
the
LORD
be

them
now
make
intercession
to
the
LORD
of

in

For
thus
saith
the
LORD
of

concerning

concerning

concerning
the
residue
of
the
vessels
that

Jer27:20
Which
Nebuchadnezzar
king
of
Babylon
took
when
he
carried
away
captive
Jeconiah

son
of
Jehoiakim
king
of
Judah
fr

Jerusalem
to
and
all

day
that

then
will
I
bri

them
and
restore
them
to

Jer28:1
And
it
came
to
pass
the
same
in
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
Zedekiah
king
of
in
the
fourth
and
in
the
fifth
that
Hananiah
the
son
of
Azur
the
which
was
of
spake
unto
me
in
the
house
of
the
in
the
presenc

of
the
priests
and
of
all
the
Jer28:2
Thus
speaketh
the
LORD
of
the
God
of
I
have
broken
the
yoke
of
the
king
of
Jer28:3
Within
two
full
years
will
I
bring
again
into
this
place
all
the
vessels
of
the
LORD's
that
Nebuchadnezzar
king
of
B
abylon
took
away
from
this
and
carried
them
to
Jer28:4
And
I
will
bring
again
to
this
place
Jeconiah
the
son
of
Jehoiakim
king
of
with
all
the
captives
of
that
went
into
saith
the
for
I
will
break
the
yoke
of
the
king
of
Jer28:5
Then
the
prophet
Jeremiah
said
unto
the
prophet
Hananiah
in
the
presence
of
the
and
in
the
presence
of
all
the
peo
ple
that
stood
in
the
house
of
the
Jer28:6
Even
the
prophet
Jeremiah
the
LORD
do
the
LORD
perform
thy
words
which
thou
hast
to
bring
again
the
vessels
of
the
LORD's
and
all
that
is
carried
away
from
Babylon
into
this
Jer28:7
Nevertheless
hear
thou
now
this
word
that
I
speak
in
thine
and
in
the
ears
of
all
the
Jer28:8
The
prophets
that
have
been
before
me
and
before
thee
of
old
prophesied
both
against
many
and
against
great
king
doms,
of
and
of
and
of
Jer28:9
The
prophet
which
prophesieth
of
when
the
word
of
the
prophet
shall
come
to
then
shall
the
prophet
be
t
hat
the
LORD
hath
truly
sent
Jer28:10
Then
Hananiah
the
prophet
took
the
yoke
from
off
the
prophet
Jeremiah's
and
brake
Jer28:11
And
Hananiah
spake
in
the
presence
of
all
the
Thus
saith
the
Even
so
will
I
break
the
yoke
of
Nebuch
adnezzar
king
of
Babylon
from
the
neck
of
all
nations
within
the
space
of
two
full
And
the
prophet
Jeremiah
went
his
Jer28:12
Then
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
Jeremiah
the
after
that
Hananiah
the
prophet
had
broken
the
yoke
from
off
the
neck
of
the
prophet
Jer28:13
Go
and
tell
Hananiah,
Thus
saith
the
Thou
hast
broken
the
yokes
of
but
thou
shalt
make
for
them
yokes
of
Jer28:14
For
thus
saith
the
LORD
of
the
God
of
I
have
put
a
yoke
of
iron
upon
the
neck
of
all
these
that
th
ey
may
serve
Nebuchadnezzar
king
of
and
they
shall
serve
and
I
have
given
him
the
beasts
of
the
field
Jer28:15
Then
said
the
prophet
Jeremiah
unto
Hananiah
the
Hear
Hananiah;
The
LORD
hath
not
sent
but
thou
makest
this
people
to
trust
in
a
Jer28:16
Therefore
thus
saith
the
I
will
cast
thee
from
off
the
face
of
the
this
year
thou
shalt
because
thou
hast
taught
rebellion
against
the
Jer28:17
So
Hananiah
the
prophet
died
the
same
year
in
the
seventh
Jer29:1
Now
these
are
the
words
of
the
letter
that
Jeremiah
the
prophet
sent
from
Jerusalem
unto
the
residue
of
the
elders
which
we
re
carried
away

Nebuchadnezzar
had
carried

(After
that

according
to
the
law
and
and
that
which
was
ope
n:
Jer32:12
And
I
gave
the
evidence
of
the
purchase
unto
Baruch
the
son
of
Neriah,
the
son
of
Maaseiah,
in
the
sight
of
Hanameel
mine
uncle's
and
in
the
presence
of
the
witnesses
that
subscribed
the
book
of
the
before
all
the
Jews
that
sat
in
the
cou
rt
of
the
Jer32:13
And
I
charged
Baruch
before
Jer32:14
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
the
God
of
Take
these
this
evidence
of
the
both
which
is
sealed
,
and
this
evidence
which
is
and
put
them
in
an
earthen
that
they
may
continue
many
Jer32:15
For
thus
saith
the
LORD
of
the
God
of
Houses
and
fields
and
vineyards
shall
be
possessed
again
in
this
land
.
Jer32:16
Now
when
I
had
delivered
the
evidence
of
the
purchase
unto
Baruch
the
son
of
Neriah,
I
prayed
unto
the
Jer32:17
Ah
Lord
thou
hast
made
the
heaven
and
the
earth
by
thy
great
power
and
stretched
out
and
there
is
nothin
g
too
hard
for
Jer32:18
Thou
shewest
lovingkindness
unto
and
recompensest
the
iniquity
of
the
fathers
into
the
bosom
of
their
children
after
the
the
Mighty
the
LORD
of
is
his
Jer32:19
Great
in
and
mighty
in
for
thine
eyes
are
open
upon
all
the
ways
of
the
sons
of
to
give
every
one
acco

to
his
and
according
to
the
fruit
of
his
Jer32:20
Which
hast
set
signs
and
wonders
in
the
land
of
even
unto
this
and
in
and
among
other
and
hast
ma
de
thee
a
as
at
this
Jer32:21
And
hast
brought
forth
thy
people
Israel
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
with
and
with
and
with
a
strong
an
d
with
a
stretched
out
and
with
great
Jer32:22
And
hast
given
them
this
which
thou
didst
swear
to
their
fathers
to
give
a
land
flowing
with
milk
and
Jer32:23
And
they
came
and
possessed
but
they
obeyed
not
thy
neither
walked
in
thy
they
have
done
nothing
of
al
l
that
thou
commandedst
them
to
therefore
thou
hast
caused
all
this
evil
to
come
upon
Jer32:24
Behold
the
they
are
come
unto
the
city
to
take
and
the
city
is
given
into
the
hand
of
the
Chaldeans,
that
figh

against
because
of
the
and
of
the
and
of
the
and
what
thou
hast
spoken
is
come
to
behol

thou
seest
Jer32:25
And
thou
hast
said
unto
O
Lord
Buy
thee
the
field
for
and
take
for
the
city

given
into
the
h
and
of
the
Chaldeans.
Jer32:26
Then
came
the
word
of
the
LORD
unto
Jer32:27
I
am
the
the
God
of
all
is
there
any
thing
too
hard
for
Jer32:28
Therefore
thus
saith
the
I
will
give
this
city
into
the
hand
of
the
Chaldeans,
and
into
the
hand
of
Nebuchad
rezzar
king
of
and
he
shall
take
Jer32:29
And
the
Chaldeans,
that
fight
against
this
shall
come
and
set
fire
on
this
and
burn
it
with
the
upon
w
hose
roofs
they
have
offered
incense
unto
and
poured
out
drink
offerings
unto
other
to
provoke
me
to
Jer32:30
For
the
children
of
Israel
and
the
children
of
Judah
have
only
done
evil
before
me
from
their
for
the
children
of
I
srael
have
only
provoked
me
to
anger
with
the
work
of
their
saith
the
Jer32:31
For
this
city
hath
been
to
me
as
a
provocation
of
mine
anger
and
of
my
fury
from
the
day
that
they
built
it
even
unto
this
that
I
should
remove
it
from
before
my
Jer32:32
Because
of
all
the
evil
of
the
children
of
Israel
and
of
the
children
of
which
they
have
done
to
provoke
me
to
ange
r,
their
their
their
and
their
and
the
men
of
and
the
inhabitants
of
Jer32:33
And
they
have
turned
unto
me
the
and
not
the
though
I
taught
rising
up
early
and
teaching
yet
they
have
not
hearkened
to
receive
Jer32:34
But
they
set
their
abominations
in
the
which
is
called
by
my
to
defile
Jer32:35
And
they
built
the
high
places
of
which
are
in
the
valley
of
the
son
of
Hinnom,
to
cause
their
sons
and
their
daught
ers
to
pass
through
the
fire
unto
which
I
commanded
them
neither
came
it
into
my
that
they
should
do
this
abomin
ation,
to
cause
Judah
to
Jer32:36
And
now
therefore
thus
saith
the
the
God
of
concerning
this
whereof
ye
It
shall
be
delivered
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Babylon
by
the
and
by
the
and
by
the
Jer32:37
I
will
gather
them
out
of
all
whither
I
have
driven
them
in
mine
and
in
my
and
in
great
wr
ath;
and
I
will
bring
them
again
unto
this
and
I
will
cause
them
to
dwell
Jer32:38
And
they
shall
be
my
and
I
will
be
their
Jer32:39
And
I
will
give
them
one
and
one
that
they
may
fear
me
for
for
the
good
of
and
of
their
children
a
fter
Jer32:40
And
I
will
make
an
everlasting
covenant
with
that
I
will
not
turn
away
from
to
do
them
but
I
will
put
my
fear
in
their
that
they
shall
not
depart
from
Jer32:41
I
will
rejoice
over
them
to
do
them
and
I
will
plant
them
in
this
land
assuredly
with
my
whole
heart
and
with
m
y
whole
Jer32:42
For
thus
saith
the
Like
as
I
have
brought
all
this
great
evil
upon
this
so
will
I
bring
upon
them
all
the
go
od
that
I
have
promised
Jer32:43
And
fields
shall
be
bought
in
this
whereof
ye
It
is
desolate
without
man
or
it
is
given
into
the
hand
of
the
Chaldeans.
Jer32:44
Men
shall
buy
fields
for
and
subscribe
and
seal
and
take
witnesses
in
the
land
of

in

cities
of

and
i
n
the
cities
of
the

I
will
cause
their
captivity
to

the
Jer33:1
Moreover
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
Jeremiah
the
second
while
he
was
yet
shut
up
in
the
court
of
the
sayi

Jer33:2
Thus
saith
the
LORD
the
maker

Call
unto
and
I
will
answer
and
shew
thee
great
and
mighty
which
thou
knowest
Jer33:4
For
thus
saith
the
the
God
of
concerning
the
houses
of
this
and
concerning
the
houses
of
the
kings
of
J
udah,
which
are
thrown
down
by
the
and
by
the
Jer33:5
They
come
to
fight
with
the
Chaldeans,
but
it
is
to
fill
them
with
the
dead
bodies
of
whom
I
have
slain
in
mine
anger
and
in
my
and
for
all
whose
wickedness
I
have
hid
my
face
from
this
Jer33:6
I
will
bring
it
health
and
and
I
will
cure
and
will
reveal
unto
them
the
abundance
of
peace
and
Jer33:7
And
I
will
cause
the
captivity
of
Judah
and
the
captivity
of
Israel
to
and
will
build
as
at
the
Jer33:8
And
I
will
cleanse
them
from
all
their
whereby
they
have
sinned
against
and
I
will
pardon
all
their
iniquitie
s,
whereby
they
have
and
whereby
they
have
transgressed
against
Jer33:9
And
it
shall
be
to
me
a
name
of
a
praise
and
an
honour
before
all
the
nations
of
the
which
shall
hear

I
have
promised
unto
the
house
of
Israel
and
to

house
of

In

I
cause
the
Branch
of

For
thus
saith
the
David
shall
never
want
a
man
to
sit
upon
the
throne
of
the
house
of
Jer33:18
Neither
shall
the
priests
the
Levites
want
a
man
before
me
to
offer
burnt
and
to
kindle
meat
and
to
do
sacrifice
Jer33:19
And
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
Jer33:20
Thus
saith
the
If
ye
can
break
my
covenant
of
the
and
my
covenant
of
the
and
that
there
should
not
be

in

Jer33:21
Then
may
also
my
covenant
be
broken
with
David
my
that
he
should
not
have
a
son
to
reign
upon

the
Levites

Jer33:22
As
the
host
of

cannot
be
neither

so
will
I
multiply
the
seed
of
David
my
se

and
the
Levites
that
minister
unto
Jer33:23
Moreover
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
to
Jer33:24
Considerest
thou
not
what
this
people
have
The
two
families
which
the
LORD
hath
he
hath
even
cast
them
thus
they
have
despised
my
that
they
should

no
more

Thus
saith
the
If

and
if
I

Jer33:26
Then
will
I
cast
away

so
that
I
will
not
take
any
of
his
seed
to

Jer34:1
The
word
which
came
unto
Jeremiah
from
the
when
Nebuchadnezzar
king
of
and
all
his
and
all
the
kingdom
s
of
the
earth
of
his
and
all
the
fought
against
and
against
all
the
cities
Jer34:2
Thus
saith
the
the
God
of
Go
and
speak
to
Zedekiah
king
of
and
tell
Thus
saith
the
I
will
give
this
city
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
and
he
shall
burn
it
with
Jer34:3
And
thou
shalt
not
escape
out
of
his
but
shalt
surely
be
and
delivered
into
his
and
thine
eyes
shall
beh
old
the
eyes
of
the
king
of
and
he
shall
speak
with
thee
mouth
to
and
thou
shalt
go
to
Jer34:4
Yet
hear
the
word
of
the
O
Zedekiah
king
of
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
Thou
shalt
not
die
by
the
Jer34:5
But
thou
shalt
die
in
and
with
the
burnings
of
thy
the
former
kings
which
were
before
so
shall
they
b
urn
odours
for
and
they
will
lament
Ah
for
I
have
pronounced
the
saith
the
Jer34:6
Then
Jeremiah
the
prophet
spake
all
these
words
unto
Zedekiah
king
of
Judah
in
Jer34:7
When
the
king
of
Babylon's
army
fought
against
and
against
all
the
cities
of
Judah
that
were
against
Lachi
sh,
and
against
Azekah:
for
these
defenced
cities
remained
of
the
cities
of
Jer34:8
This
is
the
word
that
came
unto
Jeremiah
from
the
after
that
the
king
Zedekiah
had
made
a
covenant
with
all
the
peopl
e
which
were
at
to
proclaim
liberty
unto
Jer34:9
That
every
man
should
let
his
and
every
man
his
being
an
Hebrew
or
an
Hebrewess,
go
that
non
e
should
serve
himself
of
to
of
a
Jew
his
Jer34:10
Now
when
all
the
and
all
the
which
had
entered
into
the
heard
that
every
one
should
let
his
man
and
every
one
his
go
that
none
should
serve
themselves
of
them
any
then
they
and
let
them
Jer34:11
But
afterward
they
and
caused
the
servants
and
the
handmaids,
whom
they
had
let
go
to
and
brought
th
em
into
subjection
for
servants
and
for
handmaids.
Jer34:12
Therefore
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
to
Jeremiah
from
the
Jer34:13
Thus
saith
the
the
God
of
I
made
a
covenant
with
your
fathers
in
the
day
that
I
brought
them
forth
out
of
th
e
land
of
out
of
the
house
of
bondmen,
Jer34:14
At
the
end
of
seven
years
let
ye
go
every
man
his
brother
an
which
hath
been
sold
unto
and
when
he
hath
serv
ed
thee
six
thou
shalt
let
him
go
free
from
but
your
fathers
hearkened
not
unto
neither
inclined
their
Jer34:15
And
ye
were
now
and
had
done
right
in
my
in
proclaiming
liberty
every
man
to
his
and
ye
had
made
a
covenant
before
me
in
the
house
which
is
called
by
my
Jer34:16
But
ye
turned
and
polluted
my
and
caused
every
man
his
and
every
man
his
whom
he
had
set
at
liber
ty
at
their
to
and
brought
them
into
to
be
unto
you
for
servants
and
for
handmaids.
Jer34:17
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Ye
have
not
hearkened
unto
in
proclaiming
every
one
to
his
and
every
man
to
his
I
proclaim
a
liberty
for
saith
the
to
the
to
the
and
to
the
and
I
will
make
you
to
be
removed
into
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
Jer34:18
And
I
will
give
the
men
that
have
transgressed
my
which
have
not
performed
the
words
of
the
covenant
which
they
had
made
before
when
they
cut
the
calf
in
and
passed
between
the
parts

princes
of

of
the
and
the
and
all
the
people
of
the
which
pa

between
the
parts
of
the
Jer34:20
I
will
even
give
them
into
the
hand
of
their
and
into
the
hand
of
them
that
seek
their

their
dead

meat
unto

of
the
and
to
the
beasts
of

And
Zedekiah
king
of
Judah
and
his
princes
will
I
give
into
the
hand
of
their

into
the
hand

that
seek

into
the
hand
of
the
king

are
gone
up
from

the
and
cause
them
to
return
to
this
and
they
shall
fight
against

take

days

one
of
the
chambe
rs,
and
give
them
wine
to
Jer35:3
Then
I
took
Jaazaniah
the
son
of
the
son
of
Habaziniah,
and
his
and
all
his
and
the
whole
house
o
f
the
Rechabites;
Jer35:4
And
I
brought
them
into
the
house
of
the
into
the
chamber
of
the
sons
of
Hanan,
the
son
of
Igdaliah,
a
man
of
wh
ich
was
by
the
chamber
of
the
which
was
above
the
chamber
of
Maaseiah
the
son
of
Shallum,
the
keeper
of
the
Jer35:5
And
I
set
before
the
sons
of
the
house
of
the
Rechabites
pots
full
of
and
and
I
said
unto
Drink
ye
Jer35:6
But
they
We
will
drink
no
for
Jonadab
the
son
of
Rechab
our
father
commanded
Ye
shall
drink
no
wine
,
neither
nor
your
sons
for
Jer35:7
Neither
shall
ye
build
nor
sow
nor
plant
nor
have
but
all
your
days
ye
shall
dwell
in
th
at
ye
may
live
many
days
in
the
land
where
ye
be
Jer35:8
Thus
have
we
obeyed
the
voice
of
Jonadab
the
son
of
Rechab
our
father
in
all
that
he
hath
charged
to
drink
no
wine
all
our
our
our
nor
our
Jer35:9
Nor
to
build
houses
for
us
to
dwell
neither
have
we
nor
nor
Jer35:10
But
we
have
dwelt
in
and
have
and
done
according
to
all
that
Jonadab
our
father
commanded
Jer35:11
But
it
came
to
when
Nebuchadrezzar
king
of
Babylon
came
up
into
the
that
we
and
let
us
go
to
Jerus
alem
for
fear
of
the
army
of
the
Chaldeans,
and
for
fear
of
the
army
of
the
so
we
dwell
at
Jer35:12
Then
came
the
word
of
the
LORD
unto
Jer35:13
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
the
God
of
Go
and
tell
the
men
of
Judah
and
the
inhabitants
of
Will
ye
no
t
receive
instruction
to
hearken
to
my
saith
the
Jer35:14
The
words
of
Jonadab
the
son
of
Rechab,
that
he
commanded
his
sons
not
to
drink
are
for
unto
this
day
the
y
drink
but
obey
their
father's
notwithstanding
I
have
spoken
unto
rising
early
and
but
ye
hearke
ned
not
unto
Jer35:15
I
have
sent
also
unto
you
all
my
servants
the
rising
up
early
and
sending
Return
ye
now
every
man
from
his
evil
and
amend
your
and
go
not
after
other
gods
to
serve
and
ye
shall
dwell
in
the
land
which
I
have
gi
ven
to
you
and
to
your
but
ye
have
not
inclined
your
nor
hearkened
unto
Jer35:16
Because
the
sons
of
Jonadab
the
son
of
Rechab
have
performed
the
commandment
of
their
which
he
commanded
but
this
people
hath
not
hearkened
unto
Jer35:17
Therefore
thus
saith
the
LORD
God
of
the
God
of
I
will
bring
upon
Judah
and
upon
all
the
inhabitant
s
of
Jerusalem
all
the
evil
that
I
have
pronounced
against
because
I
have
spoken
unto
but
they
have
not
and
I
ha
ve
called
unto
but
they
have
not
Jer35:18
And
Jeremiah
said
unto
the
house
of
the
Rechabites,
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
the
God
of
Because
ye
have
obeye
d
the
commandment
of
Jonadab
your
and
kept
all
his
and
done
according
unto
all
that
he
hath
commanded
Jer35:19
Therefore
thus
saith
the
LORD
of
the
God
of
Jonadab
the
son
of
Rechab
shall
not
want
a
man
to
stand
before
me
for
Jer36:1
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
fourth
year
of
Jehoiakim
the
son
of
Josiah
king
of
that
this
word
came
unto
Jeremiah
from
the
Jer36:2
Take
thee
a
roll
of
a
and
write
therein
all
the
words
that
I
have
spoken
unto
thee
against
and
against
and
against
all
the
from
the
day
I
spake
unto
from
the
days
of
even
unto
this
Jer36:3
It
may
be
that
the
house
of
Judah
will
hear
all
the
evil
which
I
purpose
to
do
unto
that
they
may
return
every
man
fr
om
his
evil
that
I
may
forgive
their
iniquity
and
their
Jer36:4
Then
Jeremiah
called
Baruch
the
son
of
Neriah:
and
Baruch
wrote
from
the
mouth
of
Jeremiah
all
the
words
of
the
which
he
had
spoken
unto
upon
a
roll
of
a
Jer36:5
And
Jeremiah
commanded
Baruch,
I
am
shut
I
cannot
go
into
the
house
of
the
Jer36:6
Therefore
go
and
read
in
the
which
thou
hast
written
from
my
the
words
of
the
LORD
in
the
ears
of
the
pe
ople
in
the
LORD's
house
upon
the
fasting
and
also
thou
shalt
read
them
in
the
ears
of
all
Judah
that
come
out
of
their
cities
.
Jer36:7
It
may
be
they
will
present
their
supplication
before
the
and
will
return
every
one
from
his
evil
for
great
is
t
he
anger
and
the
fury
that
the
LORD
hath
pronounced
against
this
Jer36:8
And
Baruch
the
son
of
Neriah
did
according
to
all
that
Jeremiah
the
prophet
commanded
reading
in
the
book
the
words
of
the
LORD
in
the
LORD's
Jer36:9
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
fifth
year
of
Jehoiakim
the
son
of
Josiah
king
of
in
the
ninth
that
they
proclaime
d
a
fast
before
the
LORD
to
all
the
people
in
and
to
all
the
people
that
came
from
the
cities
of
Judah
unto
Jer36:10
Then
read
Baruch
in
the
book
the
words
of
Jeremiah
in
the
house
of
the
in
the
chamber
of
Gemariah
the
son
of
Shaphan
the
in
the
higher
at
the
entry
of
the
new
gate
of
the
LORD's
in
the
ears
of
all
the
Jer36:11
When
Michaiah
the
son
of
Gemariah,
the
son
of
Shaphan,
had
heard
out
of
the
book
all
the
words
of
the
Jer36:12
Then
he
went
down
into
the
king's
into
the
scribe's
all
the
princes
sat
even
Elishama
the
and
Delaiah
the
son
of
Shemaiah,
and
Elnathan
the
son
of
Achbor,
and
Gemariah
the
son
of
Shaphan,
and
Zedekiah
the
son
of
H
ananiah,
and
all
the
Jer36:13
Then
Michaiah
declared
unto
them
all
the
words
that
he
had
when
Baruch
read
the
book
in
the
ears
of
the
Jer36:14
Therefore
all
the
princes
sent
Jehudi
the
son
of
Nethaniah,
the
son
of
Shelemiah,
the
son
of
Cushi,
unto
Baruch,
T
ake
in
thine
hand
the
roll
wherein
thou
hast
read
in
the
ears
of
the
and
So
Baruch
the
son
of
Neriah
took
the
roll
in
his
and
came
unto
Jer36:15
And
they
said
unto
Sit
down
and
read
it
in
our
So
Baruch
read
it
in
their
Jer36:16
Now
it
came
to
when
they
had
heard
all
the
they
were
afraid
both
one
and
and
said
unto
Baruch,
We
will
surely
tell
the
king
of
all
these
Jer36:17
And
they
asked
Baruch,
Tell
us
How
didst
thou
write
all
these
words
at
his
Jer36:18
Then
Baruch
answered
He
pronounced
all
these
words
unto
me
with
his
and
I
wrote
them
with
ink
in
the
Jer36:19
Then
said
the
princes
unto
Baruch,
hide
thou
and
and
let
no
man
know
where
ye
Jer36:20
And
they
went
in
to
the
king
into
the
but
they
laid
up
the
roll
in
the
chamber
of
Elishama
the
and
told
all
the
words
in
the
ears
of
the
Jer36:21
So
the
king
sent
Jehudi
to
fetch
the
and
he
took
it
out
of
Elishama
the
scribe's
And
Jehudi
read
it
in
the
ears
of
the
and
in
the
ears
of
all
the
princes
which
stood
beside
the
Jer36:22
Now
the
king
sat
in
the
winterhouse
in
the
ninth
and
there
was
a
fire
on
the
hearth
burning
before
Jer36:23
And
it
came
to
that
when
Jehudi
had
read
three
or
four
he
cut
it
with
the
and
cast
it
into
the
fir
e
that
was
on
the
until
all
the
roll
was
consumed
in
the
fire
that
was
on
the
Jer36:24
Yet
they
were
not
nor
rent
their
neither
the
nor
any
of
his
servants
that
heard
all
these
Jer36:25
Nevertheless
Elnathan
and
Delaiah
and
Gemariah
had
made
intercession
to
the
king
that
he
would
not
burn
the
but
he
w
ould
not
hear
Jer36:26
But
the
king
commanded
Jerahmeel
the
son
of
Hammelech,
and
Seraiah
the
son
of
Azriel,
and
Shelemiah
the
son
of
Abdeel,
to
take
Baruch
the
scribe
and
Jeremiah
the
but
the
LORD
hid
Jer36:27
Then
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
to
after
that
the
king
had
burned
the
and
the
words
which
Baruch
wrote
at
t
he
mouth
of
Jer36:28
Take
thee
again
another
and
write
in
it
all
the
former
words
that
were
in
the
first
which
Jehoiakim

And
thou

saith
the

and
b
Jer36:30
Therefore
thus
saith
the
LORD
of
Jehoiakim
king
of
He
shall
have
none
to
sit
upon
the
throne
of
and
his
dead
body
shall
be
cast
out
in
the
day
to
the
and
in
the
night
to
the
Jer36:31
And
I
will
punish
him
and
his
seed
and
his
servants
for
their
and
I
will
bring
upon
and
upon
the
inhabitan
ts
of
and
upon
the
men
of
all
the
evil
that
I
have
pronounced
against
but
they
hearkened
Jer36:32
Then
took
Jeremiah
another
and
gave
it
to
Baruch
the
the
son
of
Neriah;
who
wrote
therein
from
the
mouth
of
Jeremiah
all
the
words
of
the
book
which
Jehoiakim
king
of
Judah
had
burned
in
the
and
there
were
added
besides
unto
them
man
y
like
Jer37:1
And
king
Zedekiah
the
son
of
Josiah
reigned
instead
of
Coniah
the
son
of
Jehoiakim,
whom
Nebuchadrezzar
king
of
Babylon
mad
e
king
in
the
land
of
Jer37:2
But
neither
nor
his
nor
the
people
of
the
did
hearken
unto
the
words
of
the
which
he
spake
by
the
prophet
Jer37:3
And
Zedekiah
the
king
sent
Jehucal
the
son
of
Shelemiah
and
Zephaniah
the
son
of
Maaseiah
the
priest
to
the
prophet
Jeremia
h,
Pray
now
unto
the
LORD
our
God
for
Jer37:4
Now
Jeremiah
came
in
and
went
out
among
the
for
they
had
not
put
him
into
Jer37:5
Then
Pharaoh's
army
was
come
forth
out
of
and
when
the
Chaldeans
that
besieged
Jerusalem
heard
tidings
of
they
departed
from
Jer37:6
Then
came
the
word
of
the
LORD
unto
the
prophet
Jer37:7
Thus
saith
the
the
God
of
Thus
shall
ye
say
to
the
king
of
that
sent
you
unto
me
to
enquire
of
Beh
Pharaoh's
which
is
come
forth
to
help
shall
return
to
Egypt
into
their
own
Jer37:8
And
the
Chaldeans
shall
come
and
fight
against
this
and
take
and
burn
it
with
Jer37:9
Thus
saith
the
Deceive
not
The
Chaldeans
shall
surely
depart
from
for
they
shall
not
Jer37:10
For
though
ye
had
smitten
the
whole
army
of
the
Chaldeans
that
fight
against
and
there
remained
but
wounded
men
among
yet
should
they
rise
up
every
man
in
his
and
burn
this
city
with
Jer37:11
And
it
came
to
that
when
the
army
of
the
Chaldeans
was
broken
up
from
Jerusalem
for
fear
of
Pharaoh's
Jer37:12
Then
Jeremiah
went
forth
out
of
Jerusalem
to
go
into
the
land
of
to
separate
himself
thence
in
the
midst
of
the
Jer37:13
And
when
he
was
in
the
gate
of
a
captain
of
the
ward
was
whose
name
was
Irijah,
the
son
of
Shelemiah,
the
son
of
Hananiah;
and
he
took
Jeremiah
the
Thou
fallest
away
to
the
Chaldeans.
Jer37:14
Then
said
It
is
I
fall
not
away
to
the
Chaldeans.
But
he
hearkened
not
to
so
Irijah
took
a
nd
brought
him
to
the
Jer37:15
Wherefore
the
princes
were
wroth
with
and
smote
and
put
him
in
prison
in
the
house
of
Jonathan
the
for
they
had
made
that
the
Jer37:16
When
Jeremiah
was
entered
into
the
and
into
the
and
Jeremiah
had
remained
there
many
Jer37:17
Then
Zedekiah
the
king
and
took
him
and
the
king
asked
him
secretly
in
his
and
Is
there
any
word
f
rom
the
And
Jeremiah
There
said
thou
shalt
be
delivered
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Jer37:18
Moreover
Jeremiah
said
unto
king
What
have
I
offended
against
or
against
thy
or
against
this
peo
ple,
that
ye
have
put
me
in
Jer37:19
Where
are
now
your
prophets
which
prophesied
unto
The
king
of
Babylon
shall
not
come
against
nor
against
this
Jer37:20
Therefore
hear
I
pray
O
my
lord
the
let
my
I
pray
be
accepted
before
that
thou
cause
me
not
to
return
to
the
house
of
Jonathan
the
lest
I
die
Jer37:21
Then
Zedekiah
the
king
commanded
that
they
should
commit
Jeremiah
into
the
court
of
the
and
that
they
should
give
him
daily
a
piece
of
bread
out
of
the
until
all
the
bread
in
the
city
were
Thus
Jeremiah
remained
in
the
cou
rt
of
the
Jer38:1
Then
Shephatiah
the
son
of
Mattan,
and
Gedaliah
the
son
of
Pashur,
and
Jucal
the
son
of
Shelemiah,
and
Pashur
the
son
of
Ma
lchiah,
heard
the
words
that
Jeremiah
had
spoken
unto
all
the
Jer38:2
Thus
saith
the
He
that
remaineth
in
this
city
shall
die
by
the
by
the
and
by

but
he
th
at
goeth
forth
to
the
Chaldeans
shall
for
he
shall
have
his
life
for
a
and
shall
Jer38:3
Thus
saith
the
This
city
shall
surely
be
given
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Babylon's
which
shall
take
Jer38:4
Therefore
the
princes
said
unto
the
We
beseech
let
this
man
be
put
to
for
thus
he
weakeneth
the
hands
of
the
men
of
war
that
remain
in
this
and
the
hands
of
all
the
in
speaking
such
words
unto
for
this
man
seeketh
n
ot
the
welfare
of
this
but
the
Jer38:5
Then
Zedekiah
the
king
he
is
in
your
for
the
king
is
not
he
that
can
do
any
thing
against
Jer38:6
Then
took
they
and
cast
him
into
the
dungeon
of
Malchiah
the
son
of
Hammelech,
that
was
in
the
court
of
the
priso
n:
and
they
let
down
Jeremiah
with
And
in
the
dungeon
there
was
no
but
so
Jeremiah
sunk
in
the
Jer38:7
Now
when
Ebedmelech
the
one
of
the
eunuchs
which
was
in
the
king's
heard
that
they
had
put
Jeremiah
in
th
e
the
king
then
sitting
in
the
gate
of
Jer38:8
Ebedmelech
went
forth
out
of
the
king's
and
spake
to
the
Jer38:9
My
lord
the
these
men
have
done
evil
in
all
that
they
have
done
to
Jeremiah
the
whom
they
have
cast
into
the
and
he
is
like
to
die
for
hunger
in
the
place
where
he
for
there
is
no
more
bread
in
the
Jer38:10
Then
the
king
commanded
Ebedmelech
the
Take
from
hence
thirty
men
with
and
take
up
Jeremiah
the
p
rophet
out
of
the
before
he
Jer38:11
So
Ebedmelech
took
the
men
with
and
went
into
the
house
of
the
king
under
the
and
took
thence
old
cast
clou
ts
and
old
rotten
and
let
them
down
by
cords

Then
Jeremiah

if

So
Zedekiah

And
Zedekiah
the

said

lest
they
deliver

But
Jeremiah
They

Then
said
Zedekiah
unto
Let

But
if
the

they
come

So

Moreover
he
put

And
the
Chaldeans
burned
the

Now
Nebuchadrezzar

Now
it

And
it
came
to

found

Now
it

Because

obey
the
voice
of
the
LORD
our
to
whom
we
send
that
it
may
be
well
with
when
we
obey
the
voice
of
the
LORD
our
Jer42:7
And
it
came
to
pass
after
ten
that
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
Jer42:8
Then
called
he
Johanan
the
son
of
Kareah,
and
all
the
captains
of
the
forces
which
were
with
and
all
the
people
from
t
he
least
even
to
the
Jer42:9
And
said
unto
Thus
saith
the
the
God
of
unto
whom
ye
sent
me
to
present
your
supplication
before
Jer42:10
If
ye
will
still
abide
in
this
then
will
I
build
and
not
pull
you
and
I
will
plant
and
not
pluck
you
for
I
repent
me
of
the
evil
that
I
have
done
unto
Jer42:11
Be
not
afraid
of
the
king
of
of
whom
ye
are
be
not
afraid
of
saith
the
for
I
am
with
you
to
sa
ve
and
to
deliver
you
from
his
Jer42:12
And
I
will
shew
mercies
unto
that
he
may
have
mercy
upon
and
cause
you
to
return
to
your
own
Jer42:13
But
if
ye
We
will
not
dwell
in
this
neither
obey
the
voice
of
the
LORD
your
Jer42:14
but
we
will
go
into
the
land
of
where
we
shall
see
no
nor
hear
the
sound
of
the
nor
have
hunger
of
and
there
will
we
Jer42:15
And
now
therefore
hear
the
word
of
the
ye
remnant
of
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
the
God
of
If
ye
w
holly
set
your
faces
to
enter
into
and
go
to
sojourn
Jer42:16
Then
it
shall
come
to
that
the
which
ye
shall
overtake
you
there
in
the
land
of
and
the
famine
,
whereof
ye
were
shall
follow
close
after
you
there
in
and
there
ye
shall
Jer42:17
So
shall
it
be
with
all
the
men
that
set
their
faces
to
go
into
Egypt
to
sojourn
they
shall
die
by
the
by
th
e
and
by
the
and
none
of
them
shall
remain
or
escape
from
the
evil
that
I
will
bring
upon
Jer42:18
For
thus
saith
the
LORD
of
the
God
of
As
mine
anger
and
my
fury
hath
been
poured
forth
upon
the
inhabitants
of
so
shall
my
fury
be
poured
forth
upon
when
ye
shall
enter
into
and
ye
shall
be
an
and
an
ast
onishment,
and
a
and
a
and
ye
shall
see
this
place
no
Jer42:19
The
LORD
hath
said
concerning
O
ye
remnant
of
Go
ye
not
into
know
certainly
that
I
have
admonished
you
this
Jer42:20
For
ye
dissembled
in
your
when
ye
sent
me
unto
the
LORD
your
Pray
for
us
unto
the
LORD
our
and
a
ccording
unto
all
that
the
LORD
our
God
shall
so
declare
unto
and
we
will
do
Jer42:21
And
now
I
have
this
day
declared
it
to
but
ye
have
not
obeyed
the
voice
of
the
LORD
your
nor
any
thing
for
the
w
hich
he
hath
sent
me
unto
Jer42:22
Now
therefore
know
certainly
that
ye
shall
die
by
the
by
the
and
by
the
in
the
place
whither
ye
desire
to
go
and
to
Jer43:1
And
it
came
to
that
when
Jeremiah
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
unto
all
the
people
all
the
words
of
the
LORD
their
God
,
for
which
the
LORD
their
God
had
sent
him
to
even
all
these
Jer43:2
Then
spake
Azariah
the
son
of
Hoshaiah,
and
Johanan
the
son
of
Kareah,
and
all
the
proud
saying
unto
Thou
sp
eakest
the
LORD
our
God
hath
not
sent
thee
to
Go
not
into
Egypt
to
sojourn
Jer43:3
But
Baruch
the
son
of
Neriah
setteth
thee
on
against
for
to
deliver
us
into
the
hand
of
the
Chaldeans,
that
they
might
put
us
to
and
carry
us
away
captives
into
Jer43:4
So
Johanan
the
son
of
Kareah,
and
all
the
captains
of
the
and
all
the
obeyed
not
the
voice
of
the
to
dwell
in
the
land
of
Jer43:5
But
Johanan
the
son
of
Kareah,
and
all
the
captains
of
the
took
all
the
remnant
of
that
were
returned
from
a
ll
whither
they
had
been
to
dwell
in
the
land
of
Jer43:6
Even
and
and
and
the
king's
and
every
person
that
Nebuzaradan
the
captain
of
the
guard
had
left
with
Gedaliah
the
son
of
Ahikam
the
son
of
Shaphan,
and
Jeremiah
the
and
Baruch
the
son
of
Neriah.
Jer43:7
So
they
came
into
the
land
of
for
they
obeyed
not
the
voice
of
the
thus
came
they
even
to
Tahpanhes.
Jer43:8
Then
came
the
word
of
the
LORD
unto
Jeremiah
in
Tahpanhes,
Jer43:9
Take
great
stones
in
thine
and
hide
them
in
the
clay
in
the
brickkiln,
which
is
at
the
entry
of
Pharaoh's
house
in
Ta
hpanhes,
in
the
sight
of
the
men
of
Jer43:10
And
say
unto
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
the
God
of
I
will
send
and
take
Nebuchadrezzar
the
king
o
f
my
and
will
set
his
throne
upon
these
stones
that
I
have
and
he
shall
spread
his
royal
pavilion
over
Jer43:11
And
when
he
he
shall
smite
the
land
of
and
deliver
such
as
are
for
death
to
and
such
as
are
for
capt
ivity
to
and
such
as
are
for
the
sword
to
the
Jer43:12
And
I
will
kindle
a
fire
in
the
houses
of
the
gods
of
and
he
shall
burn
and
carry
them
away
and
he
shall
array
himself
with
the
land
of
as
a
shepherd
putteth
on
his
and
he
shall
go
forth
from
thence
in
Jer43:13
He
shall
break
also
the
images
of
Bethshemesh,
that
is
in
the
land
of
and
the
houses
of
the
gods
of
the
Egyptians
s
hall
he
burn
with
Jer44:1
The
word
that
came
to
Jeremiah
concerning
all
the
Jews
which
dwell
in
the
land
of
which
dwell
at
Migdol,
and
at
Tahp
anhes,
and
at
Noph,
and
in
the
country
of
Pathros,
Jer44:2
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
the
God
of
Ye
have
seen
all
the
evil
that
I
have
brought
upon
and
upon
all
the
cities
of
this
day
they
are
a
and
no
man
dwelleth
Jer44:3
Because
of
their
wickedness
which
they
have
committed
to
provoke
me
to
in
that
they
went
to
burn
and
to
ser
ve
other
whom
they
knew
neither
nor
your
Jer44:4
Howbeit
I
sent
unto
you
all
my
servants

rising
early
and

abominable
thi

But
they
hearkened
nor
inclined
their
ear
to
turn
from
their
to
burn
no
incense
unto
other
Jer44:6
Wherefore
my
fury
and
mine
anger
was
poured
and
was
kindled
in
the
cities
of
Judah
and
in
the
streets
of
and
they
are
wasted
and
as
at
this
Jer44:7
Therefore
now
thus
saith
the
the
God
of
the
God
of
Wherefore
commit
ye
this
great
evil
against
your
so

to
cut
off
from
you
man
and
child
and
out
of
to
leave
you
none
to
Jer44:8
In
that
ye
provoke
me
unto
wrath
with
the
works
of
your
burning
incense
unto
other
gods
in
the
land
of
whithe
r
ye
be
gone
to
that
ye
might
cut
yourselves
and
that
ye
might
be
a
curse
and
a
reproach
among
all
the
nations
of
the

Jer44:9
Have
ye
forgotten
the
wickedness
of
your
and
the
wickedness
of
the
kings
of
and
the
wickedness
of
their
wiv
es,
and
your
own
and
the
wickedness
of
your
which
they
have
committed
in
the
land
of
and
in

streets
o

Jer44:10
They
are
not
humbled
even
unto
this
neither
have
they
nor
walked
in
my
nor
in

that
I
set
be

and
before

Therefore
thus
saith
the
LORD
of
the
God
of
I
will
set
my
face
against
you
for
and
to
cut
off
all
Jer44:12
And
I
will
take
the
remnant
of
that
have
set
their
faces
to
go
into
the
land
of
Egypt
to
sojourn
and
they
sh
all

be

fall
in
the
land
of

even
be
consumed
by

and
by

For
I
will
punish
them
that
dwell
in
the
land
of
as
I
have
punished
by
the
by
the
and
by
the
Jer44:14
So
that
none
of
the
remnant
of
which
are
gone
into
the
land
of
Egypt
to
sojourn
shall
escape
or
that
they
should
return
into
the
land
of
to
the
which
they
have
a
desire
to
return

none

Jer44:15
Then
all
the
men
which
knew
that
their
wives
had
burned
incense
unto
other
and
all
the
women
that
stood
a
great
even
all
the
people
that
dwelt
in
the
land
of
in
Pathros,
answered
Jer44:16
As
for
the
word
that
thou
hast
spoken
unto
us
in
the
name
of
the
we
will
not
hearken
unto
Jer44:17
But
we
will
certainly
do
whatsoever
thing
goeth
forth
out
of
our
own
to
burn
incense
unto
the
queen
of
and
to
pour
out
drink
offerings
unto
as
we
have
and
our
our
and
our
in
the
cities
of
and
in
the
streets
of
for
then
had
we
plenty
of
and
were
and
saw
no
Jer44:18
But
since
we
left
off
to
burn
incense
to
the
queen
of
and
to
pour
out
drink
offerings
unto
we
have
wanted
all
and
have
been
consumed
by
the
sword
and
by
the
Jer44:19
And
when
we
burned
incense
to
the
queen
of
and
poured
out
drink
offerings
unto
did
we
make
her
cakes
to
worsh
ip
and
pour
out
drink
offerings
unto
without

Jer44:20
Then
Jeremiah
said
unto
all
the
to
the
and
to
the
and
to
all
the
people
which
had
given
him
that
answe
r,
Jer44:21
The
incense
that
ye
burned
in
the
cities
of
and
in
the
streets
of
and
your
your
and
your
and
the
people
of
the
did
not
the
LORD
remember
and
came
it
not
into
his
Jer44:22
So
that
the
LORD
could
no
longer
because
of
the
evil
of
your
and
because
of
the
abominations
which
ye
have
c
ommitted;
therefore
is
your
land
a
and
an
and
a
without
an
as
at
this
Jer44:23
Because
ye
have
burned
and
because
ye
have
sinned
against
the
and
have
not
obeyed
the
voice
of
the
no
r
walked
in
his
nor
in
his
nor
in
his
therefore
this
evil
is
happened
unto
as
at
this
Jer44:24
Moreover
Jeremiah
said
unto
all
the
and
to
all
the
Hear
the
word
of
the
all
Judah
that
are
in
the
lan
d
of

Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
the
God
of
Ye
and
your
wives
have
both
spoken
with
your
and
fulfille
d
with
your
We
will
surely
perform
our
vows
that
we
have
to
burn
incense
to
the
queen
of
and
to
pour
o
ut
drink
offerings
unto
ye
will
surely
accomplish
your
and
surely
perform
your
Jer44:26
Therefore
hear
ye
the
word
of
the
all
Judah
that
dwell
in
the
land
of
I
have
sworn
by
my
great
saith
the
that
my
name
shall
no
more
be
named
in
the
mouth
of
any
man
of
Judah
in
all
the
land
of
The
Lord
GOD
Jer44:27
I
will
watch
over
them
for
and
not
for
and
all
the
men
of
Judah
that
are
in
the
land
of
Egypt
shall
be
consumed
by
the
sword
and
by
the
until
there
be
an
end
of
Jer44:28
Yet
a
small
number
that
escape
the
sword
shall
return
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
into
the
land
of
and
all
the
remnant
of
that
are
gone
into
the
land
of
Egypt
to
sojourn
shall
know
whose
words
shall
or
Jer44:29
And
this
shall
be
a
sign
unto
saith
the
that
I
will
punish
you
in
this
that
ye
may
know
that
my
words
sh
all
surely
stand
against
you

The
word
which
Jeremiah
the
prophet
commanded
Seraiah
the
son
of
Neriah,
the
son
of
Maaseiah,
when
he
went
with
Zedekiah
t
he
king
of
Judah
into
Babylon
in
the
fourth
year
of
his
And
this
Seraiah
was
a
quiet
Jer51:60
So
Jeremiah
wrote
in
a
book
all
the
evil
that
should
come
upon
even
all
these
words
that
are
written
against
Baby
lon.
Jer51:61
And
Jeremiah
said
to
Seraiah,
When
thou
comest
to
and
shalt
and
shalt
read
all
these
Jer51:62
Then
shalt
thou
O
thou
hast
spoken
against
this
to
cut
it
that
none
shall
remain
in
neither
man
nor
but
that
it
shall
be
desolate
for
Jer51:63
And
it
shall
when
thou
hast
made
an
end
of
reading
this
that
thou
shalt
bind
a
stone
to
and
cast
it
into
the
midst
of
Jer51:64
And
thou
shalt
Thus
shall
Babylon
and
shall
not
rise
from
the
evil
that
I
will
bring
upon
and
they
shall

Thus
far
are
the
words
of
Jer52:1
Zedekiah

twenty
years
old
when

And
he
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
eyes
of

according
to
all
that
Jehoiakim
had
Jer52:3
For
through

it

and
till

had
cast
them
out
from

Zedekiah
rebelled

Then
the

forth
out

by
night
by
the

be

and
they
went

But
the

Chaldeans
pursued
after

all
the

of
Judah
in

Jer52:11
Then
he
put

bound
him
in

put
him
in

Chaldeans
by

hand
of

upon

And
their
feet
were
straight

sole
of
their
feet
was

the
sole
of

calf's
and
they
sparkled
like
the
colour
of

Eze1:8
And
they
had
the
hands
of
a
man
under
their
wings
on
their
four

they
four
had
their

As

And
the
living

ran

Now
as
I
beheld
the

The

the
colour
of

they
four
had
one

their
appearance

their

When

As

were
so

And

were
lifted
up

Whithersoever
the

And
under

were

And
when

And
above
the

that
was
over

was
the
likeness

And

Eze1:28
As
the
appearance
of

And
when
I
saw
I
fell
upon
my
and
I
heard
a
voice
of
on

that
Eze2:1
And
he
said
unto
Son
of
stand
upon
thy
and
I
will
speak
unto
Eze2:2
And
the
spirit
entered
into
me
when
he
spake
unto
and
set
me
upon
my
that
I
heard
him
that
spake
unto
Eze2:3
And
he
said
unto
Son
of
I
send
thee
to
the
children
of
to
a
rebellious
nation
that
hath
rebelled
against
me
:
they
and
their
fathers
have
transgressed
against
even
unto
this
very
Eze2:4
For
they
are
impudent
children
and
stiffhearted.
I
do
send
thee
unto
and
thou
shalt
say
unto
Thus
saith
the
Lord
Eze2:5
And
whether
they
will
or
whether
they
will
(for
they
are
a
rebellious
house,)
yet
shall
know
that
there
hath
been
a
prophet
among
Eze2:6
And
son
of
be
not
afraid
of
neither
be
afraid
of
their
though
briers
and
thorns
be
with
and
th
ou
dost
dwell
among
be
not
afraid
of
their
nor
be
dismayed
at
their
though
they
be
a
rebellious
Eze2:7
And
thou
shalt
speak
my
words
unto
whether
they
will
or
whether
they
will
for
they
are
most
Eze2:8
But
son
of
hear
what
I
say
unto
Be
not
thou
rebellious
like
that
rebellious
open
thy
and
eat
that
I
give
Eze2:9
And
when
I
an
hand
was
sent
unto
a
roll
of
a
book
was
Eze2:10
And
he
spread
it
before
and
it
was
written
within
and
and
there
was
written
therein
and
mourning
,
and
Eze3:1
Moreover
he
said
unto
Son
of
eat
that
thou
findest;
eat
this
and
go
speak
unto
the
house
of
Eze3:2
So
I
opened
my
and
he
caused
me
to
eat
that
Eze3:3
And
he
said
unto
Son
of
cause
thy
belly
to
and
fill
thy
bowels
with
this
roll
that
I
give
Then
did
I
eat
and
it
was
in
my
mouth
as
honey
for
Eze3:4
And
he
said
unto
Son
of
get
thee
unto
the
house
of
and
speak
with
my
words
unto
Eze3:5
For
thou
art
not
sent
to
a
people
of
a
strange
speech
and
of
an
hard
but
to
the
house
of
Eze3:6
Not
to
many
people
of
a
strange
speech
and
of
an
hard
whose
words
thou
canst
not
had
I
sent
th
ee
to
they
would
have
hearkened
unto
Eze3:7
But
the
house
of
Israel
will
not
hearken
unto
for
they
will
not
hearken
unto
for
all
the
house
of
Israel
are
impud
ent
and
Eze3:8
I
have
made
thy
face
strong
against
their
and
thy
forehead
strong
against
their
Eze3:9
As
an
adamant
harder
than
flint
have
I
made
thy
fear
them
neither
be
dismayed
at
their
though
they
be
a
rebellious
Eze3:10
Moreover
he
said
unto
Son
of
all
my
words
that
I
shall
speak
unto
thee
receive
in
thine
and
hear
with
thine
Eze3:11
And
get
thee
to
them
of
the
unto
the
children
of
thy
and
speak
unto
and
tell
Thus
saith
the
Lord
whether
they
will
or
whether
they
will
Eze3:12
Then
the
spirit
took
me
and
I
heard
behind
me
a
voice
of
a
great
Blessed
be
the
glory
of
the
LORD
from
his
Eze3:13
I
heard
also
the
noise
of
the
wings
of
the
living
creatures
that
touched
one
and
the
noise
of
the
wheels
over
agai

and
a
noise
of
a
great
Eze3:14
So
the
spirit
lifted
me
and
took
me
and
I
went
in
in
the
heat
of
my
but
the
hand
of
the
LORD
was
strong
upon
Eze3:15
Then
I
came
to
them
of
the
captivity
at
Telabib,
that
dwelt
by
the
river
of
Chebar,
and
I
sat
where
they
and
remained
there
astonished
among
them
seven
Eze3:16
And
it
came
to
pass
at
the
end
of

word
of

LORD
came
unto

And
the

was
there
upon

he
said
unto

Every

Moreover
the

lifted

Therefore

fell

Ye

multiplied
your

in

ye
have
filled
the
streets
thereof
with

Therefore
thus
saith

And

Then
fell

down
upon

cried
wi

Although

off

although
I

Therefore
Thus
saith

I
will
even
gather

And
I
will
give

will
put

lift

of

God
of

was
over

Eze11:23
And
the
glory
of

Afterwards

of
God
into

had
shewed

The
word
of

And
I

Then
washed
I
thee
with

I
anointed
thee

I
clothed
thee
also
with

thee
with

I
girded
thee
about

I
covered
thee

the
Lord
Eze16:15
But
thou
didst
trust
in
thine

playedst
the
harlot
because
of
thy

pouredst
out
thy
fornications
on
every

And
of

Moreover

And
in
all
thine
abominations
and
thy
whoredoms
thou
hast
not
remembered
the
days
of
thy
when
thou
wast
naked
and
b
and
wast
polluted
in
thy
Eze16:23
And
it
came
to

after
all

woe

the
LORD
GOD;)
Eze16:24
That
thou
hast
also
built
unto
thee
an
eminent

hast
made
thee
an
high
place
in

Thou
hast
built
thy
high
place
at
every
head

hast
made
thy
beauty
to
be

hast
opened
thy
feet
to
every
one
that
passed
and
multiplied
thy
whoredoms.
Eze16:26
Thou
hast
also
committed
fornication
with
the
Egyptians
thy
great
of
and
hast
increased
thy
whoredoms,
to
provoke
me
to
Eze16:27
therefore
I
have
stretched
out
my
hand
over

have
diminished
thine
ordinary

delivered
thee
unto
the
will
of
them
that
hate
the
daughters
of
the
which
are
ashamed
of
thy
lewd
Eze16:28
Thou
hast
played
the
whore
also
with
the
Assyrians,
because
thou
wast
unsatiable;
thou
hast
played
the
harlot
with
th
and
yet
couldest
not

Thou
hast
moreover
multiplied
thy
fornication
in
the
land
of
Canaan
unto

yet
thou
wast
not
satisfied
herewith
.
Eze16:30
How
weak
is
thine
saith
the
LORD
seeing
thou
doest
all
these
the
work
of
an
imperious
whorish
Eze16:31
In
that
thou
buildest
thine
eminent
place
in
the
head
of

makest
thine
high
place
in
every

hast
not
been
as

that
thou
scornest

But
as
a
wife
that
committeth
which
taketh
strangers
instead
of
her
Eze16:33
They
give
gifts
to
all
but
thou
givest
thy
gifts
to
all
thy
and
hirest
that
they
may
come
unto
thee
on
every
side
for
thy
Eze16:34
And
the
contrary
is
in
thee
from
other
women
in
thy
whoredoms,
whereas
none
followeth
thee
to
commit
whoredoms:
and
in
tha

thou
givest
a

no
reward
is
given
unto
therefore
thou
art
Eze16:35
O
hear
the
word
of
the
Eze16:36
Thus
saith
the
Lord
Because
thy
filthiness
was
poured
and
thy
nakedness
discovered
through
thy
whoredoms
with
th
y
and
with
all
the
idols
of
thy
and
by
the
blood
of
thy
which
thou
didst
give
unto
Eze16:37
therefore
I
will
gather
all
thy
with
whom
thou
hast
taken
and
all
them
that
thou
hast
wit
h
all
them
that
thou
hast
I
will
even
gather
them
round
about
against
and
will
discover
thy
nakedness
unto
that
they
may
see
all
thy
Eze16:38
And
I
will
judge
as
women
that
break
wedlock
and
shed
blood
are
and
I
will
give
thee
blood
in
fury
and
jealo
usy.
Eze16:39
And
I
will
also
give
thee
into
their
and
they
shall
throw
down
thine
eminent
and
shall
break
down
thy
high
pl
they
shall
strip
thee
also
of
thy
and
shall
take
thy
fair
and
leave
thee
naked
and
Eze16:40
They
shall
also
bring
up
a
company
against
and
they
shall
stone
thee
with
and
thrust
thee
through
with
their
Eze16:41
And
they
shall
burn
thine
houses
with
and
execute
judgments
upon
thee
in
the
sight
of
many
and
I
will
cause
t
hee
to
cease
from
playing
the
and
thou
also
shalt
give
no
hire
any
Eze16:42
So
will
I
make
my
fury
toward
thee
to
and
my
jealousy
shall
depart
from
and
I
will
be
and
will
be
no
mo
re
Eze16:43
Because
thou
hast
not
remembered
the
days
of
thy
but
hast
fretted
me
in
all
these
therefore
I
also
will
recompense
thy
way
upon
thine

the
Lord
and
thou
shalt
not
commit
this
lewdness
above
all
thine

And
Thus
saith
the
Lord
A
great
eagle
with
great
longwinged,
full
of

had
divers

took
the
highest
branch
of
the
Eze17:4
He
cropped
off
the
top
of
his
young
and
carried
it
into
a
land
of
traffick;
he
set
it
in
a
city
of
Eze17:5
He
took
also
of
the
seed
of
the
and
planted
it
in
a
fruitful
he
placed
it
by
great
and
set
it
as
a

low
Eze17:6
And
it

became
a
spreading
vine
of

whose
branches
turned
toward

the
roots
thereof
were
under

brought
forth

shot
forth

Eze17:7
There
was
also
another
great
eagle
with
great
wings

many
this
vine
did
bend
her
roots
toward
him

and
shot
forth
her
branches
toward

he
might
water
it
by

furrows
of

It
was
planted

Eze23:1
The
word
of
the
LORD
came
again
unto
Eze23:2
Son
of

were
two
the
daughters
of
one
Eze23:3
And
they
committed
whoredoms
in
they
committed
whoredoms
in
their
there
were
their
breasts
and
there
they
bruised
the
teats
of
their

And
the
names
of
them
were
Aholah
the
and
Aholibah
her
and
they
were

they
bare
sons
and
Thus
were
their
Samaria
is
Aholah,
and
Jerusalem
Aholibah.
Eze23:5
And
Aholah
played
the
harlot
when
she
was
and
she
doted
on
her
on
the
Assyrians
her
Eze23:6
Which
were
clothed
with
captains
and
all
of
them
desirable
young
horsemen
riding
upon
Eze23:7
Thus
she
committed
her
whoredoms
with
with
all
them
that
were
the
chosen
men
of
and
with
all
on
whom
she
dot
with
all
their
idols
she
defiled
Eze23:8
Neither
left
she
her
whoredoms
brought
from
for
in
her
youth
they
lay
with
and
they
bruised
the
breasts
of
her
and
poured
their
whoredom
upon
Eze23:9
Wherefore
I
have
delivered
her
into
the
hand
of
her
into
the
hand
of
the
Assyrians,
upon
whom
she
Eze23:10
These
discovered
her
they
took
her
sons
and
her
and
slew
her
with
the
and
she
became
famous
a
mong
for
they
had
executed
judgment
upon
Eze23:11
And
when
her
sister
Aholibah
saw
she
was
more
corrupt
in
her
inordinate
love
than
and
in
her
whoredoms
more
tha
n
her
sister
in
her
whoredoms.
Eze23:12
She
doted
upon
the
Assyrians
her
captains
and
rulers
clothed
most
horsemen
riding
upon
all
of
them
desirable
young
Eze23:13
Then
I
saw
that
she
was
that
they
took
both
one
Eze23:14
And
that
she
increased
her
whoredoms:
for
when
she
saw
men
pourtrayed
upon
the
the
images
of
the
Chaldeans
pourtraye
d
with
Eze23:15
Girded
with
girdles
upon
their
exceeding
in
dyed
attire
upon
their
all
of
them
princes
to
look
after
the
manner
of
the
Babylonians
of
the
land
of
their
Eze23:16
And
as
soon
as
she
saw
them
with
her
she
doted
upon
and
sent
messengers
unto
them
into
Eze23:17
And
the
Babylonians
came
to
her
into
the
bed
of
and
they
defiled
her
with
their
and
she
was
polluted
with
and
her
mind
was
alienated
from
Eze23:18
So
she
discovered
her
whoredoms,
and
discovered
her
then
my
mind
was
alienated
from
like
as
my
mind
was
al
ienated
from
her
Eze23:19
Yet
she
multiplied
her
whoredoms,
in
calling
to
remembrance
the
days
of
her
wherein
she
had
played
the
harlot
in
th
e
land
of
Eze23:20
For
she
doted
upon
their
paramours,
whose
flesh
is
as
the
flesh
of
and
whose
issue
is
like
the
issue
of
Eze23:21
Thus
thou
calledst
to
remembrance
the
lewdness
of
thy
in
bruising
thy
teats
by
the
Egyptians
for
the
paps
of
thy
yo

Eze23:22
O
Aholibah,
thus
saith
the
Lord
I
will
raise
up
thy
lovers
against
from

thy
mind

bring
them
against
thee
on
every

Assyrians
with
all
of

desirable

captains
and
great
lords
and
all
of
them
riding
upon

And
they
shall
come
against
thee
with

and
with
an
assembly
of
which
shall
set

t
thee

and
shield
and

round
and
I
will
set
judgment
before

they
shall
judge
thee
according
to
their
Eze23:25
And
I
will
set
my
jealousy
against

they
shall
deal
furiously
with

thine

shall
also
strip
thee
out
of
thy
and
take
away
thy
fair
Eze23:27
Thus
will
I
make
thy
lewdness
to
cease
from
and
thy
whoredom
brought
from
the
land
of
so
that
thou
shalt
not
lift
up
thine
eyes
unto
nor
remember
Egypt
any
Eze23:28
For
thus
saith
the
Lord
I
will
deliver
thee
into
the
hand
of
them
whom
thou
hatest,
into
the
hand
of
them
fro
m
whom
thy
mind
is
Eze23:29
And
they
shall
deal
with
thee
and
shall
take
away
all
thy
and
shall
leave
thee
naked
and
and
the
nakedness
of
thy
whoredoms
shall
be
both
thy
lewdness
and
thy
whoredoms.
Eze23:30
I
will
do
these
things
unto
because
thou
hast
gone
a
whoring
after
the
and
because
thou
art
polluted
with
t
heir
Eze23:31
Thou
hast
walked
in
the
way
of
thy
therefore
will
I
give
her
cup
into
thine
Eze23:32
Thus
saith
the
Lord
Thou
shalt
drink
of
thy
sister's
cup
deep
and
thou
shalt
be
laughed
to
scorn
and
had
in
de
rision;
it
containeth
Eze23:33
Thou
shalt
be
filled
with
drunkenness
and
with
the
cup
of
astonishment
and
with
the
cup
of
thy
sister
Eze23:34
Thou
shalt
even
drink
it
and
suck
it
and
thou
shalt
break
the
sherds
and
pluck
off
thine
own
for
I
have
spoken
saith
the
Lord
Eze23:35
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
Because
thou
hast
forgotten
and
cast
me
behind
thy
therefore
bear
thou
also
t
hy
lewdness
and
thy
whoredoms.
Eze23:36
The
LORD
said
moreover
unto
Son
of
wilt
thou
judge
Aholah
and
Aholibah?
declare
unto
them
their
abominations
;
Eze23:37
That
they
have
committed
and
blood
is
in
their
and
with
their
idols
have
they
committed
and
hav
e
also
caused
their
whom
they
bare
unto
to
pass
for
them
through
the
to
devour
Eze23:38
Moreover
this
they
have
done
unto
they
have
defiled
my
sanctuary
in
the
same
and
have
profaned
my
sabbaths.
Eze23:39
For
when
they
had
slain
their
children
to
their
then
they
came
the
same
day
into
my
sanctuary
to
profane
l
o,
thus
have
they
done
in
the
midst
of
mine
Eze23:40
And
that
ye
have
sent
for
men
to
come
from
unto
whom
a
messenger
was
they
for
whom
thou
didst
wash
paintedst
thy
and
deckedst
thyself
with
Eze23:41
And
satest
upon
a
stately
and
a
table
prepared
before
whereupon
thou
hast
set
mine
incense
and
mine
Eze23:42
And
a
voice
of
a
multitude
being
at
ease
was
with
and
with
the
men
of
the
common
sort
were
brought
Sabeans
from
the
w
ilderness,
which
put
bracelets
upon
their
and
beautiful
crowns
upon
their
Eze23:43
Then
said
I
unto
her
that
was
old
in
adulteries,
Will
they
now
commit
whoredoms
with
and
she
with
Eze23:44
Yet
they
went
in
unto
as
they
go
in
unto
a
woman
that
playeth
the
so
went
they
in
unto
Aholah
and
unto
Aholib
the
lewd
Eze23:45
And
the
righteous
they
shall
judge
them
after
the
manner
of
and
after
the
manner
of
women
that
shed
blo
od;
because
they
are
and
blood
is
in
their
Eze23:46
For
thus
saith
the
Lord
I
will
bring
up
a
company
upon
and
will
give
them
to
be
removed
and
Eze23:47
And
the
company
shall
stone
them
with

dispatch
them
with
their

shall
slay
their
sons
and
their
da

and
burn
up
their
houses
with
Eze23:48
Thus
will
I
cause
lewdness
to
cease
out
of
the
that
all
women
may
be
taught
not
to
do
after
your
Eze23:49
And
they
shall
recompense
your
lewdness
upon
and
ye
shall
bear
the
sins
of
your

Eze24:1
Again
in
the
ninth
in

tenth
in
the
tenth
day
of
the

word
of

LORD
came
unto
Eze24:2
Son

himself

Eze24:3
And
utter
a
parable
unto
the
rebellious
and
say
unto
Thus
saith
the
Lord
Set

Take

burn

make

boil
and
let
them
seethe

Eze24:6
Wherefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
Woe
to
the
bloody
to
the
pot
whose
scum
is
and
whose
scum
is
not
gone
out
of
bring
it
out
piece
by
let
no
lot
fall
upon
Eze24:7
For
her
blood
is
in
the
midst
of

set
it
upon
the
top
of
a

poured
it
not

Eze24:8
That
it
might
cause

to
come
up
to
take

have
set
her
blood
upon
the
top
of

it
should
not
be
c

Eze24:9
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
Woe
to
the
bloody

will
even
make

pile
for
fire
Eze24:10
Heap
on

spice

and
let
the

be
Eze24:11
Then
set
it
empty
upon
the
coals
that
the
brass
of
it
may
be
and
may
and
that
the
filthiness
of
it
may
be
molten
in
that
the
scum
of
it
may
be
Eze24:12
She
hath
wearied
herself
with
and
her
great
scum
went
not
forth
out
of
her
scum

be
in

Eze24:13
In
thy
filthiness
is
because
I
have
purged
and
thou
wast
not
thou
shalt
not
be
purged
from
thy
fil

any
till
I
have
caused
my
fury
to
rest
upon
Eze24:14
I
the
LORD
have
spoken

saith
the
Lord
Eze24:15
Also
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
Eze24:16
Son
of
I
take
away
from
thee
the
desire
of
thine
eyes
with
a
yet
neither
shalt
thou
mourn
nor
n
either
shall
thy
tears
run
Eze24:17
Forbear
to
make
no
mourning
for

tire
of
thine

upon
and
put
on
thy
shoes
upon
thy

cover
not
thy

eat
not
the
bread
of
Eze24:18
So
I
spake
unto
the
people
in
the
and
at
even
my
wife
and
I
did
in
the
morning
as
I
was
Eze24:19
And
the
people
said
unto
Wilt
thou
not
tell
us
what
these
things
are
to
that
thou
doest
Eze24:20
Then
I
answered
The
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
Eze24:21
Speak
unto
the
house
of
Thus
saith
the
Lord
I
will
profane

the
desire
of

that
which
your

pitieth;
and
your
sons
and
your
daughters
whom
ye
have
left
shall
fall
by
th

Eze24:22
And
ye
shall
do
as
I
have
ye
shall
not
cover
your

eat
the
bread
of
Eze24:23
And
your
tires
shall
be
upon

your
shoes
upon
your

shall
not
mourn
nor
but
ye
shall
pine
awa

for

Thus
Ezekiel
is
unto
you
a
according
to
all
that

hath
done
shall

and
when
this
ye
shall
know
that

Eze24:25
thou

when
I
take

That

In

The
word
of
the
LORD
came
again
unto
Eze25:2
Son
of
set
thy
face
against
the
and
prophesy
against
Eze25:3
And
say
unto
the
Hear
the
word
of
the
Lord
Thus
saith
the
Lord
Because
thou
saidst,
against
my
sa
nctuary,
when
it
was
and
against
the
land
of
when
it
was
and
against
the
house
of
when
they
went
into
Eze25:4
therefore
I
will
deliver
thee
to
the
men
of
the
east
for
a
and
they
shall
set
their
palaces
in
an
d
make
their
dwellings
in
they
shall
eat
thy
and
they
shall
drink
thy
Eze25:5
And
I
will
make
Rabbah
a
stable
for
and
the
Ammonites
a
couching
place
for
and
ye
shall
know
that
I
am
the
Eze25:6
For
thus
saith
the
Lord
Because
thou
hast
clapped
thine
and
stamped
with
the
and
rejoiced
in
heart
with
a
ll
thy
despite
against
the
land
of
Eze25:7
therefore
I
will
stretch
out
mine
hand
upon
and
will
deliver
thee
for
a
spoil
to
the
and
I
will
cut
thee
off
from
the
and
I
will
cause
thee
to
perish
out
of
the
I
will
destroy
and
thou
shalt
know
that
I
am
the
Eze25:8
Thus
saith
the
Lord
Because
that
Moab
and
Seir
do
the
house
of
Judah
is
like
unto
all
the
Eze25:9
I
will
open
the
side
of
Moab
from
the
from
his
cities
which
are
on
his
the
glory
of
t
he
Bethjeshimoth,
Baalmeon,
and
Kiriathaim,
Eze25:10
Unto
the
men
of
the
east
with
the
and
will
give
them
in
that
the
Ammonites
may
not
be
remembered
am
ong
the
Eze25:11
And
I
will
execute
judgments
upon
and
they
shall
know
that
I
am

Eze25:12
Thus
saith
the
Lord
Because
that
Edom
hath
dealt
against
the
house
of
Judah
by
taking
and
hath
greatly
off
and
revenged
himself
upon
Eze25:13
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
I
will
also
stretch
out
mine
hand
upon
and
will
cut
off
man
and
beast
from
an
d
I
will
make
it
desolate
from
Teman;
and
they
of
Dedan
shall
fall
by
the
Eze25:14
And
I
will
lay
my
vengeance
upon
Edom
by
the
hand
of
my
people
and
they
shall
do
in
Edom
according
to
mine
anger
a
nd
according
to
my
and
they
shall
know
my
saith
the
Lord
Eze25:15
Thus
saith
the
Lord
Because
the
Philistines
have
dealt
by
and
have
taken
vengeance
with
a
despiteful
to
destroy
it
for
the
old
Eze25:16
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
I
will
stretch
out
mine
hand
upon
the
and
I
will
cut
off
the
Chere
thims,
and
destroy
the
remnant
of
the
sea
Eze25:17
And
I
will
execute
great
vengeance
upon
them
with
furious
and
they
shall
know
that
I
am
the
when
I
shall
la
y
my
vengeance
upon
Eze26:1
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
eleventh
in
the
first
day
of
the
that
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
Eze26:2

Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
I
am
against
O
Tyrus,
and
will
cause
many
nations
to
come
up
against
as
the
sea
causeth
his
waves
to
come
Eze26:4
And
they
shall
destroy
the
walls
of
Tyrus,
and
break
down
her
I
will
also
scrape
her
dust
from
and
make
her
li

top
of
a
Eze26:5
It
shall
be
a
place
for
the
spreading
of
nets
in
the
midst
of

I
have
spoken

the
Lord
and
it
sha

become
a
spoil
to

Eze26:6
And
her
daughters
which
are
in

be
slain
by

and
they
shall
know
that

For

the
Lord
I
will
bring

And
he
shall
set
engines
of

By
reason
of
the
abundance
of

shake
at
the
noise
of

And
they

And
I
will
cause
the
noise
of
thy
songs
to

the
sound
of
thy
harps
shall
be
no
more
Eze26:14
And
I
will
make
thee
like

shalt
be

Eze26:15
Thus
saith
the
Lord

the
sound
of

wounded
when

Then

Son
of

unto
Thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD
unto

Woe
be
to
the
shepherds
of
Israel
that

Ye
eat

The

bound
up
that
which

neither
have
ye
brought

driven
neither

ye
sought

with
force
and
wi

cruelty
have
ye
ruled
Eze34:5
And
they
were
because
there
is
no

they
became
meat
to
all

beasts
of
the
when
they
were
Eze34:6
My
sheep
wandered
through
all

upon
every

was
scattered
upon

As
I
saith
the
Lord
surely
because
my

to
every

of

because
there
was

did
my

Eze34:9
O
ye
hear
the
word
of

Eze34:10
Thus
saith
the
Lord
I
am
against

I
will
require
my

at

cause
them
to
cease
from

feed
themselves
any
for
I
will
deliver
my

from
their

they
may
not

meat
for
Eze34:11
For
thus
saith
the
Lord
even
will
both
search
my

seek
them
Eze34:12
As
a
shepherd
seeketh
out
his
flock
in
the
day
that
he
is
among
his
sheep
that
are
so
will
I
seek
out
my

will
deliver
them
out
of
all
places
where
they
have
been
scattered
in
the
cloudy
and
dark
Eze34:13
And
I
will
bring
them
out
from

gather
them
from

and
will
bring
them
to
their
own
and
feed
them
upon
the
mountains
of
Israel
by
the
and
in
all
the
inhabited
places
of

Eze34:14
I
will
feed

upon

high
mountains
of
Israel
shall
their

there
shall
they
lie
in
a
g

and
in
a
fat
pasture
shall
they
feed
upon
the
mountains
of
Eze34:15
I
will
feed
my
and
I
will
cause
them
to
lie
saith
the
Lord
Eze34:16
I
will
seek
that
which
was
and
bring
again
that
which
was
driven
and
will
bind
up
that
which
was

w
ill
strengthen
that
which
was

I
will
destroy

will
feed
them
with
Eze34:17
And
as
for
O
my
thus
saith
the
Lord
I
judge
between
cattle
and
between
the
rams
and
the

Eze34:18
Seemeth
it
a
small
thing
unto
you
to
have
eaten
up

but
ye
must
tread
down
with
your
feet
the
residue
of

to
have
drunk
of

ye
must
foul
the
residue
with
your

And
as
for

eat
that
which
ye
have
trodden
with
your

they
drink
that
which
ye
have
fouled
with
you
r
Eze34:20
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
GOD
unto
even
will
judge
between
the
fat
cattle
and
between
the
lean
cat

Eze34:21
Because
ye
have
thrust
with
side
and
with
and
pushed
all
the
diseased
with
your

ye
have
scattered

Eze34:22
Therefore
will
I
save
my
and
they
shall
no
more

I
will
judge
between
cattle
and
Eze34:23
And
I
will
set
up
one
shepherd
over

have
spoken

And
I
will
make
with
them
a
covenant
of

will
cause

evil
beasts
to
cease
out
of

safely

And
I
will
make

there
shall
be
showers
of
Eze34:27
And
the
tree
of

shall
yield

earth
shall
yield

shall
be
safe
in

shall
know
that
I

broken

bands
of

delivered
them
out
of

hand
of

And
they
shall
no

And
I
will
raise
up
for

Moreover

O

Eze35:4
I
will
lay

thou
shalt
know
that
I

Because
thou

Thus

I
make

cut
off
from
it
him
that
passeth
out

him
that
returneth.
Eze35:8
And

even
do
according

thine
envy
which
thou
hast
used

Thus
saith
the
Lord
When

will
make

As

Therefore

Surely
in

I
spoken
against

Because

Son

Israel
dwelt
in
their
own

defiled
it
by
their

way

by
their
their
way
was
before
me
as
the
uncleanness
of
a

Eze36:18
Wherefore
I
poured
my
fury
upon
them
for
the
blood
that
they
had
shed
upon
the
and
for
their
idols
wherewith
they
ha
d
polluted
Eze36:19
And
I
scattered
them
among

and
they
were
dispersed
through
the
according
to
their
way
and
accordin

to
their
doings
I
judged
Eze36:20
And
when
they
entered
unto
the
whither
they
they
profaned
my
holy
when
they
said
to
These

people
of

gone
forth
out
of

But
I
had
pity
for
mine
holy
which
the
house
of
Israel
had
profaned
among
the
whither
they
Eze36:22
Therefore
say
unto
the
house
of
Thus
saith
the
Lord
I
do
not
this
for
your
O
house
of

for
mine
holy
name's
which
ye
have
profaned
among

And
I
will
sanctify
my
great
which
was
profaned
among
the
which
ye
have
profaned
in
the
midst
of

the
heathen
shall
know
that
I
am
the
saith
the
Lord
when
I
shall
be
sanctified
in
you
before
their
Eze36:24
For
I
will
take
you
from
among
the
and
gather
you
out
of
all
and
will
bring
you
into
your
own
Eze36:25
Then
will
I
sprinkle
clean
water
upon
and
ye
shall
be
from
all
your

from
all

I
cleanse
Eze36:26
A

will
I
give

a
new
spirit
will
I
put
within

I
will
take
away
the
stony
heart
out
of
your

give
you
an
heart
of
Eze36:27
And
I
will
put

cause
you

And

I

Eze36:30
And

Eze36:31
Then

remember
your

lothe
yourselves

In

And

Then

Now

For
they

When

Now

of
Judah
into
his
with
part
of
the
vessels
of
the
house
of
which
he
carried
into
the
land
of
Shinar
to
the
house
of
his
and
he
brought
the
vessels
into
the
treasure
house
of
his
Dan1:3
And
the
king
spake
unto
Ashpenaz
the
master
of
his
that
he
should
bring
certain
of
the
children
of
and
of
t
he
king's
and
of
the
Dan1:4
Children
in
whom
was
no
but
well
and
skilful
in
all
and
cunning
in
and
understanding
s
cience,
and
such
as
had
ability
in
them
to
stand
in
the
king's
and
whom
they
might
teach
the
learning
and
the
tongue
of
the
Chaldeans.
Dan1:5
And
the
king
appointed
them
a
daily
provision
of
the
king's
and
of
the
wine
which
he
so
nourishing
them
three
y
that
at
the
end
thereof
they
might
stand
before
the
Dan1:6
Now
among
these
were
of
the
children
of
Hananiah,
Mishael,
and
Azariah:
Dan1:7
Unto
whom
the
prince
of
the
eunuchs
gave
for
he
gave
unto
Daniel
the
name
of
Belteshazzar;
and
to
Hananiah,
of
Shadra
ch;
and
to
Mishael,
of
and
to
Azariah,
of
Dan1:8
But
Daniel
purposed
in
his
heart
that
he
would
not
defile
himself
with
the
portion
of
the
king's
nor
with
the
wine
whi
ch
he
therefore
he
requested
of
the
prince
of
the
eunuchs
that
he
might
not
defile
Dan1:9
Now
God
had
brought
Daniel
into
favour
and
tender
love
with
the
prince
of
the
Dan1:10
And
the
prince
of
the
eunuchs
said
unto
I
fear
my
lord
the
who
hath
appointed
your
meat
and
your
for
w
hy
should
he
see
your
faces
worse
liking
than
the
children
which
are
of
your
then
shall
ye
make
me
endanger
my
head
to
the
ki
ng.
Dan1:11
Then
said
Daniel
to
Melzar,
whom
the
prince
of
the
eunuchs
had
set
over
Hananiah,
Mishael,
and
Azariah,
Dan1:12
Prove
thy
I
beseech
ten
and
let
them
give
us
pulse
to
and
water
to
Dan1:13
Then
let
our
countenances
be
looked
upon
before
and
the
countenance
of
the
children
that
eat
of
the
portion
of
the
ki
ng's
and
as
thou
seest,
deal
with
thy
Dan1:14
So
he
consented
to
them
in
this
and
proved
them
ten
Dan1:15
And
at
the
end
of
ten
days
their
countenances
appeared
fairer
and
fatter
in
flesh
than
all
the
children
which
did
eat
the
p
ortion
of
the
king's
Dan1:16
Thus
Melzar
took
away
the
portion
of
their
and
the
wine
that
they
should
and
gave
them
Dan1:17
As
for
these
four
God
gave
them
knowledge
and
skill
in
all
learning
and
and
Daniel
had
understanding
in
a
ll
visions
and
Dan1:18
Now
at
the
end
of
the
days
that
the
king
had
said
he
should
bring
them
then
the
prince
of
the
eunuchs
brought
them
in
b
efore
Dan1:19
And
the
king
communed
with
and
among
them
all
was
found
none
like
Hananiah,
Mishael,
and
Azariah:
therefore
s
tood
they
before
the
Dan1:20
And
in
all
matters
of
wisdom
and
that
the
king
enquired
of
he
found
them
ten
times
better
than
all
the
magicians
and
astrologers
that
were
in
all
his
Dan1:21
And
Daniel
continued
even
unto
the
first
year
of
king
Dan2:1
And
in
the
second
year
of
the
reign
of
Nebuchadnezzar
Nebuchadnezzar
dreamed
wherewith
his
spirit
was
and
his
sleep
brake
from
Dan2:2
Then
the
king
commanded
to
call
the
and
the
and
the
and
the
Chaldeans,
for
to
shew
the
ki
ng
his
So
they
came
and
stood
before
the
Dan2:3
And
the
king
said
unto
I
have
dreamed
a
and
my
spirit
was
troubled
to
know
the
Dan2:4
Then
spake
the
Chaldeans
to
the
king
in
Syriack,
O
live
for
tell
thy
servants
the
and
we
will
shew
the
in
terpretation.
Dan2:5
The
king
answered
and
said
to
the
Chaldeans,
The
thing
is
gone
from
if
ye
will
not
make
known
unto
me
the
with
th
e
interpretation
ye
shall
be
cut
in
and
your
houses
shall
be
made
a
Dan2:6
But
if
ye
shew
the
and
the
interpretation
ye
shall
receive
of
me
gifts
and
rewards
and
great
therefo
re
shew
me
the
and
the
interpretation
Dan2:7
They
answered
again
and
Let
the
king
tell
his
servants
the
and
we
will
shew
the
interpretation
of
Dan2:8
The
king
answered
and
I
know
of
certainty
that
ye
would
gain
the
because
ye
see
the
thing
is
gone
from
Dan2:9
But
if
ye
will
not
make
known
unto
me
the
there
is
but
one
decree
for
for
ye
have
prepared
lying
and
corrupt
wor
ds
to
speak
before
till
the
time
be
therefore
tell
me
the
and
I
shall
know
that
ye
can
shew
me
the
interpretati
on
Dan2:10
The
Chaldeans
answered
before
the
and
There
is
not
a
man
upon
the
earth
that
can
shew
the
king's
theref
ore
there
is
no
nor
that
asked
such
things
at
any
or
or
Dan2:11
And
it
is
a
rare
thing
that
the
king
requireth,
and
there
is
none
other
that
can
shew
it
before
the
except
the
whose
dwelling
is
not
with
Dan2:12
For
this
cause
the
king
was
angry
and
very
and
commanded
to
destroy
all
the
wise
men
of
Dan2:13
And
the
decree
went
forth
that
the
wise
men
should
be
and
they
sought
Daniel
and
his
fellows
to
be
Dan2:14
Then
Daniel
answered
with
counsel
and
wisdom
to
Arioch
the
captain
of
the
king's
which
was
gone
forth
to
slay
the
wi
se
men
of
Dan2:15
He
answered
and
said
to
Arioch
the
king's
Why
is
the
decree
so
hasty
from
the
Then
Arioch
made
the
thing
kno
wn
to
Dan2:16
Then
Daniel
went
and
desired
of
the
king
that
he
would
give
him
and
that
he
would
shew
the
king
the
interpretatio
n.
Dan2:17
Then
Daniel
went
to
his
and
made
the
thing
known
to
Hananiah,
Mishael,
and
Azariah,
his
Dan2:18
That
they
would
desire
mercies
of
the
God
of
heaven
concerning
this
that
Daniel
and
his
fellows
should
not
perish
w
ith
the
rest
of
the
wise
men
of
Dan2:19
Then
was
the
secret
revealed
unto
Daniel
in
a
night
Then
Daniel
blessed
the
God
of
Dan2:20
Daniel
answered
and
Blessed
be
the
name
of
God
for
ever
and
for
wisdom
and
might
are
Dan2:21
And
he
changeth
the
times
and
the
he
removeth
and
setteth
up
he
giveth
wisdom
unto
the
and
kno
wledge
to
them
that
know
Dan2:22
He
revealeth
the
deep
and
secret
he
knoweth
what
is
in
the
and
the
light
dwelleth
with
Dan2:23
I
thank
and
praise
O
thou
God
of
my
who
hast
given
me
wisdom
and
and
hast
made
known
unto
me
no
w
what
we
desired
of
for
thou
hast
now
made
known
unto
us
the
king's
Dan2:24
Therefore
Daniel
went
in
unto
Arioch,
whom
the
king
had
ordained
to
destroy
the
wise
men
of
he
went
and
said
thus
unto
Destroy
not
the
wise
men
of
bring
me
in
before
the
and
I
will
shew
unto
the
king
the
Dan2:25
Then
Arioch
brought
in
Daniel
before
the
king
in
and
said
thus
unto
I
have
found
a
man
of
the
captives
of
Judah
,
that
will
make
known
unto
the
king
the
Dan2:26
The
king
answered
and
said
to
whose
name
was
Belteshazzar,
Art
thou
able
to
make
known
unto
me
the
dream
which
I
ha
ve
and
the
interpretation
Dan2:27
Daniel
answered
in
the
presence
of
the
and
The
secret
which
the
king
hath
demanded
cannot
the
wise
the
ast
rologers,
the
the
shew
unto
the
Dan2:28
But
there
is
a
God
in
heaven
that
revealeth
and
maketh
known
to
the
king
Nebuchadnezzar
what
shall
be
in
the
latte
r
Thy
and
the
visions
of
thy
head
upon
thy
are
Dan2:29
As
for
O
thy
thoughts
came
into
thy
mind
upon
thy
what
should
come
to
pass
and
he
that
revealet
h
secrets
maketh
known
to
thee
what
shall
come
to
Dan2:30
But
as
for
this
secret
is
not
revealed
to
me
for
any
wisdom
that
I
have
more
than
any
but
for
their
sakes
that
shall
make
known
the
interpretation
to
the
and
that
thou
mightest
know
the
thoughts
of
thy
Dan2:31
O
sawest,
and
behold
a
great
This
great
whose
brightness
was
stood
before
and
th
e
form
thereof
was
Dan2:32
This
image's
head
was
of
fine
his
breast
and
his
arms
of
his
belly
and
his
thighs
of
Dan2:33
His
legs
of
his
feet
part
of
iron
and
part
of
Dan2:34
Thou
sawest
till
that
a
stone
was
cut
out
without
which
smote
the
image
upon
his
feet
that
were
of
iron
and
an
d
brake
them
to
Dan2:35
Then
was
the
the
the
the
and
the
broken
to
pieces
and
became
like
the
chaff
of
t
he
summer
threshingfloors;
and
the
wind
carried
them
that
no
place
was
found
for
and
the
stone
that
smote
the
image
bec
ame
a
great
and
filled
the
whole
Dan2:36
This
is
the
and
we
will
tell
the
interpretation
thereof
before
the
Dan2:37
O
art
a
king
of
for
the
God
of
heaven
hath
given
thee
a
and
and
Dan2:38
And
wheresoever
the
children
of
men
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
the
fowls
of
the
heaven
hath
he
given
into
thine
han
d,
and
hath
made
thee
ruler
over
them
Thou
art
this
head
of
Dan2:39
And
after
thee
shall
arise
another
kingdom
inferior
to
and
another
third
kingdom
of
which
shall
bear
rule
over
all
the
Dan2:40
And
the
fourth
kingdom
shall
be
strong
as
forasmuch
as
iron
breaketh
in
pieces
and
subdueth
all
and
as
iron
t
hat
breaketh
all
shall
it
break
in
pieces
and
Dan2:41
And
whereas
thou
sawest
the
feet
and
part
of
and
part
of
the
kingdom
shall
be
but
there
shall
be
in
it
of
the
strength
of
the
forasmuch
as
thou
sawest
the
iron
mixed
with
miry
Dan2:42
And
as
the
toes
of
the
feet
were
part
of
and
part
of

the
kingdom
shall
be
partly

And
whereas
thou
sawest
iron
mixed
with
miry
they
shall
mingle
themselves
with
the
seed
of
but
they
shall
not
cl
eave
one
to
even
as
iron
is
not
mixed
with
Dan2:44
And
in
the
days
of
these
kings
shall
the
God
of
heaven
set
up
a
which
shall
never
be
and
the
kingdom
sh
all
not
be
left
to
other
but
it
shall
break
in
pieces
and
consume
all
these
and
it
shall
stand
for
Dan2:45
Forasmuch
as
thou
sawest
that
the
stone
was
cut
out
of
the
mountain
without
and
that
it
brake
in
pieces
the
th

the

the
the

God
hath
made
known
to
the
king
what
shall
come
to
pass
and
the
d
ream
is
and
the
interpretation
thereof
Dan2:46
Then
the
king
Nebuchadnezzar
fell
upon
his
and
worshipped
and
commanded
that
they
should
offer
an
oblation
an
d
sweet
odours
unto
Dan2:47
The
king
answered
unto
and
Of
a
truth
it
that
your
God
is
a
God
of
and
a
Lord
of
and
a
revea

of
seeing

couldest
reveal

Then
the
king
made
Daniel
a
great
and
gave
him
many
great
and
made
him
ruler
over
the
whole
province
of
Babylon
,
and
chief
of
the
governors
over
all
the
wise
men
of

Then
Daniel
requested

he
set

over

Daniel
sat
in
the
gate
of

Nebuchadnezzar
the
king
made
an
image
of
whose
height
was
threescore
cubits,
and
the
breadth
thereof
six
cubits:
he
se
t
it
up
in
the
plain
of
Dura,
in
the
province
of
Dan3:2
Then
Nebuchadnezzar
the
king
sent
to
gather
together

all
the

Then
the
the
and
the
the
treasurers,
the

all
the
rulers
of

gathered
together
unto
the
dedication
of
the
image
that
Nebuchadnezzar
the
king
had
set
and
they
stood
before
the
image
that
Nebuchadnezzar
had
set
Dan3:4
Then
an
herald
cried
To
you
it
is
O

Dan3:5
That
at
what
time
ye
hear
the
sound
of
the

all
kinds
of

ye
fal

down
and
worship
the
golden
image
that
Nebuchadnezzar
the
king
hath
set
Dan3:6
And
whoso
falleth
not
down
and
worshippeth
shall
the
same
hour
be
cast
into
the
midst
of
a
burning
fiery
Dan3:7
Therefore
at
that
when
all
the
people
heard
the
sound
of
the
and
all
kinds
of
musick,
all
the
the
and
the
fell
down
and
worshipped
the
golden
image
that
Nebuchadnezzar
the
king
had
set
Dan3:8
Wherefore
at
that
time
certain
Chaldeans
came
and
accused
the
Dan3:9
They
spake
and
said
to
the
king
O
live
for
Dan3:10
O
hast
made
a
that
every
man
that
shall
hear
the
sound
of

shall
fall
down

worship
the

And
whoso
falleth
not
down
and
worshippeth,
that
he
should
be
cast
into
the
midst
of
a
burning
fiery
Dan3:12
There
are
certain
Jews
whom
thou
hast
set
over
the
affairs
of
the
province
of

the

O
have
not
regarded
they
serve
not
thy
nor
worship
the
golden
image
which
thou
hast
set
Dan3:13
Then
Nebuchadnezzar
in
his
rage
and
fury
commanded
to
bring
and
Then
they
brought
these
men
be
fore
the
Dan3:14
Nebuchadnezzar
spake
and
said
unto
Is
it
O

do
not
ye
serve
my
nor

the
golden
image
which
I
have
set

Now
if
ye
be
ready
that
at
what
time
ye
hear
the
sound
of
the
and
and
all
kinds
of
musick,
ye
fall
down

worship
the

which
I
have
but
if

be
cast
the

hour
into
the
midst
of
a
burning
fiery
and
who
is
that
God
that
shall
deliver
you
out
of
my
Dan3:16
and
answered
and
said
to
the
O
we
are
not
careful
to
answer
thee
in
this
Dan3:17
If
it
be
our
God
whom
we
serve
is
able
to
deliver
us
from
the
burning
fiery
and
he
will
deliver
us
out
of

But
if
be

known
unto
O
that
we
will
not
serve
thy
nor
worship
the
golden
image
which
thou
hast
se

Dan3:19
Then
was
Nebuchadnezzar
full
of
and
the
form
of
his
visage
was
changed
against
and
there
fore
he
and
commanded
that
they
should
heat
the
furnace
one
seven
times
more
than
it
was
wont
to
be
Dan3:20
And
he
commanded
the
most
mighty
men
that
were
in
his
army
to
bind
and
and
to
cast
them
into
t
he
burning
fiery
Dan3:21
Then
these
men
were
bound
in
their
their
hosen,
and
their

their
other
and
were
cast
into
the
mid
st
of
the
burning
fiery
Dan3:22
Therefore
because
the
king's
commandment
was
and
the
furnace
exceeding
the
flame
of
the
fire
slew
those
men
th
at
took
up
and
Dan3:23
And
these
three

fell
down
bound
into
the

Then
Nebuchadnezzar
the
king
was
and
rose
up
in

and
said
unto
his

not

cast
three
men
bound
into
the
midst

They
answered
and
said
unto
the
O
Dan3:25
He
answered
and
I
see
four
men
walking
in
the
midst
of
the
and
they
have
no
and
the
form
of
th
e
fourth
is
like
the
Son
of
Dan3:26
Then
Nebuchadnezzar
came
near
to
the
mouth
of
the
burning
fiery
and
and
and
Abedne
ye
servants
of
the
most
high
come
and
come
Then
and
came
forth
of
the
midst
of
the
Dan3:27
And
the
and
and
the
king's
being
gathered
saw
these
upon
whose
bo
dies
the
fire
had
no
nor
was
an
hair
of
their
head
neither
were
their
coats
nor
the
smell
of
fire
had
passe

on
Dan3:28
Then
Nebuchadnezzar
and
Blessed
be
the
God
of
and
who
hath
sent
his
and
de
livered
his
servants
that
trusted
in
and
have
changed
the
king's
and
yielded
their
that
they
might
not
serve
nor
worship
any

own

Therefore
I
make

That

there
is
no

that
can

the
king
promoted

province
of

Nebuchadnezzar
the
unto
all
and
that
dwell
in
all
the
Peace
be
multiplied
unto
Dan4:2
I
thought
it
good
to
shew
the
signs
and
wonders
that
the
high
God
hath
wrought
toward
Dan4:3
How
great
are
his
and
how
mighty
are
his
his
kingdom
is
an
everlasting
and
his
dominion
is
from
gen

to
Dan4:4
I
Nebuchadnezzar
was
at
rest
in
mine
and
flourishing
in
my
Dan4:5
I
saw
a
dream
which
made
me
and
the
thoughts
upon
my
bed
and
the
visions
of
my
head
troubled
Dan4:6
Therefore
made
I
a
decree
to
bring
in
all
the
wise
men
of
Babylon
before
that
they
might
make
known
unto
me
the
interpre
tation
of
the
Dan4:7
Then
came
in
the
the
the
Chaldeans,
and
the
and
I
told
the
dream
before
but
they
did
not
make
known
unto
me
the
interpretation
Dan4:8
But
at
the
last
Daniel
came
in
before
whose
name
was
Belteshazzar,
according
to
the
name
of
my
and
in
whom
is
the
s
pirit
of
the
holy
and
before
him
I
told
the
Dan4:9
O
Belteshazzar,
master
of
the
because
I
know
that
the
spirit
of
the
holy
gods
is
in
and
no
secret
troubleth
tell
me
the
visions
of
my
dream
that
I
have
and
the
interpretation
Dan4:10
Thus
were
the
visions
of
mine
head
in
my
I
and
behold
a
tree
in
the
midst
of
the
and
the
height
thereof
wa
s
Dan4:11
The
tree
and
was
and
the
height
thereof
reached
unto
and
the
sight
thereof
to
the
end
of
all
the

h:
Dan4:12
The
leaves
thereof
were
and
the
fruit
thereof
and
in
it
was
meat
for
the
beasts
of
the
field
had
shadow
un
der
and
the
fowls
of
the
heaven
dwelt
in
the
boughs
and
all
flesh
was
fed
of
Dan4:13
I
saw
in
the
visions
of
my
head
upon
my
a
watcher
and
an
holy
one
came
down
from
Dan4:14
He
cried
and
said
Hew
down
the
and
cut
off
his
shake
off
his
and
scatter
his
le
t
the
beasts
get
away
from
under
and
the
fowls
from
his
Dan4:15
Nevertheless
leave
the
stump
of
his
roots
in
the
even
with
a
band
of
iron
and
in
the
tender
grass
of
the
fiel
d;
and
let
it
be
wet
with
the
dew
of
and
let
his
portion
be
with
the
beasts
in
the
grass
of
the
Dan4:16
Let
his
heart
be
changed
from
and
let
a
beast's
heart
be
given
unto
and
let
seven
times
pass
over
Dan4:17
This
matter
is
by
the
decree
of
the
and
the
demand
by
the
word
of
the
holy
to
the
intent
that
the
living
ma
y
know
that
the
most
High
ruleth
in
the
kingdom
of
and
giveth
it
to
whomsoever
he
and
setteth
up
over
it
the
basest
of

Dan4:18
This
dream
I
king
Nebuchadnezzar
have
Now
O
Belteshazzar,
declare
the
interpretation
forasmuch
as
all
the
wise
men
of
my
kingdom
are
not
able
to
make
known
unto
me
the
but
thou
art
for
the
spirit
of
the
holy
god

is
in
Dan4:19
Then
whose
name
was
Belteshazzar,
was
astonied
for
one
and
his
thoughts
troubled
The
king
and
sai
d,
Belteshazzar,
let
not
the
or
the
interpretation
trouble
Belteshazzar
answered
and
My
the
dream
be
to
them
that
hate
and
the
interpretation
thereof
to
thine
Dan4:20
The
tree
that
thou
sawest,
which
and
was

height
reached
unto

and
the
sight
thereof
to
all

Whose
leaves
were

the
fruit
thereof
and
in
it
was

reacheth
unto

thy
dominio

the
end
of

Dan4:23
And
whereas
the
king
saw
a
watcher
and
an
holy
one
coming
down
from
and
Hew
the
tree
and
destroy
yet
leave
the
stump
of
the
roots
thereof
in

with
a

in

of

let
his

the
beasts

till
seven
times
pass
over
Dan4:24
This
is
the
O
and
this
is
the
decree
of
the
most
which
is
come
upon
my
lord
the
Dan4:25
That
they
shall
drive
thee
from
and
thy
dwelling
shall
be
with
the
beasts
of

and
they
shall
make
thee
to

they

seven
times

thou
know
that
the
most
High
ruleth
in
the
kingdom
of
and
giveth
it
to
whomsoever
he
Dan4:26
And
whereas
they
commanded
to
leave
the
stump
of
the
tree
thy
kingdom
shall
be
sure
unto
after
that
thou
shalt
have
known
that
the
heavens
do
Dan4:27
O
let
my
counsel
be
acceptable
unto
and
break
off
thy
sins
by
and
thine
iniquities
by
shewing
mercy
to
the
if
it
may
be
a
lengthening
of
thy
Dan4:28
All
this
came
upon
the
king
Dan4:29
At
the
end
of
twelve
months
he
walked
in
the
palace
of
the
kingdom
of
Dan4:30
The
king
and
Is
not
this
great
that
I
have
built
for
the
house
of
the
kingdom
by
the
might
of
my
powe
r,
and
for
the
honour
of
my
Dan4:31
While
the
word
was
in
the
king's
there
fell
a
voice
from
O
king
to
thee
it
is
spoken
;
The
kingdom
is
departed
from
Dan4:32
And
they
shall
drive
thee
from
and
thy
dwelling
shall
be
with
the
beasts
of
the
they
shall
make
thee
to
eat
gra
ss
as
and
seven
times
shall
pass
over
until
thou
know
that
the
most
High
ruleth
in
the
kingdom
of
and
giveth
it
to
whomsoever
he
Dan4:33
The
same
hour
was
the
thing
fulfilled
upon
and
he
was
driven
from
and
did
eat
grass
as
and
his
b
ody
was
wet
with
the
dew
of
till
his
hairs
were
grown
like
and
his
nails
like
Dan4:34
And
at
the
end
of
the
days
I
Nebuchadnezzar
lifted
up
mine
eyes
unto
and
mine
understanding
returned
unto
and
I
blessed
the
most
and
I
praised
and
honoured
him
that
liveth
for
whose
dominion
is
an
everlasting
and
his
kin
gdom
is
from
generation
to
Dan4:35
And
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
are
reputed
as
and
he
doeth
according
to
his
will
in
the
army
of
and
among
the
inhabitants
of
the
and
none
can
stay
his
or
say
unto
What
doest
Dan4:36
At
the
same
time
my
reason
returned
unto
and
for
the
glory
of
my
mine
honour
and
brightness
returned
unto
and
my
counsellors
and
my
lords
sought
unto
and
I
was
established
in
my
and
excellent
majesty
was
added
unto
Dan4:37
Now
I
Nebuchadnezzar
praise
and
extol
and
honour
the
King
of
all
whose
works
are
and
his
ways
and
those
that
walk
in
pride
he
is
able
to
Dan5:1
Belshazzar
the
king
made
a
great
feast
to
a
thousand
of
his
and
drank
wine
before
the
Dan5:2
whiles
he
tasted
the
commanded
to
bring
the
golden
and
silver
vessels
which
his
father
Nebuchadnezzar
had
taken
out
of
the
temple
which
was
in
that
the
and
his
his
and
his
might
drink
Dan5:3
Then
they
brought
the
golden
vessels
that
were
taken
out
of
the
temple
of
the
house
of
God
which
was
at
and
the
k
ing,
and
his
his
and
his
drank
in
Dan5:4
They
drank
and
praised
the
gods
of
and
of
of
of
of
and
of
Dan5:5
In
the
same
hour
came
forth
fingers
of
a
man's
and
wrote
over
against
the
candlestick
upon
the
plaister
of
the
wall
of
the
king's
and
the
king
saw
the
part
of
the
hand
that
Dan5:6
Then
the
king's
countenance
was
and
his
thoughts
troubled
so
that
the
joints
of
his
loins
were
and
his
knees
smote
one
against
Dan5:7
The
king
cried
aloud
to
bring
in
the
the
Chaldeans,
and
the
And
the
king
and
said
to
the
wi
se
men
of
Whosoever
shall
read
this
and
shew
me
the
interpretation
shall
be
clothed
with
and
ha

a
chain
of
gold
about
his
and
shall
be
the
third
ruler
in

Dan5:8
Then
came
in
all
the
king's
wise
but
they
could
not
read
the
nor
make
known
to
the
king
the
interpretation
the
reof.
Dan5:9
Then
was
king
Belshazzar
greatly
and
his
countenance
was
changed
in
and
his
lords
were
Dan5:10
Now
the
queen
by
reason
of
the
words
of
the
king
and
his
lords
came
into
the
banquet
and
the
queen
spake
and
O
live
for
let
not
thy
thoughts
trouble
nor
let
thy
countenance
be
Dan5:11
There
is
a
man
in
thy
in
whom
is
the
spirit
of
the
holy
and
in
the
days
of
thy
father

and
like
the
wisdom
of

was
found
in
whom
the
king
Nebuchadnezzar

made
master
of
the
Chaldeans,
and
Dan5:12
Forasmuch
as
an
excellent
and
and
interpreting
of
and
shewing
of
hard
and
dissolving
of
were
found
in
the
same
whom
the
king
named
Belteshazzar:
now
let
Daniel
be
and
he
will
sh

the
Dan5:13
Then
was
Daniel
brought
in
before
the
And
the
king
spake
and
said
unto
Art
thou
that
which
art
of
the
children
of
the
captivity
of
whom
the
king
my
father
brought
out
of
Dan5:14
I
have
even
heard
of
that
the
spirit
of
the
gods
is
in
and
that
light
and
understanding
and
excellent
wisdom
is
found
in
Dan5:15
And
now
the
wise
the
have
been
brought
in
before
that
they
should
read
this
and
make
known
u
nto
me
the
interpretation
but
they
could
not
shew
the
interpretation
of
the
Dan5:16
And
I
have
heard
of
that
thou
canst
make
and
dissolve
now
if
thou
canst
read
the
an
d
make
known
to
me
the
interpretation
thou
shalt
be
clothed
with
and
have
a
chain
of
gold
about
thy
and
sha

be
the
third
ruler
in
the
Dan5:17
Then
Daniel
answered
and
said
before
the
Let
thy
gifts
be
to
and
give
thy
rewards
to
yet
I
will
rea
d
the
writing
unto

and
make

to

Dan5:18
O
thou
the
most

God
gave
Nebuchadnezzar
thy

Dan5:19
And
for
the
majesty
that
he
gave
all
and
trembled
and
feared
before

and
whom
he
would
he
kept
and
whom

would

set

whom

would
he
put
Dan5:20
But
when
his
heart
was
lifted
and
his
mind
hardened
in
he
was
deposed
from
his
kingly
and
they
took
his
glory
from
Dan5:21
And
he
was
driven
from
the
sons
of
and
his
heart
was
made
like
the
and
his
dwelling
was
with
the
wild
t
hey
fed
him
with
grass
like
and
his
body
was
wet
with
the
dew
of
till
he
knew
that
the
most
high
God
ruled
in
the
kin
gdom
of
and
that
he
appointeth
over
it
whomsoever

Dan5:22
And
thou
his
O
hast
not
humbled
thine
though
thou
knewest
all

But
hast
lifted
up
thyself
against
the
Lord
of

they
have
brought
the
vessels
of
his
house
before

thou

and
thy

drunk
wine
in

thou
hast
praised
the
gods

Then
was
the
part
of
the
hand
sent
from

this
writing
was
Dan5:25
And
this
is
the
writing
that
was
MENE,
MENE,
TEKEL,
UPHARSIN.
Dan5:26
This
is
the
interpretation
of
the
MENE;
God
hath
numbered

finished

TEKEL;
Thou
art
weighed
in

PERES;
Thy
kingdom
is

given

Medes
and

Then
commanded
and
they
clothed
Daniel
with
and
put
a
chain
of
gold
about
his
and
made
a
proclam

concerning
that
he
should
be

third
ruler
in

Dan5:30
In
that
night
was
Belshazzar
the
king
of
the
Chaldeans
Dan5:31
And
Darius
the
Median
took
the
being
about
threescore
and
two
years

It
pleased
Darius
to
set
over
the
kingdom
an
hundred

twenty
which
should
be
over
the
whole

And
over
these
three
of
whom
Daniel
was
that
the
princes
might
give
accounts
unto
and
the
king
shou

have
no

Then
this
Daniel
was
preferred
above
the
presidents
and
because
an
excellent
spirit
was
in
and
the
king
though
t
to
set
him
over
the
whole

Then
the
presidents

princes
sought
to
find
occasion
against

concerning

they
could
find
none
occa

nor
forasmuch
as
he
was
neither
was
there
any
error
or
fault
found
in

Then
said
these
We
shall
not
find
any
occasion
against
this
except
we
find
it
against
him
concerning

law
of

Dan6:6
Then
these
presidents
and
princes
assembled
together
to
the
and
said
thus
unto

All
the
presidents
of

Wherefore
king
Darius
signed
the
writing

the

Now
when
Daniel
knew
that
the
writing
was
he
went
into
his
and
his
windows
being
open
in
his
chamber
toward

kneeled
upon
his
knees
three
times
a

and
gave
thanks
before

he
did

Then
these
men

found
Daniel
praying
and
making
supplication
before

Dan6:12
Then
they
came
and
spake
before
the
king
concerning
the
king's
Hast
thou
not
signed
a
that
every
man
that
shall
ask
a
petition
of
any
God
or
man
within
thirty
save
of

shall
be
cast
into
the
den
of
The
king
answered
and
The
thing
is
according
to
the
law
of
the
Medes
and
which
altereth
Dan6:13
Then
answered
they
and
said
before
the
That
which
is
of
the
children
of
the
captivity
of
regardeth
not
O
nor
the
decree
that
thou
hast
but
maketh
his
petition
three
times
a
Dan6:14
Then
the
when
he
heard
these
was
sore
displeased
with
and
set
his
heart
on
Daniel
to
deliver
and
he
laboured
till
the
going
down
of
the
sun
to
deliver
Dan6:15
Then
these
men
assembled
unto
the
and
said
unto
the
O
that
the
law
of
the
Medes
and
Persians
Th
at
no
decree
nor
statute
which
the
king
establisheth
may
be
Dan6:16
Then
the
king
and
they
brought
and
cast
him
into
the
den
of
Now
the
king
spake
and
said
unto
Dani
Thy
God
whom
thou
servest
he
will
deliver
Dan6:17
And
a
stone
was
and
laid
upon
the
mouth
of
the
and
the
king
sealed
it
with
his
own
and
with
the
signe
t
of
his
that
the
purpose
might
not
be
changed
concerning
Dan6:18
Then
the
king
went
to
his
and
passed
the
night
neither
were
instruments
of
musick
brought
before
and
his
sleep
went
from
Dan6:19
Then
the
king
arose
very
early
in
the
and
went
in
haste
unto
the
den
of
Dan6:20
And
when
he
came
to
the
he
cried
with
a
lamentable
voice
unto
and
the
king
spake
and
said
to
O
servant
of
the
living
is
thy
whom
thou
servest
able
to
deliver
thee
from
the
Dan6:21
Then
said
Daniel
unto
the
O
live
for
Dan6:22
My
God
hath
sent
his
and
hath
shut
the
that
they
have
not
hurt
forasmuch
as
before
him
innocency
was
found
in
and
also
before
O
have
I
done
no
Dan6:23
Then
was
the
king
exceeding
glad
for
and
commanded
that
they
should
take
Daniel
up
out
of
the
So
Daniel
was
taken
up
out
of
the
and
no
manner
of
hurt
was
found
upon
because
he
believed
in
his
Dan6:24
And
the
king
and
they
brought
those
men
which
had
accused
and
they
cast
them
into
the
den
of
them
,
their
and
their
and
the
lions
had
the
mastery
of
and
brake
all
their
bones
in
pieces
or
ever
they
came
at
the
bottom
of
the
Dan6:25
Then
king
Darius
wrote
unto
all
and
that
dwell
in
all
the
Peace
be
multiplied
unto
Dan6:26
I
make
a
That
in
every
dominion
of
my
kingdom
men
tremble
and
fear
before
the
God
of
for
he
is
the
living
G
od,
and
stedfast
for
and
his
kingdom
that
which
shall
not
be
and
his
dominion
shall
be
even
unto
the
Dan6:27
He
delivereth
and
rescueth,
and
he
worketh
signs
and
wonders
in
heaven
and
in
who
hath
delivered
Daniel
from
the
pow
er
of
the
Dan6:28
So
this
Daniel
prospered
in
the
reign
of
and
in
the
reign
of
Cyrus

Dan7:1
In
the
first
year
of
Belshazzar
king
of
Babylon
Daniel
had
a
dream
and
visions
of
his
head
upon
his
then
he
wrote
the
d
and
told
the
sum
of
the
Dan7:2
Daniel
spake
and
I
saw
in
my
vision
by
the
four
winds
of
the
heaven
strove
upon
the
great
Dan7:3
And
four
great
beasts
came
up
from
the
diverse
one
from
Dan7:4
The
first
was
like
a
and
had
eagle's
I
beheld
till
the
wings
thereof
were
and
it
was
lifted
up
from
th
e
and
made
stand
upon
the
feet
as
a
and
a
man's
heart
was
given
to
Dan7:5
And
behold
another
a
like
to
a
and
it
raised
up
itself
on
one
and
it
had
three
ribs
in
the
mouth
of
it
between
the
teeth
of
and
they
said
thus
unto
devour
much
Dan7:6
After
this
I
and
lo
like
a
which
had
upon
the
back
of
it
four
wings
of
a
the
beast
had
also
four
and
dominion
was
given
to
Dan7:7
After
this
I
saw
in
the
night
and
behold
a
fourth
dreadful
and
and
strong
and
it
had
great
iron
it
devoured
and
brake
in
and
stamped
the
residue
with
the
feet
of
and
it
was
diverse
from
all
the
bea
sts
that
were
before
and
it
had
ten
Dan7:8
I
considered
the
there
came
up
among
them
another
little
before
whom
there
were
three
of
the
first
horns
plucked
up
by
the
in
this
horn
were
eyes
like
the
eyes
of
and
a
mouth
speaking
great
Dan7:9
I
beheld
till
the
thrones
were
cast
and
the
Ancient
of
days
did
whose
garment
was
white
as
and
the
hair
of
his
head
like
the
pure
his
throne
was
like
the
fiery
and
his
wheels
as
burning
Dan7:10
A
fiery
stream
issued
and
came
forth
from
before
thousand
thousands
ministered
unto
and
ten
thousand
times
ten
th
ousand
stood
before
the
judgment
was
and
the
books
were
Dan7:11
I
beheld
then
because
of
the
voice
of
the
great
words
which
the
horn
I
beheld
even
till
the
beast
was
and
his
body
and
given
to
the
burning
Dan7:12
As
concerning
the
rest
of
the
they
had
their
dominion
taken
yet
their
lives
were
prolonged
for
a
season
and
t
Dan7:13
I
saw
in
the
night
one
like
the
Son
of
man
came
with
the
clouds
of
and
came
to
the
Ancient
of
and
they
brought
him
near
before
Dan7:14
And
there
was
given
him
and
and
a
that
all
and
should
serve
his
dominion
is
an
everlasting
which
shall
not
pass
and
his
kingdom
that
which
shall
not
be
Dan7:15
I
Daniel
was
grieved
in
my
spirit
in
the
midst
of
my
and
the
visions
of
my
head
troubled
Dan7:16
I
came
near
unto
one
of
them
that
stood
and
asked
him
the
truth
of
all
So
he
told
and
made
me
know
the
interp
retation
of
the
Dan7:17
These
great
which
are
are
four
which
shall
arise
out
of
the
Dan7:18
But
the
saints
of
the
most
High
shall
take
the
and
possess
the
kingdom
for
even
for
ever
and
Dan7:19
Then
I
would
know
the
truth
of
the
fourth
which
was
diverse
from
all
the
exceeding
whose
teeth
wer
e
of
and
his
nails
of
which
brake
in
and
stamped
the
residue
with
his
Dan7:20
And
of
the
ten
horns
that
were
in
his
and
of
the
other
which
came
and
before
whom
three
even
of
that
horn
t
hat
had
and
a
mouth
that
spake
very
great
whose
look
was
more
stout
than
his
Dan7:21
I
and
the
same
horn
made
war
with
the
and
prevailed
against
Dan7:22
Until
the
Ancient
of
days
and
judgment
was
given
to
the
saints
of
the
most
and
the
time
came
that
the
saints
po
ssessed
the
Dan7:23
Thus
he
The
fourth
beast
shall
be
the
fourth
kingdom
upon
which
shall
be
diverse
from
all
and
shall
devour
the
whole
and
shall
tread
it
and
break
it
in
Dan7:24
And
the
ten
horns
out
of
this
kingdom
are
ten
kings
that
shall
and
another
shall
rise
after
and
he
shall
be
di
verse
from
the
and
he
shall
subdue
three
Dan7:25
And
he
shall
speak
great
words
against
the
most
and
shall
wear
out
the
saints
of
the
most
and
think
to
change
t
imes
and
and
they
shall
be
given
into
his
hand
until
a
time
and
times
and
the
dividing
of
Dan7:26
But
the
judgment
shall
and
they
shall
take
away
his
to
consume
and
to
destroy
it
unto
the
Dan7:27
And
the
kingdom
and
and
the
greatness
of
the
kingdom
under
the
whole
shall
be
given
to
the
people
of
the
saints
of
the
most
whose
kingdom
is
an
everlasting
and
all
dominions
shall
serve
and
obey
Dan7:28
Hitherto
is
the
end
of
the
As
for
me
my
cogitations
much
troubled
and
my
countenance
changed
in
but
I
kept
the
matter
in
my
Dan8:1
In
the
third
year
of
the
reign
of
king
Belshazzar
a
vision
appeared
unto
even
unto
me
after
that
which
appeared
unto
me
at
the
Dan8:2
And
I
saw
in
a
and
it
came
to
when
I
that
I
was
at
Shushan
in
the
which
is
in
the
province
of
Ela
m;
and
I
saw
in
a
and
I
was
by
the
river
of
Ulai.
Dan8:3
Then
I
lifted
up
mine
and
there
stood
before
the
river
a
ram
which
had
two
and
the
two
horns
were
but
one
was
higher
than
the
and
the
higher
came
up
Dan8:4
I
saw
the
ram
pushing
and
and
so
that
no
beasts
might
stand
before
neither
was
there
an
y
that
could
deliver
out
of
his
but
he
did
according
to
his
and
became
Dan8:5
And
as
I
was
an
he
goat
came
from
the
west
on
the
face
of
the
whole
and
touched
not
the
and
the
goat
had
a
notable
horn
between
his
Dan8:6
And
he
came
to
the
ram
that
had
two
which
I
had
seen
standing
before
the
and
ran
unto
him
in
the
fury
of
his
p
ower.
Dan8:7
And
I
saw
him
come
close
unto
the
and
he
was
moved
with
choler
against
and
smote
the
and
brake
his
two
and
there
was
no
power
in
the
ram
to
stand
before
but
he
cast
him
down
to
the
and
stamped
upon
and
there
was
non
e
that
could
deliver
the
ram
out
of
his
Dan8:8
Therefore
the
he
goat
waxed
very
and
when
he
was
the
great
horn
was
and
for
it
came
up
four
notable
o
nes
toward
the
four
winds
of
Dan8:9
And
out
of
one
of
them
came
forth
a
little
which
waxed
exceeding
toward
the
and
toward
the
and
tow
ard
the
pleasant
Dan8:10
And
it
waxed
even
to
the
host
of
and
it
cast
down
some
of
the
host
and
of
the
stars
to
the
and
stamp
ed
upon
Dan8:11
he
magnified
himself
even
to
the
prince
of
the
and
by
him
the
daily
sacrifice
was
taken
and
the
place
of
h
is
sanctuary
was
cast
Dan8:12
And
an
host
was
given
him
against
the
daily
sacrifice
by
reason
of
and
it
cast
down
the
truth
to
the
and
it
and
Dan8:13
Then
I
heard
one
saint
and
another
saint
said
unto
that
certain
saint
which
How
long
shall
be
the
vision
c
oncerning
the
daily
and
the
transgression
of
to
give
both
the
sanctuary
and
the
host
to
be
trodden
under
foo
t?
Dan8:14
And
he
said
unto
Unto
two
thousand
and
three
hundred
then
shall
the
sanctuary
be
Dan8:15
And
it
came
to
when
even
I
had
seen
the
and
sought
for
the
there
stood
befo
re
me
as
the
appearance
of
a
Dan8:16
And
I
heard
a
man's
voice
between
the
banks
of
Ulai,
which
and
make
this
man
to
understand
the
visio
n.
Dan8:17
So
he
came
near
where
I
and
when
he
I
was
and
fell
upon
my
but
he
said
unto
O
so
n
of
for
at
the
time
of
the
end
shall
be
the
Dan8:18
Now
as
he
was
speaking
with
I
was
in
a
deep
sleep
on
my
face
toward
the
but
he
touched
and
set
me
Dan8:19
And
he
I
will
make
thee
know
what
shall
be
in
the
last
end
of
the
for
at
the
time
appointed
the
end
shall
Dan8:20
The
ram
which
thou
sawest
having
two
horns
are
the
kings
of
Media
and
Dan8:21
And
the
rough
goat
is
the
king
of
Grecia:
and
the
great
horn
that
is
between
his
eyes
is
the
first
Dan8:22
Now
that
being
whereas
four
stood
up
for
four
kingdoms
shall
stand
up
out
of
the
but
not
in
his
Dan8:23
And
in
the
latter
time
of
their
when
the
transgressors
are
come
to
the
a
king
of
fierce
and
und
erstanding
dark
shall
stand
Dan8:24
And
his
power
shall
be
but
not
by
his
own
and
he
shall
destroy
and
shall
and
and
shall
destroy
the
mighty
and
the
holy
Dan8:25
And
through
his
policy
also
he
shall
cause
craft
to
prosper
in
his
and
he
shall
magnify
himself
in
his
and
by
peace
shall
destroy
he
shall
also
stand
up
against
the
Prince
of
but
he
shall
be
broken
without
Dan8:26
And
the
vision
of
the
evening
and
the
morning
which
was
told
is
wherefore
shut
thou
up
the
for
it
shall
be
fo
r
many
Dan8:27
And
I
Daniel
and
was
sick
certain
afterward
I
rose
and
did
the
king's
and
I
was
astonished
at
the
but
none
understood

In
the
first
year
of
Darius

son
of

was
made
king
over

In

first

Daniel
understood
by
books

number
of

whereof

LORD
came
to
Je
remiah
the
that
he
would
accomplish
seventy
years
in
the
desolations
of

And
I
set
my
face
unto
the
Lord
to
seek
by
prayer
and
supplications,
with
and
and
Dan9:4
And
I
prayed
unto
the
LORD
my

made

In
the
third
year
of
Cyrus
king
of
Persia
a
thing
was
revealed
unto
whose
name
was
called
Belteshazzar;
and
the
thi
ng
was
but
the
time
appointed
was
and
he
understood
the
and
had
understanding
of
the
Dan10:2
In
those
days
I
Daniel
was
mourning
three
full
Dan10:3
I
ate
no
pleasant
neither
came
flesh
nor
wine
in
my
neither
did
I
anoint
myself
at
till
three
whole

s
were
Dan10:4
And
in
the
four
and
twentieth
day
of
the
first
as
I
was
by
the
side
of
the
great
which
is
Hiddekel;
Dan10:5
Then
I
lifted
up
mine
and
and
behold
a
certain
man
clothed
in
whose
loins
were
girded
with
fine
gold
o
f
Uphaz:
Dan10:6
His
body
also
was
like
the
and
his
face
as
the
appearance
of
and
his
eyes
as
lamps
of
and
his
arms
and
his
feet
like
in
colour
to
polished
and
the
voice
of
his
words
like
the
voice
of
a
Dan10:7
And
I
Daniel
alone
saw
the
for
the
men
that
were
with
me
saw
not
the
but
a
great
quaking
fell
upon
so
that
they
fled
to
hide
Dan10:8
Therefore
I
was
left
and
saw
this
great
and
there
remained
no
strength
in
for
my
comeliness
was
turned
i
n
me
into
and
I
retained
no
Dan10:9
Yet
heard
I
the
voice
of
his
and
when
I
heard
the
voice
of
his
then
was
I
in
a
deep
sleep
on
my
and
my
face
toward
the
Dan10:10
an
hand
touched
which
set
me
upon
my
knees
and
upon
the
palms
of
my
Dan10:11
And
he
said
unto
O
a
man
greatly
understand
the
words
that
I
speak
unto
and
stand
for
unto
thee
am
I
now
And
when
he
had
spoken
this
word
unto
I
stood
Dan10:12
Then
said
he
unto
Fear
for
from
the
first
day
that
thou
didst
set
thine
heart
to
and
to
chast
en
thyself
before
thy
thy
words
were
and
I
am
come
for
thy
Dan10:13
But
the
prince
of
the
kingdom
of
Persia
withstood
me
one
and
twenty
one
of
the
chief
came
to
help
and
I
remained
there
with
the
kings
of
Dan10:14
Now
I
am
come
to
make
thee
understand
what
shall
befall
thy
people
in
the
latter
for
yet
the
vision
is
for
many
days
.
Dan10:15
And
when
he
had
spoken
such
words
unto
I
set
my
face
toward
the
and
I
became
Dan10:16
one
like
the
similitude
of
the
sons
of
men
touched
my
then
I
opened
my
and
and
said
unto
him
that
stood
before
O
my
by
the
vision
my
sorrows
are
turned
upon
and
I
have
retained
no
Dan10:17
For
how
can
the
servant
of
this
my
lord
talk
with
this
my
for
as
for
straightway
there
remained
no
strength
in
m
e,
neither
is
there
breath
left
in
Dan10:18
Then
there
came
again
and
touched
me
one
like
the
appearance
of
a
and
he
strengthened
Dan10:19
And
O
man
greatly
fear
peace
be
unto
be
be
And
when
he
had
spoken
unto
I
was
and
Let
my
lord
for
thou
hast
strengthened
Dan10:20
Then
said
Knowest
thou
wherefore
I
come
unto
and
now
will
I
return
to
fight
with
the
prince
of

when
I
am
gone
the
prince
of
Grecia
shall

But
I
will
shew
thee
that
which
is
noted
in
the
scripture
of

there
is
none
that
holdeth
with
me
in
these
things
,
but
Michael

Also
I
in
the
first
year
of
Darius
the
even
stood
to
confirm
and
to
strengthen
Dan11:2
And
now
will
I
shew
thee
the
there
shall
stand
up
yet
three
kings
in
and
the
fourth
shall
be
far
ric
her
than
they
and
by
his
strength
through
his
riches
he
shall
stir
up
all
against
the
realm
of
Grecia.
Dan11:3
And
a
mighty
king
shall
stand
that
shall
rule
with
great
and
do
according
to
his
Dan11:4
And
when
he
shall
stand
his
kingdom
shall
be
and
shall
be
divided
toward
the
four
winds
of

not
to

is
nor
according
to
his
dominion
which
he
for
his
kingdom
shall
be
plucked
even
for
others
beside
Dan11:5
And
the
king
of
the
south
shall
be
and
one
of
his
and
he
shall
be
strong
above
and
have
his
dominion
shall
be
a
great
Dan11:6
And
in
the
end
of
years
they
shall
join
themselves
for
the
king's
daughter
of
the
south
shall
come
to
the
king
of

north
to
make

she
shall
not
retain
the
power
of

shall
he
nor
his
but
she
shall
be
given
and
they
that
brought
and
he
that
begat
and
he
that
strengthened
her
in
these
Dan11:7
But
out
of
a
branch
of
her
roots
shall
one
stand
up
in
his
which
shall
come
with
an
and
shall
enter
into
the
fortress
of
the
king
of

shall
deal
against

And
shall
also
carry
captives
into
Egypt
their
with
their
and
with
their
precious
vessels
of
silver
and
of
g
and
he
shall
continue
more
years
than
the
king
of
the
Dan11:9
So
the
king
of
the
south
shall
come
into
his
and
shall
return
into
his
own
Dan11:10
But
his
sons
shall
be
stirred
and
shall
assemble
a
multitude
of
great
and
one
shall
certainly
and
overfl
and
pass
then
shall
he
and
be
stirred
even
to
his
Dan11:11
And
the
king
of
the
south
shall
be
moved
with

shall
come
forth
and
fight
with
even
with
the
king
of
the

orth:
and
he
shall
set
forth
a
great
but
the
multitude
shall
be
given
into
his
Dan11:12
And
when
he
hath
taken
away
the
his
heart
shall
be
lifted
and
he
shall
cast
down
many
ten
but
he
shall
not
be
strengthened
by
Dan11:13
For
the
king
of
the
north
shall
and
shall
set
forth
a
multitude
greater
than
the
and
shall
certainly
come
after
certain
years
with
a
great
army
and
with
much
Dan11:14
And
in
those
times
there
shall
many
stand
up
against
the
king
of

also
the
robbers
of
thy
people
shall
exalt
the

to
establish

they
shall
Dan11:15
So
the
king
of
the
north
shall
and
cast
up
a

take
the
most
fenced
and
the
arms
of
the
south
shall
not
neither
his
chosen
neither
shall
there
be
any
strength
to
Dan11:16
But
he
that
cometh
against
him
shall
do
according
to
his
own
and
none
shall
stand
before
and
he
shall
stand
in
the
glorious
which
by
his
hand
shall
be
Dan11:17
He
shall
also
set
his
face
to
enter
with
the
strength
of
his
whole
and
upright
ones
with

shall
he
a

he
shall
give
him
the
daughter
of
corrupting
but
she
shall
not
stand
on

neither
be
for

After
this
shall
he
turn
his
face
unto
the
and
shall
take
but
a
prince
for
his
own
behalf
shall
cause
the
rep
roach
offered
by
him
to
without
his
own
reproach
he
shall
cause
it
to
turn
upon
Dan11:19
Then
he
shall
turn
his
face
toward
the
fort
of
his
own
but
he
shall
stumble
and
and
not
be
Dan11:20
Then
shall
stand
up
in
his
estate
a
raiser
of
taxes
in
the
glory
of
the
but
within
few
days
he
shall
be
destroyed

neither

And
in
his
estate
shall
stand
up
a
vile

whom
they
shall
not
give
the
honour
of

he
shall
come

obtain
the
kingdom
by
flatteries.
Dan11:22
And
with
the
arms
of
a
flood
shall
they
be
overflown
from

shall
be
also
the
prince
of

Dan11:23
And
after
the
league
made
with

he
shall
work
for
he
shall
come
and
shall
become
strong
with
a
small
p

Dan11:24
He
shall
enter
peaceably

upon

fattest
places

the
king
of

be
stirred
up
to

fall
down

And
both
these
hearts

speak

at

but
it

Then

he
return
into

he
shall
do

At
the
time
appointed
he
shall
and
come
toward

it
shall
not
be
as
the

For
the
ships

have
indignation
against

And
such
as

wickedly
against

corrupt
by
flatteries:
but
the
people
that
do
know
their
God

And
they
that

Now
when

Dan11:36
And
the
king
shall
do
according
to
his
and
he
shall
exalt
and
magnify
himself
above

shall
sp
eak
marvellous
things
against

God
of

shall
prosper
till
the
indignation
be

Neither

he
regard

God
of

desire
of

regard
any

shall
magnify
himself
above
Dan11:38
But
in
his
estate
shall
he
honour
the
God
of

a
god
whom
his
fathers
knew
not
shall
he
honour
with

Thus

most
strong

But

And

And

But
prophesy

to
Amaziah,

sayest,
Prophesy
not
against

drop
not
thy

Therefore
thus
saith
the

thy
land
shall
be
divided
by

thou
shalt
die
in
a
polluted

Israel
shall
surely
go
into
captivity
forth
of
his
Amos8:1
Thus
hath
the
Lord
GOD
shewed
unto

That

laid

Who
can
tell

Jonah3:10
And
God
saw

they
turned

God
repented
of

he
had
said
that

he
did
it
Jonah4:1
But
it
displeased

he
was
very

he
prayed
unto

I
pray

better

Then
said

So
Jonah
went
out
of

sat
on

east

there
made

sat

made

Because

If

and
so

And

sitteth
and
is
at
Zec1:12
Then
the
angel
of
the
LORD
answered
and
O
LORD
of
how
long
wilt
thou
not
have
mercy
on
Jerusalem
and
on
the
ci
ties
of
against
which
thou
hast
had
indignation
these
threescore
and
ten
Zec1:13
And
the
LORD
answered
the
angel
that
talked
with
me
with
good
words
and
comfortable
Zec1:14
So
the
angel
that
communed
with
me
said
unto
Cry
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
I
am
jealous
for
Jerusalem
and
for
Zion
with
a
great
Zec1:15
And
I
am
very
sore
displeased
with
the
heathen
that
are
at
for
I
was
but
a
little
and
they
helped
forward
the
Zec1:16
Therefore
thus
saith
the
I
am
returned
to
Jerusalem
with
my
house
shall
be
built
in
saith
the
LORD
of
ho
sts,
and
a
line
shall
be
stretched
forth
upon
Zec1:17
Cry
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
My
cities
through
prosperity
shall
yet
be
spread
and
the
LORD
shall
yet
comfort
and
shall
yet
choose
Zec1:18
Then
lifted
I
up
mine
and
and
behold
four
Zec1:19
And
I
said
unto
the
angel
that
talked
with
What
be
And
he
answered
These
are
the
horns
which
have
scattered
and
Zec1:20
And
the
LORD
shewed
me
four
Zec1:21
Then
said
What
come
these
to
And
he
These
are
the
horns
which
have
scattered
so
that
no
man
di
d
lift
up

but
these
are
come
to
fray
to
cast
out
the
horns
of
the
which
lifted
up
their
horn
over
the
lan
d
of
Judah
to
scatter
Zec2:1
I
lifted
up
mine
eyes
and
and
behold
a
man
with
a
measuring
line
in
his
Zec2:2
Then
said
Whither
goest
And
he
said
unto
To
measure
to
see
what
is
the
breadth
and
what
is
the
length
Zec2:3
the
angel
that
talked
with
me
went
and
another
angel
went
out
to
meet
Zec2:4
And
said
unto
speak
to
this
young
Jerusalem
shall
be
inhabited
as
towns
without
walls
for
the
multitu
de
of
men
and
cattle
Zec2:5
For
saith
the
will
be
unto
her
a
wall
of
fire
round
and
will
be
the
glory
in
the
midst
of
Zec2:6
come
and
flee
from

Zec2:7
Deliver
O
that

For
thus
saith
the
LORD
of
After
the
glory
hath
he
sent
me
unto
the
nations
which
spoiled
for
he
that
toucheth

the
apple
of

I
will
shake
mine
hand
upon

they
shall
be
a
spoil
to
their

ye
shall
know
that
the
LORD
of

hath
sent
Zec2:10
Sing
and
O
daughter
of
I
and
I
will
dwell
in
the
midst

the
Zec2:11
And
many
nations
shall
be
joined
to
the
LORD
in
that
and

I
will
dwell
in
the
midst

that
the
LORD
of

me
unto
Zec2:12
And
the
LORD
shall
inherit
Judah
his
portion
in
the
holy
and
shall
choose
Jerusalem
Zec2:13
Be
O
all
before

he
is
raised
up
out
of
his
holy

And
he
shewed
me
Joshua
the
high
priest
standing
before
the
angel
of
the
and
Satan
standing
at
his
right
hand
to

Now
Joshua
was
clothed
with
filthy
and
stood
before
the
Zec3:4
And
he
answered
and
spake
unto
those
that
stood
before
Take
away
the
filthy
garments
from
And
unto
him
he
I
have
caused
thine
iniquity
to
pass

and
I
will
clothe
thee
with

And
I
Let

So
they
set
a
fair
mitre
upon
his
and
clothed
him
with
And
the
angel
of
the
LORD
stood
Zec3:6
And
the
angel
of
the
LORD
protested
unto
Zec3:7
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
If
thou
wilt
walk
in
my

if
thou

thou

also
keep

I
will
give
thee
places
to

Hear
O
Joshua
the
high
and
thy
fellows
that
sit
before

they
are

wondered
I
will
bring
forth
my
servant

Zec3:9
For
behold
the
stone
that
I
have
laid
before
upon
one
stone

be

I
will
engrave
the
graving

the
LORD
of
and
I
will
remove
the
iniquity
of
that
land
in

Zec3:10
In
that

the
LORD
of
shall
ye
call
every
man
his
neighbour
under
the
vine
and
under
the
fig
Zec4:1
And
the
angel
that
talked
with
me
came
and
waked
as
a
man
that
is
wakened
out
of
his
Zec4:2
And
said
unto
What
seest
And
I
I
have
and
behold
a
candlestick
all
of
with
a
bowl
upon
the
top
of
and
his
seven
lamps
and
seven
pipes
to
the
seven
which
are
upon
the
top
Zec4:3
And
two
olive
trees
by
one
upon
the
right
side
of
the
and
the
other
upon
the
left
side
Zec4:4
So
I
answered
and
spake
to
the
angel
that
talked
with
What
are
my
Zec4:5
Then
the
angel
that
talked
with
me
answered
and
said
unto
Knowest
thou
not
what
these
And
I
my
Zec4:6
Then
he
answered
and
spake
unto
This
is
the
word
of
the
LORD
unto
Zerubbabel,
Not
by
nor
by
power
,
but
by
my
saith
the
LORD
of
Zec4:7
Who
art
O
great
before
Zerubbabel
thou
shalt
become
a
and
he
shall
bring
forth
the
headstone
thereof
with
shoutings,
grace
unto
Zec4:8
Moreover
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
Zec4:9
The
hands
of
Zerubbabel
have
laid
the
foundation
of
this
his
hands
shall
also
finish
and
thou
shalt
know
that
the
LORD
of
hosts
hath
sent
me
unto
Zec4:10
For
who
hath
despised
the
day
of
small
for
they
shall
and
shall
see
the
plummet
in
the
hand
of
Zerubbabel
with
those
they
are
the
eyes
of
the
which
run
to
and
fro
through
the
whole
Zec4:11
Then
answered
and
said
unto
What
are
these
two
olive
trees
upon
the
right
side
of
the
candlestick
and
upon
the
left
side
Zec4:12
And
I
answered
and
said
unto
What
be
these
two
olive
branches
which
through
the
two
golden
pipes
empty
the
gold
en
oil
out
of
Zec4:13
And
he
answered
me
and
Knowest
thou
not
what
these
And
I
my
Zec4:14
Then
said
These
are
the
two
anointed
that
stand
by
the
LORD
of
the
whole
Zec5:1
Then
I
and
lifted
up
mine
and
and
behold
a
flying
Zec5:2
And
he
said
unto
What
seest
And
I
I
see
a
flying
the
length
thereof
is
twenty
cubits,
and
the
brea
dth
thereof
ten
cubits.
Zec5:3
Then
said
he
unto
This
is
the
curse
that
goeth
forth
over
the
face
of
the
whole
for
every
one
that
stealeth
shall
be
cut
off
as
on
this
side
according
to
and
every
one
that
sweareth
shall
be
cut
off
as
on
that
side
according
to
Zec5:4
I
will
bring
it
saith
the
LORD
of
and
it
shall
enter
into
the
house
of
the
and
into
the
house
of
him
th
at
sweareth
falsely
by
my
and
it
shall
remain
in
the
midst
of
his
and
shall
consume
it
with
the
timber
thereof
and
the
stones
Zec5:5
Then
the
angel
that
talked
with
me
went
and
said
unto
Lift
up
now
thine
and
see
what
is
this
that
goeth
for
Zec5:6
And
I
What
is
And
he
This
is
an
ephah
that
goeth
He
said
This
is
their
resemblance
through
all
the
Zec5:7
there
was
lifted
up
a
talent
of
and
this
is
a
woman
that
sitteth
in
the
midst
of
the
Zec5:8
And
he
This
is
And
he
cast
it
into
the
midst
of
the
and
he
cast
the
weight
of
lead
upon
the
mouth
t
Zec5:9
Then
lifted
I
up
mine
and
there
came
out
two
and
the
wind
was
in
their
for
they
had
wings
like
the
wings
of
a
and
they
lifted
up
the
ephah
between
the
earth
and
the
Zec5:10
Then
said
I
to
the
angel
that
talked
with
Whither
do
these
bear
the
Zec5:11
And
he
said
unto
To
build
it
an
house
in
the
land
of
and
it
shall
be
and
set
there
upon
her
own
ba
Zec6:1
And
I
and
lifted
up
mine
and
there
came
four
chariots
out
from
between
two
and
the
mountains
were
mountains
of
Zec6:2
In
the
first
chariot
were
red
and
in
the
second
chariot
black
Zec6:3
And
in
the
third
chariot
white
and
in
the
fourth
chariot
grisled
and
bay
Zec6:4
Then
I
answered
and
said
unto
the
angel
that
talked
with
What
are
my
Zec6:5
And
the
angel
answered
and
said
unto
These
are
the
four
spirits
of
the
which
go
forth
from
standing
before
the
LORD
of
all
the
Zec6:6
The
black
horses
which
are
therein
go
forth
into
the
north
and
the
white
go
forth
after
and
the
grisled
go
fo
rth
toward
the
south
Zec6:7
And
the
bay
went
and
sought
to
go
that
they
might
walk
to
and
fro
through
the
and
he
Get
you
walk
to
and
fro
through
the
So
they
walked
to
and
fro
through
the
Zec6:8
Then
cried
he
upon
and
spake
unto
these
that
go
toward
the
north
country
have
quieted
my
spirit
in
t
he
north
Zec6:9
And
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
Zec6:10
Take
of
them
of
the
even
of
Heldai,
of
Tobijah,
and
of
Jedaiah,
which
are
come
from
and
come
thou
the
s
ame
and
go
into
the
house
of
Josiah
the
son
of
Zec6:11
Then
take
silver
and
and
make
and
set
them
upon
the
head
of
Joshua
the
son
of
Josedech,
the
high
Zec6:12
And
speak
unto
Thus
speaketh
the
LORD
of
Behold
the
man
whose
name
is
The
and
he
shall
grow
up
out
of
his
and
he
shall
build
the
temple
of
the
Zec6:13
Even
he
shall
build
the
temple
of
the
and
he
shall
bear
the
and
shall
sit
and
rule
upon
his
and
he
sha

be
a
priest
upon
his
and
the
counsel
of
peace
shall
be
between
them
Zec6:14
And
the
crowns
shall
be
to
Helem,
and
to
Tobijah,
and
to
Jedaiah,
and
to
Hen
the
son
of
for
a
memorial
in
the
te
mple
of
the
Zec6:15
And
they
that
are
far
off
shall
come
and
build
in
the
temple
of
the
and
ye
shall
know
that
the
LORD
of
hosts
hath
sen
t
me
unto
And
this
shall
come
to
if
ye
will
diligently
obey
the
voice
of
the
LORD
your
Zec7:1
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
fourth
year
of
king
that
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
Zechariah
in
the
fourth
day
of
th
e
ninth
even
in
Chisleu;
Zec7:2
When
they
had
sent
unto
the
house
of
God
Sherezer
and
Regemmelech,
and
their
to
pray
before
the
Zec7:3
And
to
speak
unto
the
priests
which
were
in
the
house
of
the
LORD
of
and
to
the
Should
I
weep
in
th
e
fifth
separating
as
I
have
done
these
so
many
Zec7:4
Then
came
the
word
of
the
LORD
of
hosts
unto
Zec7:5
Speak
unto
all
the
people
of
the
and
to
the
When
ye
fasted
and
mourned
in
the
fifth
and
seventh
month
,
even
those
seventy
did
ye
at
all
fast
unto
even
to
Zec7:6
And
when
ye
did
and
when
ye
did
did
not
ye
eat
for
and
drink
for
Zec7:7
Should
ye
not
hear
the
words
which
the
LORD
hath
cried
by
the
former
when
Jerusalem
was
inhabited
and
in
prosperit
y,
and
the
cities
thereof
round
about
when
men
inhabited
the
south
and
the
Zec7:8
And
the
word
of
the
LORD
came
unto
Zec7:9
Thus
speaketh
the
LORD
of
Execute
true
and
shew
mercy
and
compassions
every
man
to
his
Zec7:10
And
oppress
not
the
nor
the
the
nor
the
and
let
none
of
you
imagine
evil
against
his
bro
ther
in
your
Zec7:11
But
they
refused
to
and
pulled
away
the
and
stopped
their
that
they
should
not
Zec7:12
they
made
their
hearts
as
an
adamant
lest
they
should
hear
the
and
the
words
which
the
LORD
of
hosts
hath
sent
in
his
spirit
by
the
former
therefore
came
a
great
wrath
from
the
LORD
of
Zec7:13
Therefore
it
is
come
to
that
as
he
and
they
would
not
so
they
and
I
would
not
saith
the
LOR
D
of
Zec7:14
But
I
scattered
them
with
a
whirlwind
among
all
the
nations
whom
they
knew
Thus
the
land
was
desolate
after
that
no
man
passed
through
nor
for
they
laid
the
pleasant
land
Zec8:1
Again
the
word
of
the
LORD
of
hosts
came
to
Zec8:2
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
I
was
jealous
for
Zion
with
great
and
I
was
jealous
for
her
with
great
Zec8:3
Thus
saith
the
I
am
returned
unto
and
will
dwell
in
the
midst
of
and
Jerusalem
shall
be
called
a
city
of
and
the
mountain
of
the
LORD
of
hosts
the
holy
Zec8:4
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
There
shall
yet
old
men
and
old
women
dwell
in
the
streets
of
and
every
man
with
hi
s
staff
in
his
hand
for
very
Zec8:5
And
the
streets
of
the
city
shall
be
full
of
boys
and
girls
playing
in
the
streets
Zec8:6
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
If
it
be
marvellous
in
the
eyes
of
the
remnant
of
this
people
in
these
should
it
also
be
marvellous
in
mine
saith
the
LORD
of
Zec8:7
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
I
will
save
my
people
from
the
east
and
from
the
west
Zec8:8
And
I
will
bring
and
they
shall
dwell
in
the
midst
of
and
they
shall
be
my
and
I
will
be
their
in
truth
and
in
Zec8:9
Thus
saith
the
LORD
of
Let
your
hands
be
ye
that
hear
in
these
days
these
words
by
the
mouth
of
the
which
were
in
the
day
that
the
foundation
of
the
house
of
the
LORD
of
hosts
was
that
the
temple
might
be
Zec8:10
For
before
these
days
there
was
no
hire
for
nor
any
hire
for
neither
was
there
any
peace
to
him
that
went
out
o
r
came
in
because
of
the
for
I
set
all
men
every
one
against
his
Zec8:11
But
now
I
will
not
be
unto
the
residue
of
this
people
as
in
the
former
saith
the
LORD
of
Zec8:12
For
the
seed
shall
be
the
vine
shall
give
her
and
the
ground
shall
give
her
and
the
heavens
sh
all
give
their
and
I
will
cause
the
remnant
of
this
people
to
possess
all
these
Zec8:13
And
it
shall
come
to
that
as
ye
were
a
curse
among
the
O
house
of
and
house
of
so
will
I
save
and
ye
shall
be
a
fear
but
let
your
hands
be
Zec8:14
For
thus
saith
the
LORD
of
As
I
thought
to
punish
when
your
fathers
provoked
me
to
saith
the
LORD
of
hos
ts,
and

the

When
as
his

was

to

she

not

when

in

And
when

demanded
of
them
where
Christ
should

And
they
said
unto
In
Bethlehem

thus
it
is
written
by

And

of
Juda:
for
out
of

Then
when
he
had
privily
called

of
them
diligently

And
he
sent

When

And

Then
when
he
saw
that
he
was
mocked
of

exceeding
and
sent

slew
all
the
children
that
were

according
to
the
time
which
he
had
diligently
enquired

Then
was
fulfilled
that
which
was
spoken
by
Jeremy
the
Mat2:18
In
Rama
was
there
a
voice
and
and
great
Rachel
weeping
for

But
when
Herod
was
an
angel
of

Lord
appeareth
in
a
dream
to
Joseph
in
Mat2:20
and
take
the
young
child

and
go
into

land
of

they
are
dead
which
sought
the
young
child's
Mat2:21
And
he
and
took
the
young
child
and
his
and
came
into
the
land
of
Mat2:22
But
when
he
heard
that
Archelaus
did
reign
in
Judaea
in
the
room
of
his
father
he
was
afraid
to
go
notwiths
tanding,
being
warned
of
God
in
a
he
turned
aside
into
the
parts
of
Mat2:23
And
he
came
and
dwelt
in
a
city
called
that
it
might
be
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
by
the
He

Mat3:1
In
those
days
came
John
the
preaching
in
the
wilderness
of
Mat3:2
And
Repent
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
at
Mat3:3
For
this
is
he
that
was
spoken
of
by
the
prophet
Esaias,
The
voice
of
one
crying
in
the
Prepare
ye
the
w
ay
of
the
make
his
paths
Mat3:4
And
the
same
John
had
his
raiment
of
camel's
and
a
leathern
girdle
about
his
and
his
meat
was
locusts
and
wild
Mat3:5
Then
went
out
to
him
and
all
and
all
the
region
round
about
Mat3:6
And
were
baptized
of
him
in
confessing
their
Mat3:7
But
when
he
saw
many
of
the
Pharisees
and
Sadducees
come
to
his
he
said
unto
O
generation
of
who
hath
warned
you
to
flee
from
the
wrath
to
Mat3:8
Bring
forth
therefore
fruits
meet
for
Mat3:9
And
think
not
to
say
within
We
have
Abraham
to
our
for
I
say
unto
that
God
is
able
of
these
stones
to
raise
up
children
unto
Mat3:10
And
now
also
the
axe
is
laid
unto
the
root
of
the
therefore
every
tree
which
bringeth
not
forth
good
fruit
is
hewn
d
and
cast
into
the
Mat3:11
I
indeed
baptize
you
with
water
unto
but
he
that
cometh
after
me
is
mightier
than
whose
shoes
I
am
not
worth
y
to
he
shall
baptize
you
with
the
Holy
and
with
Mat3:12
Whose
fan
is
in
his
and
he
will
throughly
purge
his
and
gather
his
wheat
into
the
but
he
will
burn
up
the
chaff
with
unquenchable
Mat3:13
Then
cometh
Jesus
from
Galilee
to
Jordan
unto
to
be
baptized
of
Mat3:14
But
John
forbad
I
have
need
to
be
baptized
of
and
comest
thou
to
Mat3:15
And
Jesus
answering
said
unto
Suffer
it
to
be
so
for
thus
it
becometh
us
to
fulfil
all
Then
he
suf
fered
Mat3:16
And
when
he
was
went
up
straightway
out
of
the
the
heavens
were
opened
unto
and
he
sa
w
the
Spirit
of
God
descending
like
a
and
lighting
upon
Mat3:17
And
lo
a
voice
from
This
is
my
beloved
in
whom
I
am
well
Mat4:1
Then
was
Jesus
led
up
of
the
Spirit
into
the
wilderness
to
be
tempted
of
the
Mat4:2
And
when
he
had
fasted
forty
days
and
forty
he
was
afterward
an
hungred.
Mat4:3
And
when
the
tempter
came
to
he
If
thou
be
the
Son
of
command
that
these
stones
be
made
Mat4:4
But
he
answered
and
It
is
Man
shall
not
live
by
bread
but
by
every
word
that
proceedeth
out
of
the
mou
th
of
Mat4:5
Then
the
devil
taketh
him
up
into
the
holy
and
setteth
him
on
a
pinnacle
of
the
Mat4:6
And
saith
unto
If
thou
be
the
Son
of
cast
thyself
for
it
is
He
shall
give
his
angels
charge

and
in
their
hands
they
shall
bear
thee
lest
at
any
time
thou
dash
thy
foot
against

Jesus
said
unto
It
is
written
Thou
shalt
not
tempt

Lord

the
devil
taketh
him
up
into
an
exceeding
high
and
sheweth
him
all
the
kingdoms
of

and
the
glory
of
Mat4:9
And
saith
unto
All
these
things
will
I
give
if
thou
wilt
fall
down
and
worship

Then
saith
Jesus
unto
Get
thee
for
it
is
Thou
shalt
worship
the
Lord

and
him
only

Then
the
devil

came
and
ministered
unto
Mat4:12
Now
when
Jesus
had
heard
that
John
was
cast
into
he
departed
into
Mat4:13
And
leaving
he
came
and
dwelt
in
which
is
upon
the
sea
in
the
borders
of
Zabulon
and
Nephthalim
:
Mat4:14
That
it
might
be
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
by
Esaias
the
Mat4:15
The
land
of
Zabulon,
and
the
land
of
Nephthalim,
by
the
way
of
the
beyond
Galilee
of
the
Mat4:16
The
people
which
sat
in
darkness
saw
great
and
to
them
which
sat
in
the
region
and
shadow
of
death
light
is
sprung

p.
Mat4:17
From
that
time
Jesus
began
to
and
to
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
at
Mat4:18
And
walking
by
the
sea
of
saw
two
Simon
called
and
Andrew
his
casting
a
net
into
the
for
they
were
Mat4:19
And
he
saith
unto
Follow
and
I
will
make
you
fishers
of
Mat4:20
And
they
straightway
left
their
and
followed
Mat4:21
And
going
on
from
he
saw
other
two
James
the
son
of
and
John

in
a
ship
with
Zebedee
their
mending
their
and
he
called
Mat4:22
And
they
immediately
left
the
ship
and
their
and
followed
Mat4:23
And
Jesus
went
about
all
teaching
in
their
and
preaching
the
gospel
of
the
and
healing
all
ma

of
sickness
and
all
manner
of
disease
among
the
Mat4:24
And
his
fame
went
throughout
all
and
they
brought
unto
him
all
sick
people
that
were
taken
with
divers
diseases
and
and
those
which
were
possessed
with
and
those
which
were
lunatick,
and
those
that

healed

Mat4:25
And
there
followed
him
great
multitudes
of
people
from
and
from
and
from
and
from
an

from
beyond
Mat5:1
And
seeing
the
he
went
up
into
a
and
when
he
was
his
disciples
came
unto
Mat5:2
And
he
opened
his
and
taught
Mat5:3
Blessed

the
poor

theirs
is
the
kingdom
of

Blessed

Blessed

Blessed

Blessed

Blessed

Blessed

Blessed
are
they
which
are
persecuted

theirs
is
the
kingdom
of
Mat5:11
Blessed
are
when
men
shall
revile
and
persecute
and
shall
say
all
manner
of
evil
against
you
for
my
Mat5:12
and
be
exceeding
for
great
is
your
reward
in
for
so
persecuted

the
prophets
which
were
before

Mat5:13
Ye
are
the
salt
of
the
but
if
the
salt
have
lost
his
wherewith
shall
it
be
it
is
thenceforth
good
fo

but
to
be
cast
and
to
be
trodden
under
foot
of
Mat5:14
Ye
are
the
light
of
the
A
city
that
is
set
on
an
hill
cannot
be
Mat5:15
Neither
do
men
light

put
it
under

on

it
giveth
light
unto
all
that

Let
your
light
so
shine
before
that
they
may
see
your
good
and
glorify
your
Father
which
is
in

Think
not
that
I
am
come
to
destroy
the
or
the
I
am
not
come
to
but
to
Mat5:18
For
verily
I
say
unto
Till
heaven
and
earth
one
jot
or
one
tittle
shall
in
no
wise
pass
from
the
till
all
b

Mat5:19
Whosoever
therefore
shall
break
one
of
these
least
and
shall
teach
men
he
shall
be
called
the
least
in
th
e
kingdom
of
but
whosoever
shall
do
and
teach
the
same
shall
be
called
great
in
the
kingdom
of
Mat5:20
For
I
say
unto
That
except
your
righteousness
shall
exceed
the
righteousness
of
the
scribes
and
Pharisees,
ye
shall
in
no
case
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
Mat5:21
Ye
have
heard
that
it
was
said
by
them
of
old
Thou
shalt
not
and
whosoever
shall
kill
shall
be
in
danger
of
the
Mat5:22
But
I
say
unto
That
whosoever
is
angry
with
his
brother
without
a
cause
shall
be
in
danger
of
the
and
whosoe
ver
shall
say

his
Raca,
shall
be
in
danger
of

Therefore
if
thou
bring
thy
gift
to
the
and
there
rememberest
that
thy
brother
hath
ought
against
Mat5:24
Leave
there
thy
gift
before
the
and
go
thy
first
be
reconciled
to
thy
and
then
come
and
offer
thy
gift
.
Mat5:25
Agree
with
thine
adversary
whiles
thou
art
in
the
way
with
lest
at
any
time
the
adversary
deliver
thee
to
the
and
the
judge
deliver
thee
to

and
thou
be
cast
into

Verily
I
say
unto
Thou
shalt
by
no
means
come
out
till
thou
hast
paid
the
uttermost
Mat5:27
Ye
have
heard
that
it
was
said
by
them
of
old
Thou
shalt
not
commit
Mat5:28
But
I
say
unto
That
whosoever
looketh
on
a
woman
to
lust
after
her
hath
committed
adultery
with
her
already
in
his
hea
rt.
Mat5:29
And
if
thy
right
eye
offend
pluck
it
and
cast
it
from
for
it
is
profitable
for
thee
that
one
of
thy
member
s
should
and
not
that
thy
whole
body
should
be
cast
into
Mat5:30
And
if
thy
right
hand
offend
cut
it
and
cast
it
from
for
it
is
profitable
for
thee
that
one
of
thy
members
should
and
not
that
thy
whole
body
should
be
cast
into
Mat5:31
It
hath
been
Whosoever
shall
put
away
his
let
him
give
her
a
writing
of
Mat5:32
But
I
say
unto
That
whosoever
shall
put
away
his
saving
for
the
cause
of
causeth
her
to
commit
adul
and
whosoever
shall
marry
her
that
is
divorced
committeth
Mat5:33
ye
have
heard
that
it
hath
been
said
by
them
of
old
Thou
shalt
not
forswear
but
shalt
perform
unto
th
e
Lord
thine
Mat5:34
But
I
say
unto
Swear
not
at
neither
by
for
it
is
God's
Mat5:35
Nor
by
the
for
it
is
his
neither
by
for
it
is
the
city
of
the
great
Mat5:36
Neither
shalt
thou
swear
by
thy
because
thou
canst
not
make
one
hair
white
or
Mat5:37
But
let
your
communication
for
whatsoever
is
more
than
these
cometh
of
Mat5:38
Ye
have
heard
that
it
hath
been
An
eye
for
an
and
a
tooth
for
a
Mat5:39
But
I
say
unto
That
ye
resist
not
but
whosoever
shall
smite
thee
on
thy
right
turn
to
him
the
other
Mat5:40
And
if
any
man
will
sue
thee
at
the
and
take
away
thy
let
him
have
thy
cloak
Mat5:41
And
whosoever
shall
compel
thee
to
go
a
go
with
him
Mat5:42
Give
to
him
that
asketh
and
from
him
that
would
borrow
of
thee
turn
not
thou
Mat5:43
Ye
have
heard
that
it
hath
been
Thou
shalt
love
thy
and
hate
thine
Mat5:44
But
I
say
unto
Love
your
bless
them
that
curse
do
good
to
them
that
hate
and
pray
for
them
which
de
spitefully
use
and
persecute
Mat5:45
That
ye
may
be
the
children
of
your
Father
which
is
in
for
he
maketh
his
sun
to
rise
on
the
evil
and
on
the
a
nd
sendeth
rain
on
the
just
and
on
the
Mat5:46
For
if
ye
love
them
which
love
what
reward
have
do
not
even
the
publicans
the
Mat5:47
And
if
ye
salute
your
brethren
what
do
ye
more
than
do
not
even
the
publicans
Mat5:48
Be
ye
therefore
even
as
your
Father
which
is
in
heaven
is
Mat6:1
Take
heed
that
ye
do
not
your
alms
before
to
be
seen
of
otherwise
ye
have
no
reward
of
your
Father
which
is
in
he
aven.
Mat6:2
Therefore
when
thou
doest
thine
do
not
sound
a
trumpet
before
as
the
hypocrites
do
in
the
synagogues
and
in
the
that
they
may
have
glory
of
Verily
I
say
unto
They
have
their
Mat6:3
But
when
thou
doest
let
not
thy
left
hand
know
what
thy
right
hand
doeth:
Mat6:4
That
thine
alms
may
be
in
and
thy
Father
which
seeth
in
secret
himself
shall
reward
thee
Mat6:5
And
when
thou
prayest,
thou
shalt
not
be
as
the
hypocrites
for
they
love
to
pray
standing
in
the
synagogues
and
in
the
corners
of
the
that
they
may
be
seen
of
Verily
I
say
unto
They
have
their
Mat6:6
But
when
thou
prayest,
enter
into
thy
and
when
thou
hast
shut
thy
pray
to
thy
Father
which
is
in
and
thy
Father
which
seeth
in
secret
shall
reward
thee
Mat6:7
But
when
ye
use
not
vain
as
the
heathen
for
they
think
that
they
shall
be
heard
for
their
much
speaki
ng.
Mat6:8
Be
not
ye
therefore
like
unto
for
your
Father
knoweth
what
things
ye
have
need
before
ye
ask
Mat6:9
After

therefore
pray
Our

Mat6:14
For
if
ye
forgive
men
their
your
heavenly
Father
will
also
forgive
Mat6:15
But
if
ye
forgive
not
men
their
neither
will
your
Father
forgive

Moreover
when

Mat6:19
Lay

up

take

And
yet
I
say
unto
That
even
Solomon
in

if
God

But

And

Therefore

Enter

for

many
there
be
which
go

Because
strait
is

Beware

men
gather

Mat7:17
Even
so
every
good
tree
bringeth

a

Mat7:18
A
good

cannot
bring
forth
evil
neither
can
a
corrupt

bring

good
Mat7:19
Every
tree
that
bringeth
not
forth
good

is
hewn

Wherefore
by
their

ye
shall

Not
every
one
that
saith
unto

he
that
doeth
the
will
of
my
Fath

which
is
in
Mat7:22
Many
will
say
to
me
in
that
have
we
not
prophesied
in
thy
and
in
thy
name
have
cast
out
and
in
thy
name
done
many
wonderful
Mat7:23
And
then
will
I
profess
unto
I
never
knew
depart
from
ye
that
work
Mat7:24
Therefore
whosoever
heareth
these
sayings
of
and
doeth
I
will
liken
him
unto
a
wise
which
built
his
house
upon
a
Mat7:25
And
the
rain
and
the
floods
and
the
winds
and
beat
upon
that
and
it
fell
for
it
was
foun
ded
upon
a
Mat7:26
And
every
one
that
heareth
these
sayings
of
and
doeth
them
shall
be
likened
unto
a
foolish
which
built
his
house
upon
the
Mat7:27
And
the
rain
and
the
floods
and
the
winds
and
beat
upon
that
and
it
and
great
was
the
f
all
of
Mat7:28
And
it
came
to
when
Jesus
had
ended
these
the
people
were
astonished
at
his
Mat7:29
For
he
taught
them
as
one
having
and
not
as
the
Mat8:1
When
he
was
come
down
from
the
great
multitudes
followed
Mat8:2
there
came
a
leper
and
worshipped
if
thou
thou
canst
make
me
Mat8:3
And
Jesus
put
forth
his
and
touched
I
be
thou
And
immediately
his
leprosy
was
Mat8:4
And
Jesus
saith
unto
See
thou
tell
no
but
go
thy
shew
thyself
to
the
and
offer
the
gift
that
Moses
co
mmanded,
for
a
testimony
unto
Mat8:5
And
when
Jesus
was
entered
into
there
came
unto
him
a
beseeching
Mat8:6
And
my
servant
lieth
at
home
sick
of
the
grievously
Mat8:7
And
Jesus
saith
unto
I
will
come
and
heal
Mat8:8
The
centurion
answered
and
I
am
not
worthy
that
thou
shouldest
come
under
my
but
speak
the
word
and
my
servant
shall
be
Mat8:9
For
I
am
a
man
under
having
soldiers
under
and
I
say
to
this
and
he
goeth;
and
to
and
he
and
to
my
Do
and
he
doeth
Mat8:10
When
Jesus
heard
he
and
said
to
them
that
Verily
I
say
unto
I
have
not
found
so
great
not
in
Mat8:11
And
I
say
unto
That
many
shall
come
from
the
east
and
and
shall
sit
down
with
and
and
in
the
kingdom
of
Mat8:12
But
the
children
of
the
kingdom
shall
be
cast
out
into
outer
there
shall
be
weeping
and
gnashing
of
Mat8:13
And
Jesus
said
unto
the
Go
thy
and
as
thou
hast
so
be
it
done
unto
And
his
servant
was
heal
ed
in
the
selfsame
Mat8:14
And
when
Jesus
was
come
into
Peter's
he
saw
his
wife's
mother
and
sick
of
a
Mat8:15
And
he
touched
her
and
the
fever
left
and
she
and
ministered
unto
Mat8:16
When
the
even
was
they
brought
unto
him
many
that
were
possessed
with
and
he
cast
out
the
spirits
with
his
wo
and
healed
all
that
were
Mat8:17
That
it
might
be
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
by
Esaias
the
Himself
took
our
infirmities,
and
bare
our
sickn
esses.
Mat8:18
Now
when
Jesus
saw
great
multitudes
about
he
gave
commandment
to
depart
unto
the
other
Mat8:19
And
a
certain
scribe
and
said
unto
I
will
follow
thee
whithersoever
thou
goest.
Mat8:20
And
Jesus
saith
unto
The
foxes
have
and
the
birds
of
the
air
have
but
the
Son
of
man
hath
not
where
to
l
ay
his
Mat8:21
And
another
of
his
disciples
said
unto
suffer
me
first
to
go
and
bury
my
Mat8:22
But
Jesus
said
unto
Follow
and
let
the
dead
bury
their
Mat8:23
And
when
he
was
entered
into
a
his
disciples
followed
Mat8:24
there
arose
a
great
tempest
in
the
insomuch
that
the
ship
was
covered
with
the
but
he
was
Mat8:25
And
his
disciples
came
to
and
awoke
save
we
Mat8:26
And
he
saith
unto
Why
are
ye
O
ye
of
little
Then
he
and
rebuked
the
winds
and
the
and
the
re
was
a
great
Mat8:27
But
the
men
What
manner
of
man
is
that
even
the
winds
and
the
sea
obey
Mat8:28
And
when
he
was
come
to
the
other
side
into
the
country
of
the
Gergesenes,
there
met
him
two
possessed
with
coming
out
of
the
exceeding
so
that
no
man
might
pass
by
that
Mat8:29
they
cried
What
have
we
to
do
with
thou
Son
of
art
thou
come
hither
to
torment
us
before
the
Mat8:30
And
there
was
a
good
way
off
from
them
an
herd
of
many
swine
Mat8:31
So
the
devils
besought
If
thou
cast
us
suffer
us
to
go
away
into
the
herd
of
Mat8:32
And
he
said
unto
And
when
they
were
come
they
went
into
the
herd
of
the
whole
herd
of
sw
ine
ran
violently
down
a
steep
place
into
the
and
perished
in
the
Mat8:33
And
they
that
kept
them
and
went
their
ways
into
the
and
told
every
and
what
was
befallen
to
the
possess
ed
of
the
Mat8:34
the
whole
city
came
out
to
meet
and
when
they
saw
they
besought
him
that
he
would
depart
out
of
th
eir
Mat9:1
And
he
entered
into
a
and
passed
and
came
into
his
own
Mat9:2
they
brought
to
him
a
man
sick
of
the
lying
on
a
and
Jesus
seeing
their
faith
said
unto
the
sick
of
the
be
of
good
thy
sins
be
forgiven
Mat9:3
certain
of
the
scribes
said
within
This
man
blasphemeth.
Mat9:4
And
Jesus
knowing
their
thoughts
Wherefore
think
ye
evil
in
your
Mat9:5
For
whether
is
to
Thy
sins
be
forgiven
or
to
and
Mat9:6
But
that
ye
may
know
that
the
Son
of
man
hath
power
on
earth
to
forgive
(then
saith
he
to
the
sick
of
the
palsy,)
Aris
e,
take
up
thy
and
go
unto
thine
Mat9:7
And
he
and
departed
to
his
Mat9:8
But
when
the
multitudes
saw
they
and
glorified
which
had
given
such
power
unto
Mat9:9
And
as
Jesus
passed
forth
from
he
saw
a
named
sitting
at
the
receipt
of
and
he
saith
unto
Follow
And
he
and
followed
Mat9:10
And
it
came
to
as
Jesus
sat
at
meat
in
the
many
publicans
and
sinners
came
and
sat
down
with
him
and
h
is
Mat9:11
And
when
the
Pharisees
saw
they
said
unto
his
Why
eateth
your
Master
with
publicans
and
Mat9:12
But
when
Jesus
heard
he
said
unto
They
that
be
whole
need
not
a
but
they
that
are
Mat9:13
But
go
ye
and
learn
what
that
meaneth,
I
will
have
and
not
for
I
am
not
come
to
call
the
but
s
inners
to
Mat9:14
Then
came
to
him
the
disciples
of
Why
do
we
and
the
Pharisees
fast
but
thy
disciples
fast
Mat9:15
And
Jesus
said
unto
Can
the
children
of
the
bridechamber
as
long
as
the
bridegroom
is
with
but
the
days
will
when
the
bridegroom
shall
be
taken
from
and
then
shall
they
Mat9:16
No
man
putteth
a
piece
of
new
cloth
unto
an
old
for
that
which
is
put
in
to
fill
it
up

Neither
do
men

into

else
the
bottles
and
the
wine
runneth
and
the
bottles
but
they
put
new
wine
into
new
and
both
are
Mat9:18
While
he
spake
these
things
unto
there
came
a
certain
and
worshipped
My
daughter
is
even
now
but
come
and
lay
thy
hand
upon
and
she
shall

And
Jesus
and
followed
and
so
did
his
Mat9:20
a
which
was
diseased
with
an
issue
of
blood
twelve
came
behind
and
touched
the
hem
of
his
g
arment:
Mat9:21
For
she
said
within
If
I
may
but
touch
his
I
shall
be
Mat9:22
But
Jesus
turned
him
and
when
he
saw
he
be
of
good
thy
faith
hath
made
thee
And
the
woman
was
made
whole
from
that
Mat9:23
And
when
Jesus
came
into
the
ruler's
and
saw
the
minstrels
and
the
people
making
a
Mat9:24
He
said
unto
Give
for
the
maid
is
not
but
sleepeth.
And
they
laughed
him
to
Mat9:25
But
when
the
people
were
put
he
went
and
took
her
by
the
and
the
maid
Mat9:26
And
the
fame
hereof
went
abroad
into
all
that
Mat9:27
And
when
Jesus
departed
two
blind
men
followed
and
Thou
son
of
have
mercy
on
Mat9:28
And
when
he
was
come
into
the
the
blind
men
came
to
and
Jesus
saith
unto
Believe
ye
that
I
am
able
to
do
They
said
unto
Mat9:29
Then
touched
he
their
According
to
your
faith
be
it
unto
Mat9:30
And
their
eyes
were
and
Jesus
straitly
charged
See
that
no
man
know
Mat9:31
But
when
they
were
spread
abroad
his
fame
in
all
that
Mat9:32
As
they
went
they
brought
to
him
a
dumb
man
possessed
with
a
Mat9:33
And
when
the
devil
was
cast
the
dumb
and
the
multitudes
It
was
never
so
seen
in
Mat9:34
But
the
Pharisees
He
casteth
out
devils
through
the
prince
of
the
Mat9:35
And
Jesus
went
about
all
the
cities
and
teaching
in
their
and
preaching
the
gospel
of
the
an
d
healing
every
sickness
and
every
disease
among
the
Mat9:36
But
when
he
saw
the
he
was
moved
with
compassion
on
because
they
and
were
scattered
as
s
heep
having
no
Mat9:37
Then
saith
he
unto
his
The
harvest
truly
is
but
the
labourers
are
Mat9:38
Pray
ye
therefore
the
Lord
of
the
that
he
will
send
forth
labourers
into
his
Mat10:1
And
when
he
had
called
unto
him
his
twelve
he
gave
them
power
against
unclean
to
cast
them
and
to
heal
all
manner
of
sickness
and
all
manner
of
Mat10:2
Now

who
also
betrayed

These

sent

commanded
Go

But

And

The
kingdom
of

is
at

Heal

Provide

Nor

And
into
whatsoever
city

ye
shall
enquire
who
in
it
is

there
abide
till
ye
go

And
when
ye
come
into
an
salute
Mat10:13
And
if
the
house
be
let
your
peace
come
upon
but
if
it
be
not
let
your
peace
return
to
Mat10:14
And
whosoever
shall
not
receive
nor
hear

ye
depart
out
of
that
house
or
shake
off
the
dust
of
your
Mat10:15
Verily
I
say
unto
It
shall
be
more
tolerable
for
the
land
of
Sodom
and
Gomorrha
in
the
day
of
than
for
that
Mat10:16
I
send
you
forth
as
sheep
in
the
midst
of

ye
therefore
wise
as
and
harmless
as
Mat10:17
But
beware
of
for
they
will
deliver
you
up
to
the
and
they
will
scourge
you
in
their
Mat10:18
And
ye
shall
be
brought
before
governors
and
kings
for
my
for
a
testimony
against
them
and
the
Mat10:19
But
when
they
deliver
you
take
no
thought
how
or
what
ye
shall
for
it
shall
be
given
you
in
that
same
hour
what
ye
shall
Mat10:20
For
it
is
not
ye
that
but
the
Spirit
of
your
Father
which
speaketh
in
Mat10:21
And
the
brother
shall
deliver
up
the
brother
to
and
the
father
the
and
the
children
shall
rise
up
against
th
eir
and
cause
them
to
be
put
to
Mat10:22
And
ye
shall
be
hated
of
all
men
for
my
name's
but
he
that
endureth
to
the
end
shall
be

But
when
they
persecute
you
in
this
flee
ye
into

I
say
unto
Ye
shall
not
have
gone
over

cities

of

The
disciple
is
not
above
his

servant
above

It
is
enough
for
the
disciple
that
he
be
as
his
and
the
servant
as
his
If
they
have
called
the
master
of
the
house
how
much
more
shall
they
call
them
of

Mat10:26
Fear
them
not
for
there
is
nothing
that

not

that
shall
not

What
I
tell
you
in
that
speak
ye
in
and
what
ye
hear
in
the
that
preach
ye
upon
the
Mat10:28
And
fear
not

which
kill

are
not
able
to
kill

rather
fear
him
which
is
able
to
destroy

Are
not
two
sparrows
sold
for
a
and
one
of
them
shall
not
fall
on
the
ground
without
your

But
the
very
hairs
of
your
head
are
all
Mat10:31
Fear
ye
not

are
of
more
value
than
many
Mat10:32
Whosoever
therefore
shall
confess
me
before
him
will
I
confess
also
before
my
Father
which
is
in
Mat10:33
But
whosoever
shall
deny
me
before
him
will
I
also
deny
before

Father
which

Think
not
that

am
come
to

peace
on
I
came
not
to

a

For
I
am
come
to
set
a
man
at
variance
against
his
and
the
daughter
against
her
and
the
daughter
in
law
ag
ainst
her
mother
in
Mat10:36
And
a
man's
foes
shall
be
they
of

He
that
loveth

more
than

not
worthy

And

shall
give

unto

these
little
ones

water

verily
I
say
unto
he
shall
in
no
wise
lose
his
Mat11:1
And
it
came
to
when
Jesus
had
made
an
end
of
commanding
his
twelve
he
departed
thence
to
teach
and
to
prea
ch
in
their
Mat11:2
Now
when
John
had
heard
in
the
prison
the
works
of
he
sent
two
of
his
Mat11:3
And
said
unto
Art
thou
he
that
should
or
do
we
look
for
Mat11:4
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
Go
and
shew
John
again
those
things
which
ye
do
hear
and
Mat11:5
The
blind
receive
their
and
the
lame
the
lepers
are
and
the
deaf
the
dead
are
raised
and
t
he
poor
have
the
gospel
preached
to
Mat11:6
And
blessed
is
whosoever
shall
not
be
offended
in
Mat11:7
And
as
they
Jesus
began
to
say
unto
the
multitudes
concerning
What
went
ye
out
into
the
wilderness
to
A
reed
shaken
with
the
Mat11:8
But
what
went
ye
out
for
to
A
man
clothed
in
soft
they
that
wear
soft
clothing
are
in
Mat11:9
But
what
went
ye
out
for
to

I
say
unto
and
more
than
a
Mat11:10
For
this
is
of
whom
it
is
I
send
my
messenger
before
thy
which
shall
prepare
thy
way
before
the

Mat11:11
Verily
I
say
unto
Among
them
that
are
born
of
women
there
hath
not
risen
a
greater
than
John
the
notwithstan
ding
he
that
is
least
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
greater
than
Mat11:12
And
from
the
days
of
John
the
Baptist
until
now
the
kingdom
of
heaven
suffereth
and
the
violent
take
it
by
force
.
Mat11:13
For
all
the
prophets
and
the
law
prophesied
until
Mat11:14
And
if
ye
will
receive
this
is
which
was
for
to
Mat11:15
He
that
hath
ears
to
let
him
Mat11:16
But
whereunto
shall
I
liken
this
It
is
like
unto
children
sitting
in
the
and
calling
unto
their
fello
ws,
Mat11:17
And
We
have
piped
unto
and
ye
have
not
we
have
mourned
unto
and
ye
have
not
Mat11:18
For
John
came
neither
eating
nor
and
they
He
hath
a
Mat11:19
The
Son
of
man
came
eating
and
and
they
Behold
a
man
and
a
a
friend
of
publicans
an
d
But
wisdom
is
justified
of
her
Mat11:20
Then
began
he
to
upbraid
the
cities
wherein
most
of
his
mighty
works
were
because
they
repented
Mat11:21
Woe
unto
Chorazin!
woe
unto
for
if
the
mighty
which
were
done
in
had
been
done
in
Tyre
and
they
would
have
repented
long
ago
in
sackcloth
and
Mat11:22
But
I
say
unto
It
shall
be
more
tolerable
for
Tyre
and
Sidon
at
the
day
of
than
for
Mat11:23
And
which
art
exalted
unto
shalt
be
brought
down
to
for
if
the
mighty
which
have
bee
n
done
in
had
been
done
in
it
would
have
remained
until
this
Mat11:24
But
I
say
unto
That
it
shall
be
more
tolerable
for
the
land
of
Sodom
in
the
day
of
than
for
Mat11:25
At
that
time
Jesus
answered
and
I
thank
O
Lord
of
heaven
and
because
thou
hast
hid
these
things
from
the
wise
and
and
hast
revealed
them
unto
Mat11:26
Even
for
so
it
seemed
good
in
thy
Mat11:27
All
things
are
delivered
unto
me
of
my
and
no
man
knoweth
the
but
the
neither
knoweth
any
man
the
Fat
save
the
and
he
to
whomsoever
the
Son
will
reveal
Mat11:28
Come
unto
all
ye
that
labour
and
are
heavy
and
I
will
give
you
Mat11:29
Take
my
yoke
upon
and
learn
of
for
I
am
meek
and
lowly
in
and
ye
shall
find
rest
unto
your
Mat11:30
For
my
yoke
is
and
my
burden
is
Mat12:1
At
that
time
Jesus
went
on
the
sabbath
day
through
the
and
his
disciples
were
an
hungred,
and
began
to
pluck
the
ears
of
and
to
Mat12:2
But
when
the
Pharisees
saw
they
said
unto
thy
disciples
do
that
which
is
not
lawful
to
do
upon
the
sabbath
Mat12:3
But
he
said
unto
Have
ye
not
read
what
David
when
he
was
an
hungred,
and
they
that
were
with
Mat12:4
How
he
entered
into
the
house
of
and
did
eat
the
which
was
not
lawful
for
him
to
neither
for
them
whic
h
were
with
but
only
for
the
Mat12:5
Or
have
ye
not
read
in
the
how
that
on
the
sabbath
days
the
priests
in
the
temple
profane
the
and
are
blamele
ss?
Mat12:6
But
I
say
unto
That
in
this
place
is
one
greater
than
the
Mat12:7
But
if
ye
had
known
what
this
meaneth,
I
will
have
and
not
ye
would
not
have
condemned
the
Mat12:8
For
the
Son
of
man
is
Lord
even
of
the
sabbath
Mat12:9
And
when
he
was
departed
he
went
into
their
Mat12:10
there
was
a
man
which
had
his
hand
And
they
asked
Is
it
lawful
to
heal
on
the
sabbath
that
they
might
accuse
Mat12:11
And
he
said
unto
What
man
shall
there
be
among
that
shall
have
one
and
if
it
fall
into
a
pit
on
the
sabb
ath
will
he
not
lay
hold
on
and
lift
it
Mat12:12
How
much
then
is
a
man
better
than
a
Wherefore
it
is
lawful
to
do
well
on
the
sabbath
Mat12:13
Then
saith
he
to
the
Stretch
forth
thine
And
he
stretched
it
and
it
was
restored
like
as
the
othe
r.
Mat12:14
Then
the
Pharisees
went
and
held
a
council
against
how
they
might
destroy
Mat12:15
But
when
Jesus
knew
he
withdrew
himself
from
and
great
multitudes
followed
and
he
healed
them
Mat12:16
And
charged
them
that
they
should
not
make
him
Mat12:17
That
it
might
be
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
by
Esaias
the
Mat12:18
Behold
my
whom
I
have
my
in
whom
my
soul
is
well
I
will
put
my
spirit
upon
and
he
shall
shew
judgment
to
the
Mat12:19
He
shall
not
nor
neither
shall
any
man
hear
his
voice
in
the
Mat12:20
A
bruised
reed
shall
he
not
and
smoking
flax
shall
he
not
till
he
send
forth
judgment
unto
Mat12:21
And
in
his
name
shall
the
Gentiles
Mat12:22
Then
was
brought
unto
him
one
possessed
with
a
and
and
he
healed
insomuch
that
the
blind
and
dumb
both
spake
and
Mat12:23
And
all
the
people
were
and
Is
not
this
the
son
of
Mat12:24
But
when
the
Pharisees
heard
they
This
fellow
doth
not
cast
out
but
by
Beelzebub
the
prince
of
the
devil
s.
Mat12:25
And
Jesus
knew
their
and
said
unto
Every
kingdom
divided
against
itself
is
brought
to
and
ever
y
city
or
house
divided
against
itself
shall
not
Mat12:26
And
if
Satan
cast
out
he
is
divided
against
how
shall
then
his
kingdom
Mat12:27
And
if
I
by
Beelzebub
cast
out
by
whom
do
your
children
cast
them
therefore
they
shall
be
your
Mat12:28
But
if
I
cast
out
devils
by
the
Spirit
of
then
the
kingdom
of
God
is
come
unto
Mat12:29
Or
else
how
can
one
enter
into
a
strong
man's
and
spoil
his
except
he
first
bind
the
strong
and
then
he
will
spoil
his
Mat12:30
He
that
is
not
with
me
is
against
and
he
that
gathereth
not
with
me
scattereth
Mat12:31
Wherefore
I
say
unto
All
manner
of
sin
and
blasphemy
shall
be
forgiven
unto
but
the
blasphemy
against
the
Holy
G
host
shall
not
be
forgiven
unto
Mat12:32
And
whosoever
speaketh
a
word
against
the
Son
of
it
shall
be
forgiven
but
whosoever
speaketh
against
the
Holy
Gh
ost,
it
shall
not
be
forgiven
neither
in
this
neither
in
the
world

Mat12:33
Either
make
the
tree
and
his
fruit
or
else
make
the
tree
and
his
fruit
for
the
tree
is
known
by
his
Mat12:34
O
generation
of
how
can

Mat12:35
A
good
man
out
of
the
good
treasure
of
the
heart
bringeth
forth
good
and
an
evil
man
out
of
the
evil
treasure
brin
geth
forth
evil
Mat12:36
But
I
say
unto
That
every
idle
word
that
men
shall
they
shall
give
account
thereof
in
the
day
of
Mat12:37
For
by
thy
words
thou
shalt
be
and
by
thy
words
thou
shalt
be
Mat12:38
Then
certain
of
the
scribes
and
of
the
Pharisees
we
would
see
a
sign
from
Mat12:39
But
he
answered
and
said
unto
An
evil
and
adulterous
generation
seeketh
after
a
and
there
shall
no
sign
be
giv
en
to
but
the
sign
of
the
prophet
Mat12:40
For
as
Jonas
was
three
days
and
three
nights
in
the
whale's
so
shall
the
Son
of
man
be
three
days
and
three
nights
in
the
heart
of
the
Mat12:41
The
men
of
Nineveh
shall
rise
in
judgment
with
this
and
shall
condemn
because
they
repented
at
the
preachi

of
a
greater
than
Jonas
is
Mat12:42
The
queen
of
the
south
shall
rise
up
in
the
judgment
with
this
and
shall
condemn
for
she
came
from
the
utt
ermost
parts
of
the
earth
to
hear
the
wisdom
of
a
greater
than
Solomon

Mat12:43
When
the
unclean
spirit
is
gone
out
of

walketh
through
dry
seeking
and
findeth

Then
he

will
return
into
my
house
from
whence
I
came
and
when
he
is
he
findeth
it
and

Mat12:45
Then
goeth
and
taketh
with
himself
seven
other
spirits
more
wicked
than
and
they
enter
in
and
dwell
an

last
state
of

worse
than

Even
so
shall
it
be
also
unto
this
wicked
Mat12:46
While
he
yet
talked
to
the
his
mother
and
his
brethren
stood
desiring
to
speak
with
Mat12:47
Then
one
said
unto
thy
mother
and
thy
brethren
stand
desiring
to
speak
with
Mat12:48
But
he
answered
and
said
unto
him
that
told
Who
is
my
and
who
are
my
Mat12:49
And
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
toward
his
and
Behold
my
mother
and
my
Mat12:50
For
whosoever
shall
do
the
will
of
my
Father
which
is
in
the
same
is
my
and
and
Mat13:1
The
same
day
went
Jesus
out
of
the
and
sat
by
the
sea
Mat13:2
And
great
multitudes
were
gathered
together
unto
so
that
he
went
into
a
and
and
the
whole
multitude
stood
o
n
the
Mat13:3
And
he
spake
many
things
unto
them
in
a
sower
went
forth
to
Mat13:4
And
when
he
sowed,
some
seeds
fell
by
the
way
and
the
fowls
came
and
devoured
them
Mat13:5
Some
fell
upon
stony
where
they
had
not
much
and
forthwith
they
sprung
because
they
had
no
deepness
of
e
arth:
Mat13:6
And
when
the
sun
was
they
were
and
because
they
had
no
they
withered
Mat13:7
And
some
fell
among
and
the
thorns
sprung
and
choked
Mat13:8
But
other
fell
into
good
and
brought
forth
some
an
some
some
Mat13:9
Who
hath
ears
to
let
him
Mat13:10
And
the
disciples
and
said
unto
Why
speakest
thou
unto
them
in
Mat13:11
He
answered
and
said
unto
Because
it
is
given
unto
you
to
know
the
mysteries
of
the
kingdom
of
but
to
them
i
t
is
not
Mat13:12
For
whosoever
to
him
shall
be
and
he
shall
have
more
but
whosoever
hath
from
him
shall
be
tak
en
away
even
that
he
Mat13:13
Therefore
speak
I
to
them
in
because
they
seeing
see
and
hearing
they
hear
neither
do
they
Mat13:14
And
in
them
is
fulfilled
the
prophecy
of
Esaias,
which
By
hearing
ye
shall
and
shall
not
and
seei
ng
ye
shall
and
shall
not
Mat13:15
For
this
people's
heart
is
waxed
and
their
ears
are
dull
of
and
their
eyes
they
have
lest
at
any
t
ime
they
should
see
with
their
eyes
and
hear
with
their
and
should
understand
with
their
and
should
be
and
I
should
heal
Mat13:16
But
blessed
are
your
for
they
and
your
for
they
Mat13:17
For
verily
I
say
unto
That
many
prophets
and
righteous
men
have
desired
to
see
those
things
which
ye
and
have
no
t
seen
and
to
hear
those
things
which
ye
and
have
not
heard
Mat13:18
Hear
ye
therefore
the
parable
of
the
Mat13:19
When
any
one
heareth
the
word
of
the
and
understandeth
it
then
cometh
the
wicked
and
catcheth
away
that
which
was
sown
in
his
This
is
he
which
received
seed
by
the
way
Mat13:20
But
he
that
received
the
seed
into
stony
the
same
is
he
that
heareth
the
and
anon
with
joy
receiveth
Mat13:21
Yet
hath
he
not
root
in
but
dureth
for
a
for
when
tribulation
or
persecution
ariseth
because
of
the
by
and
by
he
is
Mat13:22
He
also
that
received
seed
among
the
thorns
is
he
that
heareth
the
and
the
care
of
this
and
the
deceitfulness
of
choke
the
and
he
becometh
Mat13:23
But
he
that
received
seed
into
the
good
ground
is
he
that
heareth
the
and
understandeth
which
also
beareth
fruit
,
and
bringeth
some
an
some
some
Mat13:24
Another
parable
put
he
forth
unto
The
kingdom
of
heaven
is
likened
unto
a
man
which
sowed
good
seed
in
his
f
ield:
Mat13:25
But
while
men
his
enemy
came
and
sowed
tares
among
the
and
went
his
Mat13:26
But
when
the
blade
was
sprung
and
brought
forth
then
appeared
the
tares
Mat13:27
So
the
servants
of
the
householder
came
and
said
unto
didst
not
thou
sow
good
seed
in
thy
from
whence
the
n
hath
it
tares?
Mat13:28
He
said
unto
An
enemy
hath
done
The
servants
said
unto
Wilt
thou
then
that
we
go
and
gather
them
Mat13:29
But
he
lest
while
ye
gather
up
the
tares,
ye
root
up
also
the
wheat
with
Mat13:30
Let
both
grow
together
until
the
and
in
the
time
of
harvest
I
will
say
to
the
reapers,
Gather
ye
together
first
t
he
tares,
and
bind
them
in
bundles
to
burn
but
gather
the
wheat
into
my
Mat13:31
Another
parable
put
he
forth
unto
The
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
to
a
grain
of
mustard
which
a
man
took
,
and
sowed
in
his
Mat13:32
Which
indeed
is
the
least
of
all
but
when
it
is
it
is
the
greatest
among
and
becometh
a
so
that
the
birds
of
the
air
come
and
lodge
in
the
branches
Mat13:33
Another
parable
spake
he
unto
The
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
unto
which
a
woman
and
hid
in
three
measur
es
of
till
the
whole
was
Mat13:34
All
these
things
spake
Jesus
unto
the
multitude
in
and
without
a
parable
spake
he
not
unto
Mat13:35
That
it
might
be
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
by
the
I
will
open
my
mouth
in
I
will
utter
things
which
have
been
kept
secret
from
the
foundation
of
the
Mat13:36
Then
Jesus
sent
the
multitude
and
went
into
the
and
his
disciples
came
unto
Declare
unto
us
the
parable
of
the
tares
of
the
Mat13:37
He
answered
and
said
unto
He
that
soweth
the
good
seed
is
the
Son
of
Mat13:38
The
field
is
the
the
good
seed
are
the
children
of
the
but
the
tares
are
the
children
of
the
wicked
Mat13:39
The
enemy
that
sowed
them
is
the
the
harvest
is
the
end
of
the
and
the
reapers
are
the
Mat13:40
As
therefore
the
tares
are
gathered
and
burned
in
the
so
shall
it
be
in
the
end
of
this
Mat13:41
The
Son
of
man
shall
send
forth
his
and
they
shall
gather
out
of
his
kingdom
all
things
that
and
them
whic
h
do
Mat13:42
And
shall
cast
them
into
a
furnace
of
there
shall
be
wailing
and
gnashing
of
Mat13:43
Then
shall
the
righteous
shine
forth
as
the
sun
in
the
kingdom
of
their
Who
hath
ears
to
let
him
Mat13:44
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
unto
treasure
hid
in
a
the
which
when
a
man
hath
he
hideth,
and
for
joy
thereof
goeth
and
selleth
all
that
he
and
buyeth
that
Mat13:45
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
unto
a
merchant
seeking
goodly
Mat13:46
when
he
had
found
one
pearl
of
great
went
and
sold
all
that
he
and
bought
Mat13:47
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
unto
a
that
was
cast
into
the
and
gathered
of
every
Mat13:48
when
it
was
they
drew
to
and
sat
and
gathered
the
good
into
but
cast
the
bad
Mat13:49
So
shall
it
be
at
the
end
of
the
the
angels
shall
come
and
sever
the
wicked
from
among
the
Mat13:50
And
shall
cast
them
into
the
furnace
of
there
shall
be
wailing
and
gnashing
of
Mat13:51
Jesus
saith
unto
Have
ye
understood
all
these
They
say
unto
Mat13:52
Then
said
he
unto
Therefore
every
scribe
which
is
instructed
unto
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
unto
a
man
that
is
a
n
which
bringeth
forth
out
of
his
treasure
things
new
and
Mat13:53
And
it
came
to
that
when
Jesus
had
finished
these
he
departed
Mat13:54
And
when
he
was
come
into
his
own
he
taught
them
in
their
insomuch
that
they
were
and
said
,
Whence
hath
this
man
this
and
these
mighty
Mat13:55
Is
not
this
the
carpenter's
is
not
his
mother
called
and
his
and
Joses,
and
and
Mat13:56
And
his
are
they
not
all
with
Whence
then
hath
this
man
all
these
Mat13:57
And
they
were
offended
in
But
Jesus
said
unto
A
prophet
is
not
without
save
in
his
own
and
in
his
own
Mat13:58
And
he
did
not
many
mighty
works
there
because
of
their
Mat14:1
At
that
time
Herod
the
tetrarch
heard
of
the
fame
of
Mat14:2
And
said
unto
his
This
is
John
the
he
is
risen
from
the
and
therefore
mighty
works
do
shew
forth
t
hemselves
in
Mat14:3
For
Herod
had
laid
hold
on
and
bound
and
put
him
in
prison
for
his
brother
Philip's
Mat14:4
For
John
said
unto
It
is
not
lawful
for
thee
to
have
Mat14:5
And
when
he
would
have
put
him
to
he
feared
the
because
they
counted
him
as
a
Mat14:6
But
when
Herod's
birthday
was
the
daughter
of
Herodias
danced
before
and
pleased
Mat14:7
Whereupon
he
promised
with
an
oath
to
give
her
whatsoever
she
would
Mat14:8
And
being
before
instructed
of
her
Give
me
here
John
Baptist's
head
in
a
Mat14:9
And
the
king
was
nevertheless
for
the
oath's
and
them
which
sat
with
him
at
he
commanded
it
to
be
given
Mat14:10
And
he
and
beheaded
John
in
the
Mat14:11
And
his
head
was
brought
in
a
and
given
to
the
and
she
brought
it
to
her
Mat14:12
And
his
disciples
and
took
up
the
and
buried
and
went
and
told
Mat14:13
When
Jesus
heard
of
he
departed
thence
by
ship
into
a
desert
place
and
when
the
people
had
heard
they
followed
him
on
foot
out
of
the
Mat14:14
And
Jesus
went
and
saw
a
great
and
was
moved
with
compassion
toward
and
he
healed
their
Mat14:15
And
when
it
was
his
disciples
came
to
This
is
a
desert
and
the
time
is
now
send
the
mul
titude
that
they
may
go
into
the
and
buy
themselves
Mat14:16
But
Jesus
said
unto
They
need
not
give
ye
them
to
Mat14:17
And
they
say
unto
We
have
here
but
five
and
two
Mat14:18
He
Bring
them
hither
to
Mat14:19
And
he
commanded
the
multitude
to
sit
down
on
the
and
took
the
five
and
the
two
and
looking
up
to
h
eaven,
he
and
and
gave
the
loaves
to
his
and
the
disciples
to
the
Mat14:20
And
they
did
all
and
were
and
they
took
up
of
the
fragments
that
remained
twelve
baskets
Mat14:21
And
they
that
had
eaten
were
about
five
thousand
beside
women
and
Mat14:22
And
straightway
Jesus
constrained
his
disciples
to
get
into
a
and
to
go
before
him
unto
the
other
while
he
sen
t
the
multitudes
Mat14:23
And
when
he
had
sent
the
multitudes
he
went
up
into
a
mountain
apart
to
and
when
the
evening
was
he
was
there
Mat14:24
But
the
ship
was
now
in
the
midst
of
the
tossed
with
for
the
wind
was
Mat14:25
And
in
the
fourth
watch
of
the
night
Jesus
went
unto
walking
on
the
Mat14:26
And
when
the
disciples
saw
him
walking
on
the
they
were
It
is
a
and
they
cried
out
for
fear
.
Mat14:27
But
straightway
Jesus
spake
unto
Be
of
good
it
is
be
not
Mat14:28
And
Peter
answered
him
and
if
it
be
bid
me
come
unto
thee
on
the
Mat14:29
And
he
And
when
Peter
was
come
down
out
of
the
he
walked
on
the
to
go
to
Mat14:30
But
when
he
saw
the
wind
he
was
and
beginning
to
he
save
Mat14:31
And
immediately
Jesus
stretched
forth
his
and
caught
and
said
unto
O
thou
of
little
wherefore
didst
thou
Mat14:32
And
when
they
were
come
into
the
the
wind
Mat14:33
Then
they
that
were
in
the
ship
came
and
worshipped
Of
a
truth
thou
art
the
Son
of
Mat14:34
And
when
they
were
gone
they
came
into
the
land
of
Gennesaret.
Mat14:35
And
when
the
men
of
that
place
had
knowledge
of
they
sent
out
into
all
that
country
round
and
brought
unto
him
all
that
were
Mat14:36
And
besought
him
that
they
might
only
touch
the
hem
of
his
and
as
many
as
touched
were
made
perfectly
Mat15:1
Then
came
to
Jesus
scribes
and
Pharisees,
which
were
of
Mat15:2
Why
do
thy
disciples
transgress
the
tradition
of
the
for
they
wash
not
their
hands
when
they
eat
Mat15:3
But
he
answered
and
said
unto
Why
do
ye
also
transgress
the
commandment
of
God
by
your
Mat15:4
For
God
Honour
thy
father
and
He
that
curseth
father
or
let
him
die
the
Mat15:5
But
ye
Whosoever
shall
say
to
his
father
or
his
It
is
a
by
whatsoever
thou
mightest
be
profited
by
Mat15:6
And
honour
not
his
father
or
his
he
shall
be
Thus
have
ye
made
the
commandment
of
God
of
none
effect
by
your
Mat15:7
Ye
well
did
Esaias
prophesy
of
Mat15:8
This
people
draweth
nigh
unto
me
with
their
and
honoureth
me
with
their
but
their
heart
is
far
from
Mat15:9
But
in
vain
they
do
worship
teaching
for
doctrines
the
commandments
of
Mat15:10
And
he
called
the
and
said
unto
and
Mat15:11
Not
that
which
goeth
into
the
mouth
defileth
a
but
that
which
cometh
out
of
the
this
defileth
a
Mat15:12
Then
came
his
and
said
unto
Knowest
thou
that
the
Pharisees
were
after
they
heard
this
Mat15:13
But
he
answered
and
Every
which
my
heavenly
Father
hath
not
shall
be
rooted
Mat15:14
Let
them
they
be
blind
leaders
of
the
And
if
the
blind
lead
the
both
shall
fall
into
the
Mat15:15
Then
answered
Peter
and
said
unto
Declare
unto
us
this
Mat15:16
And
Jesus
Are
ye
also
yet
without
Mat15:17
Do
not
ye
yet
that
whatsoever
entereth
in
at
the
mouth
goeth
into
the
and
is
cast
out
into
the
Mat15:18
But
those
things
which
proceed
out
of
the
mouth
come
forth
from
the
and
they
defile
the
Mat15:19
For
out
of
the
heart
proceed
evil
adulteries,
false
Mat15:20
These
are
the
things
which
defile
a
but
to
eat
with
unwashen
hands
defileth
not
a
Mat15:21
Then
Jesus
went
and
departed
into
the
coasts
of
Tyre
and
Mat15:22
a
woman
of
Canaan
came
out
of
the
same
and
cried
unto
Have
mercy
on
O
thou
son
of
my
daughter
is
grievously
vexed
with
a
Mat15:23
But
he
answered
her
not
a
And
his
disciples
came
and
besought
Send
her
for
she
crieth
after
Mat15:24
But
he
answered
and
I
am
not
sent
but
unto
the
lost
sheep
of
the
house
of
Mat15:25
Then
came
she
and
worshipped
help
Mat15:26
But
he
answered
and
It
is
not
meet
to
take
the
children's
and
to
cast
it
to
Mat15:27
And
she
yet
the
dogs
eat
of
the
crumbs
which
fall
from
their
Mat15:28
Then
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
O
great
is
thy
be
it
unto
thee
even
as
thou
And
her
daughter
wa
s
made
whole
from
that
very
Mat15:29
And
Jesus
departed
from
and
came
nigh
unto
the
sea
of
and
went
up
into
a
and
sat
down
Mat15:30
And
great
multitudes
came
unto
having
with
them
those
that
were
and
many
and
cast
them
down
at
and
he
healed
Mat15:31
Insomuch
that
the
multitude
when
they
saw
the
dumb
to
the
maimed
to
be
the
lame
to
and
the
b
lind
to
and
they
glorified
the
God
of
Mat15:32
Then
Jesus
called
his
disciples
unto
and
I
have
compassion
on
the
because
they
continue
with
me
now
three
and
have
nothing
to
and
I
will
not
send
them
away
lest
they
faint
in
the
Mat15:33
And
his
disciples
say
unto
Whence
should
we
have
so
much
bread
in
the
as
to
fill
so
great
a
Mat15:34
And
Jesus
saith
unto
How
many
loaves
have
And
they
and
a
few
little
Mat15:35
And
he
commanded
the
multitude
to
sit
down
on
the
Mat15:36
And
he
took
the
seven
loaves
and
the
and
gave
and
brake
and
gave
to
his
and
the
disciples
to
the
Mat15:37
And
they
did
all
and
were
and
they
took
up
of
the
broken
meat
that
was
left
seven
baskets
Mat15:38
And
they
that
did
eat
were
four
thousand
beside
women
and
Mat15:39
And
he
sent
away
the
and
took
and
came
into
the
coasts
of
Magdala.
Mat16:1
The
Pharisees
also
with
the
Sadducees
and
tempting
desired
him
that
he
would
shew
them
a
sign
from
Mat16:2
He
answered
and
said
unto
When
it
is
ye
It
will
be
fair
for
the
sky
is
Mat16:3
And
in
the
It
will
be
foul
weather
to
for
the
sky
is
red
and
lowring.
O
ye
ye
can
discern
the
fac
e
of
the
but
can
ye
not
discern
the
signs
of
the
Mat16:4
A
wicked
and
adulterous
generation
seeketh
after
a
and
there
shall
no
sign
be
given
unto
but
the
sign
of
the
prop
het
And
he
left
and
Mat16:5
And
when
his
disciples
were
come
to
the
other
they
had
forgotten
to
take
Mat16:6
Then
Jesus
said
unto
Take
heed
and
beware
of
the
leaven
of
the
Pharisees
and
of
the
Sadducees.
Mat16:7
And
they
reasoned
among
It
is
because
we
have
taken
no
Mat16:8
Which
when
Jesus
he
said
unto
O
ye
of
little
why
reason
ye
among
because
ye
have
brough
t
no
Mat16:9
Do
ye
not
yet
neither
remember
the
five
loaves
of
the
five
and
how
many
baskets
ye
took
Mat16:10
Neither
the
seven
loaves
of
the
four
and
how
many
baskets
ye
took
Mat16:11
How
is
it
that
ye
do
not
understand
that
I
spake
it
not
to
you
concerning
that
ye
should
beware
of
the
leaven
of
th
e
Pharisees
and
of
the
Sadducees?
Mat16:12
Then
understood
they
how
that
he
bade
them
not
beware
of
the
leaven
of
but
of
the
doctrine
of
the
Pharisees
and
of
the
Sadducees.
Mat16:13
When
Jesus
came
into
the
coasts
of
Caesarea
he
asked
his
Whom
do
men
say
that
I
the
Son
of
ma
n
Mat16:14
And
they
Some
say
that
thou
art
John
the
and
Jeremias,
or
one
of
the
Mat16:15
He
saith
unto
But
whom
say
ye
that
I
Mat16:16
And
Simon
Peter
answered
and
Thou
art
the
the
Son
of
the
living
Mat16:17
And
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
Blessed
art
Simon
Barjona:
for
flesh
and
blood
hath
not
revealed
it
unto
but
my
Father
which
is
in
Mat16:18
And
I
say
also
unto
That
thou
art
and
upon
this
rock
I
will
build
my
and
the
gates
of
hell
shall
not
prevail
against
Mat16:19
And
I
will
give
unto
thee
the
keys
of
the
kingdom
of
and
whatsoever
thou
shalt
bind
on
earth
shall
be
bound
in
hea
ven:
and
whatsoever
thou
shalt
loose
on
earth
shall
be
loosed
in
Mat16:20
Then
charged
he
his
disciples
that
they
should
tell
no
man
that
he
was
Jesus
the
Mat16:21
From
that
time
forth
began
Jesus
to
shew
unto
his
how
that
he
must
go
unto
and
suffer
many
things
of
the
elders
and
chief
priests
and
and
be
and
be
raised
again
the
third
Mat16:22
Then
Peter
took
and
began
to
rebuke
Be
it
far
from
this
shall
not
be
unto
Mat16:23
But
he
and
said
unto
Get
thee
behind
thou
art
an
offence
unto
for
thou
savourest
not
the
thi
ngs
that
be
of
but
those
that
be
of
Mat16:24
Then
said
Jesus
unto
his
If
any
man
will
come
after
let
him
deny
and
take
up
his
and
follow
Mat16:25
For
whosoever
will
save
his
life
shall
lose
and
whosoever
will
lose
his
life
for
my
sake
shall
find
Mat16:26
For
what
is
a
man
if
he
shall
gain
the
whole
and
lose
his
own
or
what
shall
a
man
give
in
exchange
for
his
Mat16:27
For
the
Son
of
man
shall
come
in
the
glory
of
his
Father
with
his
and
then
he
shall
reward
every
man
according
to
his
Mat16:28
Verily
I
say
unto
There
be
some
standing
which
shall
not
taste
of
till
they
see
the
Son
of
man
coming
in
his
Mat17:1
And
after
six
days
Jesus
taketh
and
John
his
and
bringeth
them
up
into
an
high
mountain
Mat17:2
And
was
transfigured
before
and
his
face
did
shine
as
the
and
his
raiment
was
white
as
the
Mat17:3
there
appeared
unto
them
Moses
and
Elias
talking
with
Mat17:4
Then
answered
and
said
unto
it
is
good
for
us
to
be
if
thou
let
us
make
here
three
tabernac
one
for
and
one
for
and
one
for
Mat17:5
While
he
yet
a
bright
cloud
overshadowed
and
behold
a
voice
out
of
the
which
This
is
my
b
eloved
in
whom
I
am
well
hear
ye
Mat17:6
And
when
the
disciples
heard
they
fell
on
their
and
were
sore
Mat17:7
And
Jesus
came
and
touched
and
and
be
not
Mat17:8
And
when
they
had
lifted
up
their
they
saw
no
save
Jesus
Mat17:9
And
as
they
came
down
from
the
Jesus
charged
Tell
the
vision
to
no
until
the
Son
of
man
be
ris
en
again
from
the
Mat17:10
And
his
disciples
asked
Why
then
say
the
scribes
that
Elias
must
first
Mat17:11
And
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
Elias
truly
shall
first
and
restore
all
Mat17:12
But
I
say
unto
That
Elias
is
come
and
they
knew
him
but
have
done
unto
him
whatsoever
they
Like
wise
shall
also
the
Son
of
man
suffer
of
Mat17:13
Then
the
disciples
understood
that
he
spake
unto
them
of
John
the
Mat17:14
And
when
they
were
come
to
the
there
came
to
him
a
certain
kneeling
down
to
and
Mat17:15
have
mercy
on
my
for
he
is
lunatick,
and
sore
for
ofttimes
he
falleth
into
the
and
oft
into
the
wa
Mat17:16
And
I
brought
him
to
thy
and
they
could
not
cure
Mat17:17
Then
Jesus
answered
and
O
faithless
and
perverse
how
long
shall
I
be
with
how
long
shall
I
suffer
y
ou?
bring
him
hither
to
Mat17:18
And
Jesus
rebuked
the
and
he
departed
out
of
and
the
child
was
cured
from
that
very
Mat17:19
Then
came
the
disciples
to
Jesus
and
Why
could
not
we
cast
him
Mat17:20
And
Jesus
said
unto
Because
of
your
for
verily
I
say
unto
If
ye
have
faith
as
a
grain
of
mustard
seed
,
ye
shall
say
unto
this
Remove
hence
to
yonder
and
it
shall
and
nothing
shall
be
impossible
unto
Mat17:21
Howbeit
this
kind
goeth
not
out
but
by
prayer
and
Mat17:22
And
while
they
abode
in
Jesus
said
unto
The
Son
of
man
shall
be
betrayed
into
the
hands
of
Mat17:23
And
they
shall
kill
and
the
third
day
he
shall
be
raised
And
they
were
exceeding
Mat17:24
And
when
they
were
come
to
they
that
received
tribute
money
came
to
and
Doth
not
your
master
pay
t
ribute?
Mat17:25
He
And
when
he
was
come
into
the
Jesus
prevented
What
thinkest
of
whom
do
the
kings
of
the
earth
take
custom
or
of
their
own
or
of
Mat17:26
Peter
saith
unto
Of
Jesus
saith
unto
Then
are
the
children
Mat17:27
lest
we
should
offend
go
thou
to
the
and
cast
an
and
take
up
the
fish
that
first
cometh
and
when
thou
hast
opened
his
thou
shalt
find
a
piece
of
that
and
give
unto
them
for
me
and
Mat18:1
At
the
same
time
came
the
disciples
unto
Who
is
the
greatest
in
the
kingdom
of
Mat18:2
And
Jesus
called
a
little
child
unto
and
set
him
in
the
midst
of
Mat18:3
And
Verily
I
say
unto
Except
ye
be
and
become
as
little
ye
shall
not
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
Mat18:4
Whosoever
therefore
shall
humble
himself
as
this
little
the
same
is
greatest
in
the
kingdom
of
Mat18:5
And
whoso
shall
receive
one
such
little
child
in
my
name
receiveth
Mat18:6
But
whoso
shall
offend
one
of
these
little
ones
which
believe
in
it
were
better
for
him
that
a
millstone
were
hanged
ab
out
his
and
that
he
were
drowned
in
the
depth
of
the
Mat18:7
Woe
unto
the
world
because
of
for
it
must
needs
be
that
offences
but
woe
to
that
man
by
whom
the
offence
co
meth!
Mat18:8
Wherefore
if
thy
hand
or
thy
foot
offend
cut
them
and
cast
them
from
it
is
better
for
thee
to
enter
into
l
ife
halt
or
rather
than
having
two
hands
or
two
feet
to
be
cast
into
everlasting
Mat18:9
And
if
thine
eye
offend
pluck
it
and
cast
it
from
it
is
better
for
thee
to
enter
into
life
with
one
r
ather
than
having
two
eyes
to
be
cast
into
hell
Mat18:10
Take
heed
that
ye
despise
not
one
of
these
little
for
I
say
unto
That
in
heaven
their
angels
do
always
behold
t
he
face
of
my
Father
which
is
in
Mat18:11
For
the
Son
of
man
is
come
to
save
that
which
was
Mat18:12
How
think
if
a
man
have
an
hundred
and
one
of
them
be
gone
doth
he
not
leave
the
ninety
and
and
g
oeth
into
the
and
seeketh
that
which
is
gone
Mat18:13
And
if
so
be
that
he
find
verily
I
say
unto
he
rejoiceth
more
of
that
than
of
the
ninety
and
nine
which
we
nt
not
Mat18:14
Even
so
it
is
not
the
will
of
your
Father
which
is
in
that
one
of
these
little
ones
should
Mat18:15
Moreover
if
thy
brother
shall
trespass
against
go
and
tell
him
his
fault
between
thee
and
him
if
he
shall
hea
r
thou
hast
gained
thy
Mat18:16
But
if
he
will
not
hear
then
take
with
thee
one
or
two
that
in
the
mouth
of
two
or
three
witnesses
every
word
may
be
Mat18:17
And
if
he
shall
neglect
to
hear
tell
it
unto
the
but
if
he
neglect
to
hear
the
let
him
be
unto
thee
as
an
heathen
man
and
a
Mat18:18
Verily
I
say
unto
Whatsoever
ye
shall
bind
on
earth
shall
be
bound
in
and
whatsoever
ye
shall
loose
on
earth
shall
be
loosed
in
Mat18:19
Again
I
say
unto
That
if
two
of
you
shall
agree
on
earth
as
touching
any
thing
that
they
shall
it
shall
be
done
for
them
of
my
Father
which
is
in
Mat18:20
For
where
two
or
three
are
gathered
together
in
my
there
am
I
in
the
midst
of
Mat18:21
Then
came
Peter
to
and
how
oft
shall
my
brother
sin
against
and
I
forgive
till
seven
Mat18:22
Jesus
saith
unto
I
say
not
unto
Until
seven
Until
seventy
times
Mat18:23
Therefore
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven
likened
unto
a
certain
which
would
take
account
of
his
Mat18:24
And
when
he
had
begun
to
one
was
brought
unto
which
owed
him
ten
thousand
Mat18:25
But
forasmuch
as
he
had
not
to
his
lord
commanded
him
to
be
and
his
and
and
all
that
he
an
d
payment
to
be
Mat18:26
The
servant
therefore
fell
and
worshipped
have
patience
with
and
I
will
pay
thee
Mat18:27
Then
the
lord
of
that
servant
was
moved
with
and
loosed
and
forgave
him
the
Mat18:28
But
the
same
servant
went
and
found
one
of
his
fellowservants,
which
owed
him
an
hundred
and
he
laid
hands
on
and
took
him
by
the
Pay
me
that
thou
owest.
Mat18:29
And
his
fellowservant
fell
down
at
his
and
besought
Have
patience
with
and
I
will
pay
thee
Mat18:30
And
he
would
but
went
and
cast
him
into
till
he
should
pay
the
Mat18:31
So
when
his
fellowservants
saw
what
was
they
were
very
and
came
and
told
unto
their
lord
all
that
was
Mat18:32
Then
his
after
that
he
had
called
said
unto
O
thou
wicked
I
forgave
thee
all
that
because
t
hou
desiredst
Mat18:33
Shouldest
not
thou
also
have
had
compassion
on
thy
fellowservant,
even
as
I
had
pity
on
Mat18:34
And
his
lord
was
and
delivered
him
to
the
tormentors,
till
he
should
pay
all
that
was
due
unto
Mat18:35
So
likewise
shall
my
heavenly
Father
do
also
unto
if
ye
from
your
hearts
forgive
not
every
one
his
brother
their
tres
Mat19:1
And
it
came
to
that
when
Jesus
had
finished
these
he
departed
from
and
came
into
the
coasts
of
Juda
ea
beyond
Mat19:2
And
great
multitudes
followed
and
he
healed
them
Mat19:3
The
Pharisees
also
came
unto
tempting
and
saying
unto
Is
it
lawful
for
a
man
to
put
away
his
wife
for
every
Mat19:4
And
he
answered
and
said
unto
Have
ye
not
that
he
which
made
them
at
the
beginning
made
them
male
and
Mat19:5
And
For
this
cause
shall
a
man
leave
father
and
and
shall
cleave
to
his
and
they
twain
shall
be
one
fle
sh?
Mat19:6
Wherefore
they
are
no
more
but
one
What
therefore
God
hath
joined
let
not
man
put
Mat19:7
They
say
unto
Why
did
Moses
then
command
to
give
a
writing
of
and
to
put
her
Mat19:8
He
saith
unto
Moses
because
of
the
hardness
of
your
hearts
suffered
you
to
put
away
your
but
from
the
beginnin
g
it
was
not
Mat19:9
And
I
say
unto
Whosoever
shall
put
away
his
except
it
be
for
and
shall
marry
committeth
ad
ultery:
and
whoso
marrieth
her
which
is
put
away
doth
commit
Mat19:10
His
disciples
say
unto
If
the
case
of
the
man
be
so
with
his
it
is
not
good
to
Mat19:11
But
he
said
unto
All
men
cannot
receive
this
save
they
to
whom
it
is
Mat19:12
For
there
are
some
which
were
so
born
from
their
mother's
and
there
are
some
which
were
made
eunuc
hs
of
and
there
be
which
have
made
themselves
eunuchs
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven's
He
that
is
able
to
receive
it
,
let
him
receive
Mat19:13
Then
were
there
brought
unto
him
little
that
he
should
put
his
hands
on
and
and
the
disciples
rebuke
d
Mat19:14
But
Jesus
Suffer
little
and
forbid
them
to
come
unto
for
of
such
is
the
kingdom
of
Mat19:15
And
he
laid
his
hands
on
and
departed
Mat19:16
one
came
and
said
unto
Good
what
good
thing
shall
I
that
I
may
have
eternal
Mat19:17
And
he
said
unto
Why
callest
thou
me
there
is
none
good
but
that
but
if
thou
wilt
enter
into
life
,
keep
the
Mat19:18
He
saith
unto
Jesus
Thou
shalt
do
no
Thou
shalt
not
commit
Thou
shalt
not
Thou
shalt
not
bear
false
Mat19:19
Honour
thy
father
and
thy
Thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbour
as
Mat19:20
The
young
man
saith
unto
All
these
things
have
I
kept
from
my
youth
what
lack
I
Mat19:21
Jesus
said
unto
If
thou
wilt
be
go
and
sell
that
thou
and
give
to
the
and
thou
shalt
have
treasu
re
in
and
come
and
follow
Mat19:22
But
when
the
young
man
heard
that
he
went
away
for
he
had
great
Mat19:23
Then
said
Jesus
unto
his
Verily
I
say
unto
That
a
rich
man
shall
hardly
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
Mat19:24
And
again
I
say
unto
It
is
easier
for
a
camel
to
go
through
the
eye
of
a
than
for
a
rich
man
to
enter
into
th
e
kingdom
of
Mat19:25
When
his
disciples
heard
they
were
exceedingly
Who
then
can
be
Mat19:26
But
Jesus
beheld
and
said
unto
With
men
this
is
but
with
God
all
things
are
Mat19:27
Then
answered
Peter
and
said
unto
we
have
forsaken
and
followed
what
shall
we
have
Mat19:28
And
Jesus
said
unto
Verily
I
say
unto
That
ye
which
have
followed
in
the
regeneration
when
the
Son
of
man
s
hall
sit
in
the
throne
of
his
ye
also
shall
sit
upon
twelve
judging
the
twelve
tribes
of
Mat19:29
And
every
one
that
hath
forsaken
or
or
or
or
or
or
or
fo
r
my
name's
shall
receive
an
and
shall
inherit
everlasting
Mat19:30
But
many
that
are
first
shall
be
and
the
last
shall
be
Mat20:1
For
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
unto
a
man
that
is
an
which
went
out
early
in
the
morning
to
hire
labourers
into
his
Mat20:2
And
when
he
had
agreed
with
the
labourers
for
a
penny
a
he
sent
them
into
his
Mat20:3
And
he
went
out
about
the
third
and
saw
others
standing
idle
in
the
Mat20:4
And
said
unto
Go
ye
also
into
the
and
whatsoever
is
right
I
will
give
And
they
went
their
Mat20:5
Again
he
went
out
about
the
sixth
and
ninth
and
did
Mat20:6
And
about
the
eleventh
hour
he
went
and
found
others
standing
and
saith
unto
Why
stand
ye
here
all
the
day
Mat20:7
They
say
unto
Because
no
man
hath
hired
He
saith
unto
Go
ye
also
into
the
and
whatsoever
is
that
shall
ye
Mat20:8
So
when
even
was
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
saith
unto
his
Call
the
and
give
them
their
begin
ning
from
the
last
unto
the
Mat20:9
And
when
they
came
that
were
hired
about
the
eleventh
they
received
every
man
a
Mat20:10
But
when
the
first
they
supposed
that
they
should
have
received
and
they
likewise
received
every
man
a
Mat20:11
And
when
they
had
received
they
murmured
against
the
goodman
of
the
Mat20:12
These
last
have
wrought
but
one
and
thou
hast
made
them
equal
unto
which
have
borne
the
burden
and
heat
of
the
Mat20:13
But
he
answered
one
of
and
I
do
thee
no
didst
not
thou
agree
with
me
for
a
Mat20:14
Take
that
thine
and
go
thy
I
will
give
unto
this
even
as
unto
Mat20:15
Is
it
not
lawful
for
me
to
do
what
I
will
with
mine
Is
thine
eye
because
I
am
Mat20:16
So
the
last
shall
be
and
the
first
for
many
be
but
few
Mat20:17
And
Jesus
going
up
to
Jerusalem
took
the
twelve
disciples
apart
in
the
and
said
unto
Mat20:18
we
go
up
to
and
the
Son
of
man
shall
be
betrayed
unto
the
chief
priests
and
unto
the
and
they
shall
condemn
him
to
Mat20:19
And
shall
deliver
him
to
the
Gentiles
to
and
to
and
to
crucify
and
the
third
day
he
shall
rise
Mat20:20
Then
came
to
him
the
mother
of
Zebedee's
children
with
her
worshipping
and
desiring
a
certain
thing
of
Mat20:21
And
he
said
unto
What
wilt
She
saith
unto
Grant
that
these
my
two
sons
may
the
one
on
thy
right
and
the
other
on
the
in
thy
Mat20:22
But
Jesus
answered
and
Ye
know
not
what
ye
Are
ye
able
to
drink
of
the
cup
that
I
shall
drink
and
to
be
bap
tized
with
the
baptism
that
I
am
baptized
They
say
unto
We
are
Mat20:23
And
he
saith
unto
Ye
shall
drink
indeed
of
my
and
be
baptized
with
the
baptism
that
I
am
baptized
but
to
sit
on
my
right
and
on
my
is
not
mine
to
but
it
shall
be
given
to
them
for
whom
it
is
prepared
of
my
Mat20:24
And
when
the
ten
heard
they
were
moved
with
indignation
against
the
two
Mat20:25
But
Jesus
called
them
unto
and
Ye
know
that
the
princes
of
the
Gentiles
exercise
dominion
over
and
they
t
hat
are
great
exercise
authority
upon
Mat20:26
But
it
shall
not
be
so
among
but
whosoever
will
be
great
among
let
him
be
your
Mat20:27
And
whosoever
will
be
chief
among
let
him
be
your
Mat20:28
Even
as
the
Son
of
man
came
not
to
be
ministered
but
to
and
to
give
his
life
a
ransom
for
Mat20:29
And
as
they
departed
from
a
great
multitude
followed
Mat20:30
two
blind
men
sitting
by
the
way
when
they
heard
that
Jesus
passed
cried
Have
mercy
on
O
thou
son
of
Mat20:31
And
the
multitude
rebuked
because
they
should
hold
their
but
they
cried
the
Have
mercy
on
O
thou
son
of
Mat20:32
And
Jesus
stood
and
called
and
What
will
ye
that
I
shall
do
unto
Mat20:33
They
say
unto
that
our
eyes
may
be
Mat20:34
So
Jesus
had
compassion
on
and
touched
their
and
immediately
their
eyes
received
and
they
followed
Mat21:1
And
when
they
drew
nigh
unto
and
were
come
to
Bethphage,
unto
the
mount
of
then
sent
Jesus
two
disciples
,
Mat21:2
Saying
unto
Go
into
the
village
over
against
and
straightway
ye
shall
find
an
ass
and
a
colt
with
loo
se
and
bring
them
unto
Mat21:3
And
if
any
man
say
ought
unto
ye
shall
The
Lord
hath
need
of
and
straightway
he
will
send
Mat21:4
All
this
was
that
it
might
be
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
by
the
Mat21:5
Tell
ye
the
daughter
of
thy
King
cometh
unto
and
sitting
upon
an
and
a
colt
the
foal
of
an
a
ss.
Mat21:6
And
the
disciples
and
did
as
Jesus
commanded
Mat21:7
And
brought
the
and
the
and
put
on
them
their
and
they
set
him
Mat21:8
And
a
very
great
multitude
spread
their
garments
in
the
others
cut
down
branches
from
the
and
strawed
them
in
t
he
Mat21:9
And
the
multitudes
that
went
and
that
Hosanna
to
the
son
of
Blessed
is
he
that
come
th
in
the
name
of
the
Hosanna
in
the
Mat21:10
And
when
he
was
come
into
all
the
city
was
Who
is
Mat21:11
And
the
multitude
This
is
Jesus
the
prophet
of
Nazareth
of
Mat21:12
And
Jesus
went
into
the
temple
of
and
cast
out
all
them
that
sold
and
bought
in
the
and
overthrew
the
tables
of
the
moneychangers,
and
the
seats
of
them
that
sold
Mat21:13
And
said
unto
It
is
My
house
shall
be
called
the
house
of
but
ye
have
made
it
a
den
of
Mat21:14
And
the
blind
and
the
lame
came
to
him
in
the
and
he
healed
Mat21:15
And
when
the
chief
priests
and
scribes
saw
the
wonderful
things
that
he
and
the
children
crying
in
the
and
sa
ying,
Hosanna
to
the
son
of
they
were
sore
Mat21:16
And
said
unto
Hearest
thou
what
these
And
Jesus
saith
unto
have
ye
never
Out
of
the
mouth
of
ba
bes
and
sucklings
thou
hast
perfected
Mat21:17
And
he
left
and
went
out
of
the
city
into
and
he
lodged
Mat21:18
Now
in
the
morning
as
he
returned
into
the
he
Mat21:19
And
when
he
saw
a
fig
tree
in
the
he
came
to
and
found
nothing
but
leaves
and
said
unto
Let
no
fruit
grow
on
thee
henceforward
for
And
presently
the
fig
tree
withered
Mat21:20
And
when
the
disciples
saw
they
How
soon
is
the
fig
tree
withered
Mat21:21
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
Verily
I
say
unto
If
ye
have
and
doubt
ye
shall
not
only
do
this
which
is
done
to
the
fig
but
also
if
ye
shall
say
unto
this
Be
thou
and
be
thou
cast
into
the
it
shall
be
Mat21:22
And
all
whatsoever
ye
shall
ask
in
ye
shall
Mat21:23
And
when
he
was
come
into
the
the
chief
priests
and
the
elders
of
the
people
came
unto
him
as
he
was
and
By
what
authority
doest
thou
these
and
who
gave
thee
this
Mat21:24
And
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
I
also
will
ask
you
one
which
if
ye
tell
I
in
like
wise
will
tell
you
by
what
authority
I
do
these
Mat21:25
The
baptism
of
whence
was
from
or
of
And
they
reasoned
with
If
we
shall
Fr
om
he
will
say
unto
Why
did
ye
not
then
believe
Mat21:26
But
if
we
shall
Of
we
fear
the
for
all
hold
John
as
a
Mat21:27
And
they
answered
and
We
cannot
And
he
said
unto
Neither
tell
I
you
by
what
authority
I
do
these
Mat21:28
But
what
think
A
certain
man
had
two
and
he
came
to
the
and
go
work
to
day
in
my
Mat21:29
He
answered
and
I
will
but
afterward
he
and
Mat21:30
And
he
came
to
the
and
said
And
he
answered
and
I
and
went
Mat21:31
Whether
of
them
twain
did
the
will
of
his
They
say
unto
The
Jesus
saith
unto
Verily
I
say
unto
y
ou,
That
the
publicans
and
the
harlots
go
into
the
kingdom
of
God
before
Mat21:32
For
John
came
unto
you
in
the
way
of
and
ye
believed
him
but
the
publicans
and
the
harlots
believed
hi
m:
and
when
ye
had
seen
repented
not
that
ye
might
believe
Mat21:33
Hear
another
There
was
a
certain
which
planted
a
and
hedged
it
round
and
digged
a
w
inepress
in
and
built
a
and
let
it
out
to
and
went
into
a
far
Mat21:34
And
when
the
time
of
the
fruit
drew
he
sent
his
servants
to
the
that
they
might
receive
the
fruits
of
it
.
Mat21:35
And
the
husbandmen
took
his
and
beat
and
killed
and
stoned
Mat21:36
he
sent
other
servants
more
than
the
and
they
did
unto
them
Mat21:37
But
last
of
all
he
sent
unto
them
his
They
will
reverence
my
Mat21:38
But
when
the
husbandmen
saw
the
they
said
among
This
is
the
let
us
kill
and
let
us
seize
on
his
Mat21:39
And
they
caught
and
cast
him
out
of
the
and
slew
Mat21:40
When
the
lord
therefore
of
the
vineyard
what
will
he
do
unto
those
Mat21:41
They
say
unto
He
will
miserably
destroy
those
wicked
and
will
let
out
his
vineyard
unto
other
which
shall
render
him
the
fruits
in
their
Mat21:42
Jesus
saith
unto
Did
ye
never
read
in
the
The
stone
which
the
builders
the
same
is
become
the
head
of
the
this
is
the
Lord's
and
it
is
marvellous
in
our
Mat21:43
Therefore
say
I
unto
The
kingdom
of
God
shall
be
taken
from
and
given
to
a
nation
bringing
forth
the
fruits
ther
eof.
Mat21:44
And
whosoever
shall
fall
on
this
stone
shall
be
but
on
whomsoever
it
shall
it
will
grind
him
to
Mat21:45
And
when
the
chief
priests
and
Pharisees
had
heard
his
they
perceived
that
he
spake
of
Mat21:46
But
when
they
sought
to
lay
hands
on
they
feared
the
because
they
took
him
for
a
Mat22:1
And
Jesus
answered
and
spake
unto
them
again
by
and
Mat22:2
The
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
unto
a
certain
which
made
a
marriage
for
his
Mat22:3
And
sent
forth
his
servants
to
call
them
that
were
bidden
to
the
and
they
would
not
Mat22:4
he
sent
forth
other
Tell
them
which
are
I
have
prepared
my
my
oxen
and
my
fatlings
are
and
all
things
are
come
unto
the
Mat22:5
But
they
made
light
of
and
went
their
one
to
his
another
to
his
Mat22:6
And
the
remnant
took
his
and
entreated
them
and
slew
Mat22:7
But
when
the
king
heard
he
was
and
he
sent
forth
his
and
destroyed
those
and
burned
up
t
heir
Mat22:8
Then
saith
he
to
his
The
wedding
is
but
they
which
were
bidden
were
not
Mat22:9
Go
ye
therefore
into
the
and
as
many
as
ye
shall
bid
to
the
Mat22:10
So
those
servants
went
out
into
the
and
gathered
together
all
as
many
as
they
both
bad
and
and
the
wedding
was
furnished
with
Mat22:11
And
when
the
king
came
in
to
see
the
he
saw
there
a
man
which
had
not
on
a
wedding
Mat22:12
And
he
saith
unto
how
camest
thou
in
hither
not
having
a
wedding
And
he
was
Mat22:13
Then
said
the
king
to
the
Bind
him
hand
and
and
take
him
and
cast
him
into
outer
there
sha
ll
be
weeping
and
gnashing
of
Mat22:14
For
many
are
but
few
are
Mat22:15
Then
went
the
Pharisees,
and
took
counsel
how
they
might
entangle
him
in
his
Mat22:16
And
they
sent
out
unto
him
their
disciples
with
the
Herodians,
we
know
that
thou
art
and
teachest
th
e
way
of
God
in
neither
carest
thou
for
any
for
thou
regardest
not
the
person
of
Mat22:17
Tell
us
What
thinkest
Is
it
lawful
to
give
tribute
unto
or
Mat22:18
But
Jesus
perceived
their
and
Why
tempt
ye
ye
Mat22:19
Shew
me
the
tribute
And
they
brought
unto
him
a
Mat22:20
And
he
saith
unto
Whose
is
this
image
and
Mat22:21
They
say
unto
Caesar's.
Then
saith
he
unto
Render
therefore
unto
Caesar
the
things
which
are
Caesar's;
and
unto
God
the
things
that
are
Mat22:22
When
they
had
heard
these
they
and
left
and
went
their
Mat22:23
The
same
day
came
to
him
the
Sadducees,
which
say
that
there
is
no
and
asked
Mat22:24
Moses
If
a
man
having
no
his
brother
shall
marry
his
and
raise
up
seed
unto
his
Mat22:25
Now
there
were
with
us
seven
and
the
when
he
had
married
a
having
no
left
his
wife
unto
his
Mat22:26
Likewise
the
second
and
the
unto
the
Mat22:27
And
last
of
all
the
woman
died
Mat22:28
Therefore
in
the
resurrection
whose
wife
shall
she
be
of
the
for
they
all
had
Mat22:29
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
Ye
do
not
knowing
the
nor
the
power
of
Mat22:30
For
in
the
resurrection
they
neither
nor
are
given
in
but
are
as
the
angels
of
God
in
Mat22:31
But
as
touching
the
resurrection
of
the
have
ye
not
read
that
which
was
spoken
unto
you
by
Mat22:32
I
am
the
God
of
and
the
God
of
and
the
God
of
God
is
not
the
God
of
the
but
of
the
Mat22:33
And
when
the
multitude
heard
they
were
astonished
at
his
Mat22:34
But
when
the
Pharisees
had
heard
that
he
had
put
the
Sadducees
to
they
were
gathered
Mat22:35
Then
one
of
which
was
a
asked
him
a
tempting
and
Mat22:36
which
is
the
great
commandment
in
the
Mat22:37
Jesus
said
unto
Thou
shalt
love
the
Lord
thy
God
with
all
thy
and
with
all
thy
and
with
all
thy
Mat22:38
This
is
the
first
and
great
Mat22:39
And
the
second
is
like
unto
Thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbour
as
Mat22:40
On
these
two
commandments
hang
all
the
law
and
the
Mat22:41
While
the
Pharisees
were
gathered
Jesus
asked
Mat22:42
What
think
ye
of
whose
son
is
They
say
unto
The
son
of
Mat22:43
He
saith
unto
How
then
doth
David
in
spirit
call
him
Mat22:44
The
LORD
said
unto
my
Sit
thou
on
my
right
till
I
make
thine
enemies
thy
Mat22:45
If
David
then
call
him
how
is
he
his
Mat22:46
And
no
man
was
able
to
answer
him
a
neither
durst
any
man
from
that

Then
spake
Jesus
to
the
and
to
his
Mat23:2
The
scribes
and
the
Pharisees
sit
in
Mat23:3
All
therefore
whatsoever
they
bid
you
that
observe
and
but
do
not
ye
after
their
for
they
and
do
n
ot.
Mat23:4
For
they
bind
heavy
burdens
and
grievous
to
be
and
lay
them
on
men's
but
they
themselves
will
not
move
th
em
with
one
of
their
Mat23:5
But
all
their
works
they
do
for
to
be
seen
of
they
make
broad
their
phylacteries,
and
enlarge
the
borders
of
their
gar
ments,
Mat23:6
And
love
the
uppermost
rooms
at
and
the
chief
seats
in
the
Mat23:7
And
greetings
in

to

called
of
Mat23:8
But
be
not
ye
called
for
one

your

and
all

are
Mat23:9
And
call
no
man
your
father
upon

for
one

your
which
is
in
Mat23:10
Neither
be
ye
called
for

your

Mat23:11
But
he
that
is
greatest
among
you
shall
be
your
Mat23:12
And
whosoever
shall
exalt
himself
shall
be
and
he
that
shall
humble
himself
shall
be
Mat23:13
But
woe
unto
scribes
and
Pharisees,
for
ye
shut
up
the
kingdom
of
heaven
against
for
ye
neither
go
i
n
neither
suffer
ye
them
that
are
entering
to
go
Mat23:14
Woe
unto
scribes
and
Pharisees,
for
ye
devour
and
for
a
pretence
make
long
theref
ore
ye
shall
receive
the
greater
Mat23:15
Woe
unto
scribes
and

for
ye
compass
sea
and
land
to
make
one
and
when
he
is
y
e
make
him
twofold
more
the
child
of
hell
than
Mat23:16
Woe
unto
ye
blind
which
Whosoever
shall
swear
by
the
it
is
but
whosoever
shall
swear
by
the
gold
of
the

Ye
fools
and
for
whether
is
the
or

temple
that
sanctifieth
the
Mat23:18
Whosoever
shall
swear
by

whosoever
sweareth
by
the
gift
that

Mat23:19
Ye
fools

Whoso

And

And

Woe
unto
scribes
and
Pharisees,
for
ye
pay
tithe
of
mint
and
anise
and
cummin,
and
have
omitted
the
weigh
tier
matters
of
the
and
these
ought
ye
to
have
and
not
to

Ye
blind

Woe
unto
scribes
and
Pharisees,
for
ye
make
clean
the
outside
of
the
cup
and
of
the
but
within
t
hey
are
full
of
extortion
and
Mat23:26
Thou
blind
cleanse
first
that
which
is
within
the
cup
and
that
the
outside
of
them
may
be
clean
Mat23:27
Woe
unto
scribes
and
Pharisees,
for
ye
are
like
unto
whited
which
indeed
appear
beautiful
out
but
are
within
full
of
dead
men's
and
of
all
Mat23:28
Even
so
ye
also
outwardly
appear
righteous
unto
but
within
ye
are
full
of
hypocrisy
and
Mat23:29
Woe
unto
scribes
and
Pharisees,
because
ye
build
the
tombs
of
the
and
garnish
the
sepulchres
of
the
Mat23:30
And
If
we
had
been
in
the
days
of
our
we
would
not
have
been
partakers
with
them
in
the
blood
of
the
prophet
s.
Mat23:31
Wherefore
ye
be
witnesses
unto
that
ye
are
the
children
of
them
which
killed
the
Mat23:32
Fill
ye
up
then
the
measure
of
your
Mat23:33
Ye
ye
generation
of
how
can
ye
escape
the
damnation
of
Mat23:34
I
send
unto
you
and
wise
and
and
some
of
them
ye
shall
kill
and
and
so
me
of
them
shall
ye
scourge
in
your
and
persecute
them
from
city
to
Mat23:35
That
upon
you
may
come
all
the
righteous
blood
shed
upon
the
from
the
blood
of
righteous
Abel
unto
the
blood
of
Zac
harias
son
of
Barachias,
whom
ye
slew
between
the
temple
and
the
Mat23:36
Verily
I
say
unto
All
these
things
shall
come
upon
this
Mat23:37
O
thou
that
killest
the
and
stonest
them
which
are
sent
unto
how
often
would
I
have
gathered
thy
children
even
as
a
hen
gathereth
her
chickens
under
her
and
ye
would
Mat23:38
your
house
is
left
unto
you

For
I
say
unto
Ye
shall
not
see
me
till
ye
shall
Blessed
is
he
that
cometh
in
the
name
of
the
Mat24:1
And
Jesus
went
and
departed
from
the
and
his
disciples
came
to
him
for
to
shew
him
the
buildings
of
the
temple
.
Mat24:2
And
Jesus
said
unto
See
ye
not
all
these
verily
I
say
unto
There
shall
not
be
left
here
one
stone
upon
a
nother,
that
shall
not
be
thrown
Mat24:3
And
as
he
sat
upon
the
mount
of
the
disciples
came
unto
him
Tell
when
shall
these
things
and
what
shall
be
the
sign
of
thy
and
of
the
end
of
the
Mat24:4
And
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
Take
heed
that
no
man
deceive
Mat24:5
For
many
shall
come
in
my
I
am
and
shall
deceive
Mat24:6
And
ye
shall
hear
of
wars
and
rumours
of
see
that
ye
be
not
for
all
these
things
must
come
to
but
the
end
is
not
Mat24:7
For
nation
shall
rise
against
and
kingdom
against
and
there
shall
be
and
and
earthqu
akes,
in
divers
Mat24:8
All
these
are
the
beginning
of
Mat24:9
Then
shall
they
deliver
you
up
to
be
and
shall
kill
and
ye
shall
be
hated
of
all
nations
for
my
name's
sake
.
Mat24:10
And
then
shall
many
be
and
shall
betray
one
and
shall
hate
one
Mat24:11
And
many
false
prophets
shall
and
shall
deceive
Mat24:12
And
because
iniquity
shall
the
love
of
many
shall
wax
Mat24:13
But
he
that
shall
endure
unto
the
the
same
shall
be
Mat24:14
And
this
gospel
of
the
kingdom
shall
be
preached
in
all
the
world
for
a
witness
unto
all
and
then
shall
the
end
c
ome.
Mat24:15
When
ye
therefore
shall
see
the
abomination
of
spoken
of
by
Daniel
the
stand
in
the
holy
(whos
o
readeth,
let
him
understand:)
Mat24:16
Then
let
them
which
be
in
Judaea
flee
into
the
Mat24:17
Let
him
which
is
on
the
housetop
not
come
down
to
take
any
thing
out
of
his
Mat24:18
Neither
let
him
which
is
in
the
field
return
back
to
take
his
Mat24:19
And
woe
unto
them
that
are
with
and
to
them
that
give
suck
in
those
Mat24:20
But
pray
ye
that
your
flight
be
not
in
the
neither
on
the
sabbath
Mat24:21
For
then
shall
be
great
such
as
was
not
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
to
this
nor
ever
shall
Mat24:22
And
except
those
days
should
be
there
should
no
flesh
be
but
for
the
elect's
sake
those
days
shall
be
sh
ortened.
Mat24:23
Then
if
any
man
shall
say
unto
here
is
or
believe
it
Mat24:24
For
there
shall
arise
false
Christs,
and
false
and
shall
shew
great
signs
and
insomuch
if
it
were
they
shall
deceive
the
very
Mat24:25
I
have
told
you
Mat24:26
Wherefore
if
they
shall
say
unto
he
is
in
the
go
not
he
is
in
the
secret
bel
ieve
it
Mat24:27
For
as
the
lightning
cometh
out
of
the
and
shineth
even
unto
the
so
shall
also
the
coming
of
the
Son
of
man
be
.
Mat24:28
For
wheresoever
the
carcase
there
will
the
eagles
be
gathered
Mat24:29
Immediately
after
the
tribulation
of
those
days
shall
the
sun
be
and
the
moon
shall
not
give
her
and
the
stars
shall
fall
from
and
the
powers
of
the
heavens
shall
be
Mat24:30
And
then
shall
appear
the
sign
of
the
Son
of
man
in
and
then
shall
all
the
tribes
of
the
earth
and
they
sha
ll
see
the
Son
of
man
coming
in
the
clouds
of
heaven
with
power
and
great
Mat24:31
And
he
shall
send
his
angels
with
a
great
sound
of
a
and
they
shall
gather
together
his
elect
from
the
four
winds
,
from
one
end
of
heaven
to
the
Mat24:32
Now
learn
a
parable
of
the
fig
When
his
branch
is
yet
and
putteth
forth
ye
know
that
summer
is
Mat24:33
So
likewise
when
ye
shall
see
all
these
know
that
it
is
even
at
the
Mat24:34
Verily
I
say
unto
This
generation
shall
not
till
all
these
things
be
Mat24:35
Heaven
and
earth
shall
pass
but
my
words
shall
not
pass
Mat24:36
But
of
that
day
and
hour
knoweth
no
not
the
angels
of
but
my
Father
Mat24:37
But
as
the
days
of
Noe
so
shall
also
the
coming
of
the
Son
of
man
Mat24:38
For
as
in
the
days
that
were
before
the
flood
they
were
eating
and
marrying
and
giving
in
until
the
da
y
that
Noe
entered
into
the
Mat24:39
And
knew
not
until
the
flood
and
took
them
all
so
shall
also
the
coming
of
the
Son
of
man
Mat24:40
Then
shall
two
be
in
the
the
one
shall
be
and
the
other
Mat24:41
Two
women
shall
be
grinding
at
the
the
one
shall
be
and
the
other
Mat24:42
Watch
for
ye
know
not
what
hour
your
Lord
doth
Mat24:43
But
know
that
if
the
goodman
of
the
house
had
known
in
what
watch
the
thief
would
he
would
have
and
w
ould
not
have
suffered
his
house
to
be
broken
Mat24:44
Therefore
be
ye
also
for
in
such
an
hour
as
ye
think
not
the
Son
of
man
Mat24:45
Who
then
is
a
faithful
and
wise
whom
his
lord
hath
made
ruler
over
his
to
give
them
meat
in
due
season
?
Mat24:46
Blessed
is
that
whom
his
lord
when
he
cometh
shall
find
so
Mat24:47
Verily
I
say
unto
That
he
shall
make
him
ruler
over
all
his
Mat24:48
But
and
if
that
evil
servant
shall
say
in
his
My
lord
delayeth
his
Mat24:49
And
shall
begin
to
smite
his
fellowservants,
and
to
eat
and
drink
with
the
Mat24:50
The
lord
of
that
servant
shall
come
in
a
day
when
he
looketh
not
for
and
in
an
hour
that
he
is
not
aware
Mat24:51
And
shall
cut
him
and
appoint
him
his
portion
with
the
there
shall
be
weeping
and
gnashing
of
Mat25:1
Then
shall
the
kingdom
of
heaven
be
likened
unto
ten
which
took
their
and
went
forth
to
meet
the
bridegroom
.
Mat25:2
And
five
of
them
were
and
five
were
Mat25:3
They
that
were
foolish
took
their
and
took
no
oil
with
Mat25:4
But
the
wise
took
oil
in
their
vessels
with
their
Mat25:5
While
the
bridegroom
they
all
slumbered
and
Mat25:6
And
at
midnight
there
was
a
cry
the
bridegroom
go
ye
out
to
meet
Mat25:7
Then
all
those
virgins
and
trimmed
their
Mat25:8
And
the
foolish
said
unto
the
Give
us
of
your
for
our
lamps
are
gone
Mat25:9
But
the
wise
Not
lest
there
be
not
enough
for
us
and
but
go
ye
rather
to
them
that
and
buy
for
Mat25:10
And
while
they
went
to
the
bridegroom
and
they
that
were
ready
went
in
with
him
to
the
and
the
door
w
as
Mat25:11
Afterward
came
also
the
other
open
to
Mat25:12
But
he
answered
and
Verily
I
say
unto
I
know
you
Mat25:13
Watch
for
ye
know
neither
the
day
nor
the
hour
wherein
the
Son
of
man
Mat25:14
For
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
as
a
man
travelling
into
a
far
who
called
his
own
and
delivered
unto
them
his
Mat25:15
And
unto
one
he
gave
five
to
another
and
to
another
to
every
man
according
to
his
several
and
straightway
took
his
Mat25:16
Then
he
that
had
received
the
five
talents
went
and
traded
with
the
and
made
them
other
five
Mat25:17
And
likewise
he
that
had
received
he
also
gained
other
Mat25:18
But
he
that
had
received
one
went
and
digged
in
the
and
hid
his
lord's
Mat25:19
After
a
long
time
the
lord
of
those
servants
and
reckoneth
with
Mat25:20
And
so
he
that
had
received
five
talents
came
and
brought
other
five
thou
deliveredst
unto
me
five
I
have
gained
beside
them
five
talents
Mat25:21
His
lord
said
unto
Well
thou
good
and
faithful
thou
hast
been
faithful
over
a
few
I
will
make
thee
ruler
over
many
enter
thou
into
the
joy
of
thy
Mat25:22
He
also
that
had
received
two
talents
came
and
thou
deliveredst
unto
me
two
I
have
gained
two
other
talents
beside
Mat25:23
His
lord
said
unto
Well
good
and
faithful
thou
hast
been
faithful
over
a
few
I
will
make
thee
ruler
over
many
enter
thou
into
the
joy
of
thy
Mat25:24
Then
he
which
had
received
the
one
talent
came
and
I
knew
thee
that
thou
art
an
hard
reaping
where
thou
h
ast
not
and
gathering
where
thou
hast
not
strawed:
Mat25:25
And
I
was
and
went
and
hid
thy
talent
in
the
there
thou
hast
that
is
Mat25:26
His
lord
answered
and
said
unto
Thou
wicked
and
slothful
thou
knewest
that
I
reap
where
I
sowed
and
gat
her
where
I
have
not
strawed:
Mat25:27
Thou
oughtest
therefore
to
have
put
my
money
to
the
and
then
at
my
coming
I
should
have
received
mine
own
with
Mat25:28
Take
therefore
the
talent
from
and
give
it
unto
him
which
hath
ten
Mat25:29
For
unto
every
one
that
hath
shall
be
and
he
shall
have
but
from
him
that
hath
not
shall
be
taken
away
e
ven
that
which
he
Mat25:30
And
cast
ye
the
unprofitable
servant
into
outer
there
shall
be
weeping
and
gnashing
of
Mat25:31
When
the
Son
of
man
shall
come
in
his
and
all
the
holy
angels
with
then
shall
he
sit
upon
the
throne
of
his
gl
ory:
Mat25:32
And
before
him
shall
be
gathered
all
and
he
shall
separate
them
one
from
as
a
shepherd
divideth
his
shee
p
from
the
Mat25:33
And
he
shall
set
the
sheep
on
his
right
but
the
goats
on
the
Mat25:34
Then
shall
the
King
say
unto
them
on
his
right
ye
blessed
of
my
inherit
the
kingdom
prepared
for
you
f
rom
the
foundation
of
the
Mat25:35
For
I
was
an
hungred,
and
ye
gave
me
I
was
and
ye
gave
me
I
was
a
and
ye
took
me
Mat25:36
and
ye
clothed
I
was
and
ye
visited
I
was
in
and
ye
came
unto
Mat25:37
Then
shall
the
righteous
answer
when
saw
we
thee
an
hungred,
and
fed
or
and
gave
thee
dr
Mat25:38
When
saw
we
thee
a
and
took
thee
or
and
clothed
Mat25:39
Or
when
saw
we
thee
or
in
and
came
unto
Mat25:40
And
the
King
shall
answer
and
say
unto
Verily
I
say
unto
Inasmuch
as
ye
have
done
it
unto
one
of
the
least
of
t

unto

For
I
was
an

and

gave

ye
gave

I
was

ye
took

not
and
ye
clothed

Then
shall
they
also
answer
when
saw
we
thee
an
hungred,
or
or
a
or
or
or
in
and
did
not
minister
unto
Mat25:45
Then
shall
he
answer
Verily
I
say
unto
Inasmuch
as
ye
did
it
not
to
one
of
the
least
of
ye
did
i
t
not
to
Mat25:46
And
these
shall
go
away
into
everlasting
but
the
righteous
into
life
Mat26:1
And
it
came
to
when
Jesus
had
finished
all
these
he
said
unto
his
Mat26:2
Ye
know
that
after
two
days
is
the
feast
of
the
and
the
Son
of
man
is
betrayed
to
be
Mat26:3
Then
assembled
together
the
chief
and
the
and
the
elders
of
the
unto
the
palace
of
the
high
pries
t,
who
was
called
Mat26:4
And
consulted
that
they
might
take
Jesus
by
and
kill
Mat26:5
But
they
Not
on
the
feast
lest
there
be
an
uproar
among
the
Mat26:6
Now
when
Jesus
was
in
in
the
house
of
Simon
the
Mat26:7
There
came
unto
him
a
woman
having
an
alabaster
box
of
very
precious
and
poured
it
on
his
as
he
sat
at
meat
.
Mat26:8
But
when
his
disciples
saw
they
had
To
what
purpose
is
this
Mat26:9
For
this
ointment
might
have
been
sold
for
and
given
to
the
Mat26:10
When
Jesus
understood
he
said
unto
Why
trouble
ye
the
for
she
hath
wrought
a
good
work
upon
Mat26:11
For
ye
have
the
poor
always
with
but
me
ye
have
not
Mat26:12
For
in
that
she
hath
poured
this
ointment
on
my
she
did
it
for
my
Mat26:13
Verily
I
say
unto
Wheresoever
this
gospel
shall
be
preached
in
the
whole
there
shall
also
that
this
woma
n
hath
be
told
for
a
memorial
of
Mat26:14
Then
one
of
the
called
Judas
went
unto
the
chief
Mat26:15
And
said
unto
What
will
ye
give
and
I
will
deliver
him
unto
And
they
covenanted
with
him
for
thirty
pieces
of
Mat26:16
And
from
that
time
he
sought
opportunity
to
betray
Mat26:17
Now
the
first
day
of
the
feast
of
unleavened
bread
the
disciples
came
to
saying
unto
Where
wilt
thou
that
we
p
repare
for
thee
to
eat
the
Mat26:18
And
he
Go
into
the
city
to
such
a
and
say
unto
The
Master
My
time
is
at
I
will
keep
the
passo
ver
at
thy
house
with
my
Mat26:19
And
the
disciples
did
as
Jesus
had
appointed
and
they
made
ready
the
Mat26:20
Now
when
the
even
was
he
sat
down
with
the
Mat26:21
And
as
they
did
he
Verily
I
say
unto
that
one
of
you
shall
betray
Mat26:22
And
they
were
exceeding
and
began
every
one
of
them
to
say
unto
is
it
Mat26:23
And
he
answered
and
He
that
dippeth
his
hand
with
me
in
the
the
same
shall
betray
Mat26:24
The
Son
of
man
goeth
as
it
is
written
of
but
woe
unto
that
man
by
whom
the
Son
of
man
is
it
had
been
good
f
or
that
man
if
he
had
not
been
Mat26:25
Then
which
betrayed
answered
and
is
it
He
said
unto
Thou
hast
Mat26:26
And
as
they
were
Jesus
took
and
blessed
and
brake
and
gave
it
to
the
and
eat
;
this
is
my
Mat26:27
And
he
took
the
and
gave
and
gave
it
to
Drink
ye
all
of
Mat26:28
For
this
is
my
blood
of
the
new
which
is
shed
for
many
for
the
remission
of
Mat26:29
But
I
say
unto
I
will
not
drink
henceforth
of
this
fruit
of
the
until
that
day
when
I
drink
it
new
with
you
in
my
Father's
Mat26:30
And
when
they
had
sung
an
they
went
out
into
the
mount
of
Mat26:31
Then
saith
Jesus
unto
All
ye
shall
be
offended
because
of
me
this
for
it
is
I
will
smite
the
shepher
d,
and
the
sheep
of
the
flock
shall
be
scattered
Mat26:32
But
after
I
am
risen
I
will
go
before
you
into
Mat26:33
Peter
answered
and
said
unto
Though
all
men
shall
be
offended
because
of
yet
will
I
never
be
Mat26:34
Jesus
said
unto
Verily
I
say
unto
That
this
before
the
cock
thou
shalt
deny
me
Mat26:35
Peter
said
unto
Though
I
should
die
with
yet
will
I
not
deny
Likewise
also
said
all
the
Mat26:36
Then
cometh
Jesus
with
them
unto
a
place
called
and
saith
unto
the
Sit
ye
while
I
go
and
pray
Mat26:37
And
he
took
with
him
Peter
and
the
two
sons
of
and
began
to
be
sorrowful
and
very
Mat26:38
Then
saith
he
unto
My
soul
is
exceeding
even
unto
tarry
ye
and
watch
with
Mat26:39
And
he
went
a
little
and
fell
on
his
and
O
my
if
it
be
let
this
cup
pass
from
nevertheless
not
as
I
but
as
thou
Mat26:40
And
he
cometh
unto
the
and
findeth
them
and
saith
unto
could
ye
not
watch
with
me
one
hour
?
Mat26:41
Watch
and
that
ye
enter
not
into
the
spirit
indeed
is
but
the
flesh
is
Mat26:42
He
went
away
again
the
second
and
O
my
if
this
cup
may
not
pass
away
from
except
I
drink
thy
will
be
Mat26:43
And
he
came
and
found
them
asleep
for
their
eyes
were
Mat26:44
And
he
left
and
went
away
and
prayed
the
third
saying
the
same
Mat26:45
Then
cometh
he
to
his
and
saith
unto
Sleep
on
and
take
your

hour

at

t

of
man

betrayed
into

hands
of

let
us
be

is
at

that
doth
betray

And
while

of

and
with
him
a
great
multitude
with
swords
and
from
th

chief
priests
and

Now
he
that
betrayed
him
gave
them
a

I
shall
that
same
is

Mat26:49
And
forthwith
he
came
to
and
and
kissed
Mat26:50
And
Jesus
said
unto
wherefore
art
thou
Then
came
and
laid
hands
on
and
took
Mat26:51
one
of
them
which
were
with
Jesus
stretched
out

drew
his

struck
a
servant
of
the
hig

and
smote
off
his

Then
said
Jesus
unto
Put
up
again

into

for
all
they
that

perish
with

Mat26:53
Thinkest
thou
that
I
cannot
now
pray
to
my

he
shall
presently
give
me
more
than
twelve
legions
of

But
how
then
shall
the
scriptures
be
that
thus
it
must

In
that
same
hour
said
Jesus
to

all

And
they
that
had
laid

on

led
him
away
to
Caiaphas

high
where
the
scribes
and
the
elders
were

But
Peter
followed

And
This

And
the

said
unto

But
Jesus

the

answered
and
said
unto

He
is
guilty
of

Then
did
they
spit

others
smote

of

Now
Peter
sat
without

a
damsel
came
unto

But
he
denied

And
after
a
while
came
unto

said
to

Then

And
Peter
remembered
the
word

And
he
went
and
wept
Mat27:1
When
the
morning
was

he
saw
that

And
he
cast
down
the
pieces

And
the

And
when
he
was
accused
of
the
chief
priests
and
he
answered
Mat27:13
Then
said
Pilate
unto
Hearest
thou
not

many
things

And
he
answered
him
to

Pilate
said
unto
Whom

For
he
knew

But
the

The
governor
answered

said
unto

Then
the
soldiers

the
earth

and
the
rocks
r
ent;
Mat27:52
And
the
graves
were
and
many
bodies
of
the
saints
which
slept
Mat27:53
And
came
out
of
the
graves
after
his
and
went
into
the
holy
and
appeared
unto
Mat27:54
Now
when
the
and
they
that
were
with
watching
saw
the
and
those
things
that
were
they
feared
Truly
this
was
the
Son
of
Mat27:55
And
many
women
were
there
beholding
afar
which
followed
Jesus
from
ministering
unto
Mat27:56
Among
which
was
Mary
and
Mary
the
mother
of
James
and
Joses,
and
the
mother
of
Zebedee's
Mat27:57
When
the
even
was
there
came
a
rich
man
of
Arimathaea,
named
who
also
himself
was
Mat27:58
He
went
to
and
begged
the
body
of
Then
Pilate
commanded
the
body
to
be
Mat27:59
And
when
Joseph
had
taken
the
he
wrapped
it
in
a
clean
linen
Mat27:60
And
laid
it
in
his
own
new
which
he
had
hewn
out
in
the
and
he
rolled
a
great
stone
to
the
door
of
the
sepulch
and
Mat27:61
And
there
was
Mary
and
the
other
sitting
over
against
the
Mat27:62
Now
the
next
that
followed
the
day
of
the
the
chief
priests
and
Pharisees
came
together
unto
Mat27:63
we
remember
that
that
deceiver
while
he
was
yet
After
three
days
I
will
rise
Mat27:64
Command
therefore
that
the
sepulchre
be
made
sure
until
the
third
lest
his
disciples
come
by
and
steal
him
awa
y,
and
say
unto
the
He
is
risen
from
the
so
the
last
error
shall
be
worse
than
the
Mat27:65
Pilate
said
unto
Ye
have
a
go
your
make
it
as
sure
as
ye
Mat27:66
So
they
and
made
the
sepulchre
sealing
the
and
setting
a
Mat28:1
In
the
end
of
the
as
it
began
to
dawn
toward
the
first
day
of
the
came
Mary
Magdalene
and
the
other
Mary
to
see
the
Mat28:2
there
was
a
great
for
the
angel
of
the
Lord
descended
from
and
came
and
rolled
back
the
st
one
from
the
and
sat
upon
Mat28:3
His
countenance
was
like
and
his
raiment
white
as
Mat28:4
And
for
fear
of
him
the
keepers
did
and
became
as
dead
Mat28:5
And
the
angel
answered
and
said
unto
the
Fear
not
for
I
know
that
ye
seek
which
was
Mat28:6
He
is
not
for
he
is
as
he
see
the
place
where
the
Lord
Mat28:7
And
go
and
tell
his
disciples
that
he
is
risen
from
the
he
goeth
before
you
into
there
shall
ye
see
I
have
told
Mat28:8
And
they
departed
quickly
from
the
sepulchre
with
fear
and
great
and
did
run
to
bring
his
disciples
Mat28:9
And
as
they
went
to
tell
his
Jesus
met
All
And
they
came
and
held
him
by
the
a
nd
worshipped
Mat28:10
Then
said
Jesus
unto
Be
not
go
tell
my
brethren
that
they
go
into
and
there
shall
they
see
Mat28:11
Now
when
they
were
some
of
the
watch
came
into
the
and
shewed
unto
the
chief
priests
all
the
things
t
hat
were
Mat28:12
And
when
they
were
assembled
with
the
and
had
taken
they
gave
large
money
unto
the
Mat28:13
Say
His
disciples
came
by
and
stole
him
away
while
we
Mat28:14
And
if
this
come
to
the
governor's
we
will
persuade
and
secure
Mat28:15
So
they
took
the
and
did
as
they
were
and
this
saying
is
commonly
reported
among
the
Jews
until
this
Mat28:16
Then
the
eleven
disciples
went
away
into
into
a
mountain
where
Jesus
had
appointed
Mat28:17
And
when
they
saw
they
worshipped
but
some
Mat28:18
And
Jesus
came
and
spake
unto
All
power
is
given
unto
me
in
heaven
and
in
Mat28:19
Go
ye
and
teach
all
baptizing
them
in
the
name
of
the
and
of
the
and
of
the
Holy
Mat28:20
Teaching
them
to
observe
all
things
whatsoever
I
have
commanded
I
am
with
you
even
unto
the
end
of
th
e
Mark1:1
The
beginning
of
the
gospel
of
Jesus
the
Son
of
Mark1:2
As
it
is
written
in
the
I
send
my
messenger
before
thy
which
shall
prepare
thy
way
before
Mark1:3
The
voice
of
one
crying
in
the
Prepare

paths
Mark1:4
John
did
baptize
in
the
and
preach
the
baptism
of
repentance
for
the
remission
of
Mark1:5
And
there
went
out
unto
him
all
the
land
of
and
they
of
and
were
all
baptized
of
him
in
the
river
of
Jor
confessing
their
Mark1:6
And
John
was
clothed
with
camel's
and
with
a
girdle
of
a
skin
about
his
and
he
did
eat
locusts
and
wild
Mark1:7
And
There
cometh
one
mightier
than
I
after
the
latchet
of
whose
shoes
I
am
not
worthy
to
stoop
down
a
nd
Mark1:8
I
indeed
have
baptized
you
with
but
he
shall
baptize
you
with
the
Holy
Mark1:9
And
it
came
to
pass
in
those
that
Jesus
came
from
Nazareth
of
and
was
baptized
of
John
in
Mark1:10
And
straightway
coming
up
out
of
the
he
saw
the
heavens
and
the
Spirit
like
a
dove
descending
upon
Mark1:11
And
there
came
a
voice
from
Thou
art
my
beloved
in
whom
I
am
well
Mark1:12
And
immediately
the
Spirit
driveth
him
into
the
Mark1:13
And
he
was
there
in
the
wilderness
forty
tempted
of
and
was
with
the
wild
and
the
angels
ministered
u
nto
Mark1:14
Now
after
that
John
was
put
in
Jesus
came
into
preaching
the
gospel
of
the
kingdom
of
Mark1:15
And
The
time
is
and
the
kingdom
of
God
is
at
repent
and
believe
the
Mark1:16
Now
as
he
walked
by
the
sea
of
he
saw
Simon
and
Andrew
his
brother
casting
a
net
into
the
for
they
were
fish
ers.
Mark1:17
And
Jesus
said
unto
Come
ye
after
and
I
will
make
you
to
become
fishers
of
Mark1:18
And
straightway
they
forsook
their
and
followed
Mark1:19
And
when
he
had
gone
a
little
farther
he
saw
James
the
son
of
and
John
his
who
also
were
in
the
ship
mending
their
Mark1:20
And
straightway
he
called
and
they
left
their
father
Zebedee
in
the
ship
with
the
hired
and
went
after
him
.
Mark1:21
And
they
went
into
and
straightway
on
the
sabbath
day
he
entered
into
the
and
Mark1:22
And
they
were
astonished
at
his
for
he
taught
them
as
one
that
had
and
not
as
the
Mark1:23
And
there
was
in
their
synagogue
a
man
with
an
unclean
and
he
cried
Mark1:24
Let
us
what
have
we
to
do
with
thou
Jesus
of
art
thou
come
to
destroy
I
know
thee
who
t
hou
the
Holy
One
of
Mark1:25
And
Jesus
rebuked
Hold
thy
and
come
out
of
Mark1:26
And
when
the
unclean
spirit
had
torn
and
cried
with
a
loud
he
came
out
of
Mark1:27
And
they
were
all
insomuch
that
they
questioned
among
What
thing
is
what
new
doctrine
is
for
with
authority
commandeth
he
even
the
unclean
and
they
do
obey
Mark1:28
And
immediately
his
fame
spread
abroad
throughout
all
the
region
round
about
Mark1:29
And
when
they
were
come
out
of
the
they
entered
into
the
house
of
Simon
and
with
James
and
J
ohn.
Mark1:30
But
Simon's
wife's
mother
lay
sick
of
a
and
anon
they
tell
him
of
Mark1:31
And
he
came
and
took
her
by
the
and
lifted
her
and
immediately
the
fever
left
and
she
ministered
unto
Mark1:32
And
at
when
the
sun
did
they
brought
unto
him
all
that
were
and
them
that
were
possessed
with
Mark1:33
And
all
the
city
was
gathered
together
at
the
Mark1:34
And
he
healed
many
that
were
sick
of
divers
and
cast
out
many
and
suffered
not
the
devils
to
beca
use
they
knew
Mark1:35
And
in
the
rising
up
a
great
while
before
he
went
and
departed
into
a
solitary
and
there
Mark1:36
And
Simon
and
they
that
were
with
him
followed
after
Mark1:37
And
when
they
had
found
they
said
unto
All
men
seek
for
Mark1:38
And
he
said
unto
Let
us
go
into
the
next
that
I
may
preach
there
for
therefore
came
I
Mark1:39
And
he
preached
in
their
synagogues
throughout
all
and
cast
out
Mark1:40
And
there
came
a
leper
to
beseeching
and
kneeling
down
to
and
saying
unto
If
thou
thou
canst
mak
e
me
Mark1:41
And
moved
with
put
forth
his
and
touched
and
saith
unto
I
be
thou
Mark1:42
And
as
soon
as
he
had
immediately
the
leprosy
departed
from
and
he
was
Mark1:43
And
he
straitly
charged
and
forthwith
sent
him
Mark1:44
And
saith
unto
See
thou
say
nothing
to
any
but
go
thy
shew
thyself
to
the
and
offer
for
thy
cleansi
ng
those
things
which
Moses
for
a
testimony
unto
Mark1:45
But
he
went
and
began
to
publish
it
and
to
blaze
abroad
the
insomuch
that
Jesus
could
no
more
openly
en
ter
into
the
but
was
without
in
desert
and
they
came
to
him
from
every
Mark2:1
And
again
he
entered
into
Capernaum
after
some
and
it
was
noised
that
he
was
in
the
Mark2:2
And
straightway
many
were
gathered
insomuch
that
there
was
no
room
to
receive
not
so
much
as
about
the
and
he
preached
the
word
unto
Mark2:3
And
they
come
unto
bringing
one
sick
of
the
which
was
borne
of
Mark2:4
And
when
they
could
not
come
nigh
unto
him
for
the
they
uncovered
the
roof
where
he
and
when
they
had
broken
it
they
let
down
the
bed
wherein
the
sick
of
the
palsy
Mark2:5
When
Jesus
saw
their
he
said
unto
the
sick
of
the
thy
sins
be
forgiven
Mark2:6
But
there
were
certain
of
the
scribes
sitting
and
reasoning
in
their
Mark2:7
Why
doth
this
man
thus
speak
who
can
forgive
sins
but
God
Mark2:8
And
immediately
when
Jesus
perceived
in
his
spirit
that
they
so
reasoned
within
he
said
unto
Why
reason
y
e
these
things
in
your
Mark2:9
Whether
is
it
easier
to
say
to
the
sick
of
the
Thy
sins
be
forgiven
or
to
and
take
up
thy
and
Mark2:10
But
that
ye
may
know
that
the
Son
of
man
hath
power
on
earth
to
forgive
(he
saith
to
the
sick
of
the
palsy,)
Mark2:11
I
say
unto
and
take
up
thy
and
go
thy
way
into
thine
Mark2:12
And
immediately
he
took
up
the
and
went
forth
before
them
insomuch
that
they
were
all
and
glorifi
ed
We
never
saw
it
on
this
Mark2:13
And
he
went
forth
again
by
the
sea
and
all
the
multitude
resorted
unto
and
he
taught
Mark2:14
And
as
he
passed
he
saw
Levi
the
son
of
Alphaeus
sitting
at
the
receipt
of
and
said
unto
Follow
And
h
e
arose
and
followed
Mark2:15
And
it
came
to
as
Jesus
sat
at
meat
in
his
many
publicans
and
sinners
sat
also
together
with
Jesus
and
his
for
there
were
and
they
followed
Mark2:16
And
when
the
scribes
and
Pharisees
saw
him
eat
with
publicans
and
they
said
unto
his
How
is
it
that
he
eateth
and
drinketh
with
publicans
and
Mark2:17
When
Jesus
heard
he
saith
unto
They
that
are
whole
have
no
need
of
the
but
they
that
are
I
came
not
to
call
the
but
sinners
to
Mark2:18
And
the
disciples
of
John
and
of
the
Pharisees
used
to
and
they
come
and
say
unto
Why
do
the
disciples
of
John
and
of
the
Pharisees
but
thy
disciples
fast
Mark2:19
And
Jesus
said
unto
Can
the
children
of
the
bridechamber
while
the
bridegroom
is
with
as
long
as
they
ha
ve
the
bridegroom
with
they
cannot
Mark2:20
But
the
days
will
when
the
bridegroom
shall
be
taken
away
from
and
then
shall
they
fast
in
those
Mark2:21
No
man
also
seweth
a
piece
of
new
cloth
on
an
old
else
the
new
piece
that
filled
it
up
taketh
away
from

and
the
rent
is
made
Mark2:22
And
no
man
putteth
new
wine
into

else
the
new
wine
doth
burst
the
and
the
wine
is
and
the
b
ottles
will
be
but
new
wine
must
be
put
into

Mark2:23
And
it
came
to
that
he
went
through
the
corn
fields
on
the
sabbath
and
his
disciples
as
they
to
pl
uck
the
ears
of
Mark2:24
And
the
Pharisees
said
unto
why
do
they
on
the
sabbath
day
that
which
is
not
Mark2:25
And
he
said
unto
Have
ye
never
read
what
David
when
he
had
and
was
an
hungred,
and
they
that
were
wit
h
Mark2:26
How
he
went
into
the
house
of
God
in
the
days
of
Abiathar
the
high
and
did
eat
the
which
is
not
lawful
to
eat
but
for
the
and
gave
also
to
them
which
were
with
Mark2:27
And
he
said
unto
The
sabbath
was
made
for
and
not
man
for
the
Mark2:28
Therefore
the
Son
of
man
is
Lord
also
of
the
Mark3:1
And
he
entered
again
into
the
and
there
was
a
man
there
which
had
a
withered
Mark3:2
And
they
watched
whether
he
would
heal
him
on
the
sabbath
that
they
might
accuse
Mark3:3
And
he
saith
unto
the
man
which
had
the
withered
Stand
Mark3:4
And
he
saith
unto
Is
it
lawful
to
do
good
on
the
sabbath
or
to
do
to
save
or
to
But
they
held
their
Mark3:5
And
when
he
had
looked
round
about
on
them
with
being
grieved
for
the
hardness
of
their
he
saith
unto
the
ma
n,
Stretch
forth
thine
And
he
stretched
it
and
his
hand
was
restored
whole
as
the
Mark3:6
And
the
Pharisees
went
and
straightway
took
counsel
with
the
Herodians
against
how
they
might
destroy
Mark3:7
But
Jesus
withdrew
himself
with
his
disciples
to
the
and
a
great
multitude
from
Galilee
followed
and
from
Mark3:8
And
from
and
from
Idumaea,
and
from
beyond
and
they
about
Tyre
and
a
great
when
they
h
ad
heard
what
great
things
he
came
unto
Mark3:9
And
he
spake
to
his
that
a
small
ship
should
wait
on
him
because
of
the
lest
they
should
throng
Mark3:10
For
he
had
healed
insomuch
that
they
pressed
upon
him
for
to
touch
as
many
as
had
Mark3:11
And
unclean
when
they
saw
fell
down
before
and
Thou
art
the
Son
of
Mark3:12
And
he
straitly
charged
them
that
they
should
not
make
him
Mark3:13
And
he
goeth
up
into
a
and
calleth
unto
him
whom
he
and
they
came
unto
Mark3:14
And
he
ordained
that
they
should
be
with
and
that
he
might
send
them
forth
to
Mark3:15
And
to
have
power
to
heal
and
to
cast
out
Mark3:16
And
Simon
he
surnamed
Mark3:17
And
James
the
son
of
and
John
the
brother
of
and
he
surnamed
them
which
The
sons
of
thunder

Mark3:18
And
and
and
and
and
and
James
the
son
of
Alphaeus,
and
Thaddaeus,
and
Simon

And
Judas
which
also
betrayed
and
they
went
into
an

And
the
multitude
cometh
together
so
that
they
could
not
so
much
as
eat
Mark3:21
And
when
his
friends
heard
of
they
went
out
to
lay
hold
on
for
they
He
is
beside
Mark3:22
And
the
scribes
which
came
down
from
Jerusalem
He

sat

they
said
unto

he
answered

looked
round

For
whosoever

And
he
began
again
to
teach

there
was
gathered
unto
him
a
great

that
he
entered
into

sat
in

the
whole
multitude
was

And
he
taught
them
many
things

said
unto
them
in
his
Mark4:3
there
went
out
a
sower
to
Mark4:4
And
it
came
to
as
he
sowed,
some
fell
by
the
way
and
the
fowls
of
the
air
came
and
devoured
it
Mark4:5
And
some
fell
on
stony
where
it
had
not
much

immediately
it
sprang

it
had
no

yield

he
said
unto

And
when
he
was
they
that
were
about
him
with
the
twelve
asked
of
him
the

And
he
said
unto
Unto
you
it
is
given
to
know
the
mystery
of
the
kingdom
of

unto
them
that

all
these

That
seeing

their

should

by

taketh

And
these
are
they
which
are
sown
among

And
the
cares
of
this
and
the
deceitfulness
of

the
lusts
of
other
things

these
are
they

that

said
unto
Take

And
he
Whereunto
shall
we
liken

kingdom
of

with
what
comparison
shall
we
compare

It
is
like

of

And
with
many
such
parables
spake
he
the
word
unto
as
they
were
able
to
hear
Mark4:34
But
without
a
parable
spake
he
not

when
they
were
he
expounded
all
things
to

And
the

when

saith
unto

they
feared

said

And
they
came

had
his

no

But
when
he
saw
Jesus
afar

cried
with
a
loud

he
asked

he
besought
him
much
that

away
out

there
was
there
nigh
unto

also
concerning

began
to

what
they
had
and
what
they
had
Mark6:31
And
he
said
unto
Come
ye
yourselves
apart
into
a
desert
and
rest
a
for
there
were
many
coming
and
goin
g,
and
they
had
no
leisure
so
much
as
to
Mark6:32
And
they
departed
into
a
desert
place
by
ship
Mark6:33
And
the
people
saw
them
and
many
knew
and
ran
afoot
thither
out
of
all
and
outwent
and
came
together
unto
Mark6:34
And
when
he
came
saw
much
and
was
moved
with
compassion
toward
because
they
were
as
sheep
not
ha
ving
a
and
he
began
to
teach
them
many
Mark6:35
And
when
the
day
was
now
far
his
disciples
came
unto
and
This
is
a
desert
and
now
the
time
is
far
Mark6:36
Send
them
that
they
may
go
into
the
country
round
and
into
the
and
buy
themselves
for
they
h
ave
nothing
to
Mark6:37
He
answered
and
said
unto
Give
ye
them
to
And
they
say
unto
Shall
we
go
and
buy
two
hundred
pennyworth
of
and
give
them
to
Mark6:38
He
saith
unto
How
many
loaves
have
go
and
And
when
they
they
and
two
Mark6:39
And
he
commanded
them
to
make
all
sit
down
by
companies
upon
the
green
Mark6:40
And
they
sat
down
in
by
and
by
Mark6:41
And
when
he
had
taken
the
five
loaves
and
the
two
he
looked
up
to
and
and
brake
the
and
g
ave
them
to
his
disciples
to
set
before
and
the
two
fishes
divided
he
among
them
Mark6:42
And
they
did
all
and
were
Mark6:43
And
they
took
up
twelve
baskets
full
of
the
and
of
the
Mark6:44
And
they
that
did
eat
of
the
loaves
were
about
five
thousand
Mark6:45
And
straightway
he
constrained
his
disciples
to
get
into
the
and
to
go
to
the
other
side
before
unto
whil
e
he
sent
away
the
Mark6:46
And
when
he
had
sent
them
he
departed
into
a
mountain
to
Mark6:47
And
when
even
was
the
ship
was
in
the
midst
of
the
and
he
alone
on
the
Mark6:48
And
he
saw
them
toiling
in
for
the
wind
was
contrary
unto
and
about
the
fourth
watch
of
the
night
he
cometh
unto
walking
upon
the
and
would
have
passed
by
Mark6:49
But
when
they
saw
him
walking
upon
the
they
supposed
it
had
been
a
and
cried
Mark6:50
For
they
all
saw
and
were
And
immediately
he
talked
with
and
saith
unto
Be
of
good
it
is
be
not
Mark6:51
And
he
went
up
unto
them
into
the
and
the
wind
and
they
were
sore
amazed
in
themselves
beyond
and
w
ondered.
Mark6:52
For
they
considered
not
the
miracle
of
the
for
their
heart
was
Mark6:53
And
when
they
had
passed
they
came
into
the
land
of
Gennesaret,
and
drew
to
the
Mark6:54
And
when
they
were
come
out
of
the
straightway
they
knew
Mark6:55
And
ran
through
that
whole
region
round
and
began
to
carry
about
in
beds
those
that
were
where
they
heard
he
Mark6:56
And
whithersoever
he
into
or
or
they
laid
the
sick
in
the
and
besought
him
th
at
they
might
touch
if
it
were
but
the
border
of
his
and
as
many
as
touched
him
were
made
Mark7:1
Then
came
together
unto
him
the
Pharisees,
and
certain
of
the
which
came
from
Mark7:2
And
when
they
saw
some
of
his
disciples
eat
bread
with
that
is
to
with
unwashen,
they
found
Mark7:3
For
the
Pharisees,
and
all
the
except
they
wash
their
hands
eat
holding
the
tradition
of
the
Mark7:4
And
when
they
come
from
the
except
they
they
eat
And
many
other
things
there
which
they
have
receive
d
to
as
the
washing
of
and
brasen
and
of
Mark7:5
Then
the
Pharisees
and
scribes
asked
Why
walk
not
thy
disciples
according
to
the
tradition
of
the
but
eat
brea
d
with
unwashen
Mark7:6
He
answered
and
said
unto
Well
hath
Esaias
prophesied
of
you
as
it
is
This
people
honoureth
me
w
ith
their
but
their
heart
is
far
from
Mark7:7
Howbeit
in
vain
do
they
worship
teaching
for
doctrines
the
commandments
of
Mark7:8
For
laying
aside
the
commandment
of
ye
hold
the
tradition
of
as
the
washing
of
pots
and
and
many
other
such
like
things

Mark7:9
And
he
said
unto
Full
well
ye
reject
the
commandment
of
that
ye
may
keep

For
Moses
Honour

But

If

many
such
like
things

Mark7:14
And
when
he
had
called
all
the
people
unto
he
said
unto
Hearken
unto
me
every
one
of
and
Mark7:15
There
is
nothing
from

the
things
which

that

If
any
man
have
ears
to

And
when
he
was
entered
into
the
house
from
the
his
disciples
asked
him
concerning
the
Mark7:18
And
he
saith
unto
Are
ye
so
without
understanding
Do
ye
not
that
whatsoever
thing
from
without

Because
it
entereth
not
into

but
into

goeth
out
into

purging

And
he
That

For

heart

adulteries,
Mark7:22
an

All
these
evil
things
come
from

defile

Mark7:24
And
from
thence
he
and
went
into
the
borders
of
Tyre
and
and
entered
into
an

would
have
no
man

but
he
could
not

For
a
certain
whose
young
daughter
had
an
unclean
heard
of
and
came
and
fell
at
his

The
woman
was
a
a
Syrophenician
by
and
she
besought
him
that
he
would
cast
forth
the
devil
out
of
her
daugh
Mark7:27
But
Jesus
said
unto
Let
the
children
first
be
for
it
is
not
meet
to
take
the
children's
and
to
cast
it
unto
the
Mark7:28
And
she
answered
and
said
unto
yet

dogs
under
the
table

of
the
children's
Mark7:29
And
he
said
unto
For
this
saying
go

devil
is
gone
out
of

And
when
she
was
come
to
her
she
found
the
devil
gone
and
her
daughter
laid
upon
the
Mark7:31
And
departing
from
the
coasts
of
Tyre
and
he
came
unto
the
sea
of
through
the
midst
of
the
coasts

Mark7:32
And
they
bring
unto
him
one
that
was
and
had
an
impediment
in
his
and
they
beseech
him
to
put
his
hand
upon
Mark7:33
And
he
took
him
aside
from
the
and
put
his
fingers
into
his
and
he
and
touched
his

And
looking
up
to
he
and
saith
unto
Ephphatha,
that
Be
Mark7:35
And
straightway
his
ears
were
and
the
string
of
his
tongue
was
and
he
spake
Mark7:36
And
he
charged
them
that
they
should
tell
no
but
the
more
he
charged
so
much
the
more
a
great
deal
they
publish
ed
Mark7:37
And
were
beyond
measure
He
hath
done
all
things
he
maketh
both
the
deaf
to
and
the
dumb
to
Mark8:1
In
those
days
the
multitude
being
very
and
having
nothing
to
Jesus
called
his
disciples
unto
and
saith
unt
o
Mark8:2
I
have
compassion
on
the
because
they
have
now
been
with
me
three
and
have
nothing
to
Mark8:3
And
if
I
send
them
away
fasting
to
their
own
they
will
faint
by
the
for
divers
of
them
came
from
Mark8:4
And
his
disciples
answered
From
whence
can
a
man
satisfy
these
men
with
bread
here
in
the
Mark8:5
And
he
asked
How
many
loaves
have
And
they
Mark8:6
And
he
commanded
the
people
to
sit
down
on
the
and
he
took
the
seven
and
gave
and
and
gave
t
o
his
disciples
to
set
before
and
they
did
set
them
before
the
Mark8:7
And
they
had
a
few
small
and
he
and
commanded
to
set
them
also
before
Mark8:8
So
they
did
and
were
and
they
took
up
of
the
broken
meat
that
was
left
seven
Mark8:9
And
they
that
had
eaten
were
about
four
and
he
sent
them
Mark8:10
And
straightway
he
entered
into
a
ship
with
his
and
came
into
the
parts
of
Dalmanutha.
Mark8:11
And
the
Pharisees
came
and
began
to
question
with
seeking
of
him
a
sign
from
tempting
Mark8:12
And
he
sighed
deeply
in
his
and
Why
doth
this
generation
seek
after
a
verily
I
say
unto
There
sh
all
no
sign
be
given
unto
this
Mark8:13
And
he
left
and
entering
into
the
ship
again
departed
to
the
other
Mark8:14
Now
the
disciples
had
forgotten
to
take
neither
had
they
in
the
ship
with
them
more
than
one
Mark8:15
And
he
charged
Take
beware
of
the
leaven
of
the
Pharisees,
and
of
the
leaven
of
Mark8:16
And
they
reasoned
among
It
is
because
we
have
no
Mark8:17
And
when
Jesus
knew
he
saith
unto
Why
reason
because
ye
have
no

ye
not
neither
understa
have
ye
your
heart

ye
and
having
hear
ye
and
do
ye
not
Mark8:19
When
I
brake
the
five
loaves
among
five
how
many
baskets
full
of
fragments
took
ye
They
say
unto
Twelve
.
Mark8:20
And
when
the
seven
among
four
how
many
baskets
full
of
fragments
took
ye
And
they
Mark8:21
And
he
said
unto
How
is
it
that
ye
do
not
Mark8:22
And
he
cometh
to
and
they
bring
a
blind
man
unto
and
besought
him
to
touch
Mark8:23
And
he
took
the
blind
man
by
the
and
led
him
out
of
the
and
when
he
had
spit
on
his
and
put
his
hands
up
on
he
asked
him
if
he
saw
Mark8:24
And
he
looked
and
I
see
men
as
Mark8:25
After
that
he
put
his
hands
again
upon
his
and
made
him
look
and
he
was
and
saw
every
man
Mark8:26
And
he
sent
him
away
to
his
Neither
go
into

nor

it
to
any
in

Mark8:27
And
Jesus
went
and
his
into
the
towns
of
Caesarea
and
by
the
way
he
asked
his
saying
unto
Whom
do
men
say
that
I
Mark8:28
And
they
John
the
but
some
and
One
of
the
Mark8:29
And
he
saith
unto
But
whom
say
ye
that
I
And
Peter
answereth
and
saith
unto
Thou
art
the
Mark8:30
And
he
charged
them
that
they
should
tell
no
man
of
Mark8:31
And
he
began
to
teach
that
the
Son
of
man
must
suffer
many
and
be
rejected
of
the
and
of
the
chief
p
riests,
and
and
be
and
after
three
days
rise
Mark8:32
And
he
spake
that
saying
And
Peter
took
and
began
to
rebuke
Mark8:33
But
when
he
had
turned
about
and
looked
on
his
he
rebuked
Get
thee
behind
for
thou
sa
vourest
not
the
things
that
be
of
but
the
things
that
be
of
Mark8:34
And
when
he
had
called
the
people
unto
him
with
his
disciples
he
said
unto
Whosoever
will
come
after
let
h
im
deny
and
take
up
his
and
follow
Mark8:35
For
whosoever
will
save
his
life
shall
lose
but
whosoever
shall
lose
his
life
for
my
sake
and
the
gospel's,
the
same
s
hall
save
Mark8:36
For
what
shall
it
profit
a
if
he
shall
gain
the
whole
and
lose
his
own
Mark8:37
Or
what
shall
a
man
give
in
exchange
for
his
Mark8:38
Whosoever
therefore
shall
be
ashamed
of
me
and
of
my
words
in
this
adulterous
and
sinful
of
him
also
shall
the
Son
of
man
be
when
he
cometh
in
the
glory
of
his
Father
with
the
holy
Mark9:1
And
he
said
unto
Verily
I
say
unto
That
there
be
some
of
them
that
stand
which
shall
not
taste
of
t
ill
they
have
seen
the
kingdom
of
God
come
with
Mark9:2
And
after
six
days
Jesus
taketh
with
him
and
and
and
leadeth
them
up
into
an
high
mountain
apart
by
the
mselves:
and
he
was
transfigured
before
Mark9:3
And
his
raiment
became
exceeding
white
as
so
as
no
fuller
on
earth
can
white
Mark9:4
And
there
appeared
unto
them
Elias
with
and
they
were
talking
with
Mark9:5
And
Peter
answered
and
said
to
it
is
good
for
us
to
be
and
let
us
make
three
one
for
thee
,
and
one
for
and
one
for
Mark9:6
For
he
wist
not
what
to
for
they
were
sore
Mark9:7
And
there
was
a
cloud
that
overshadowed
and
a
voice
came
out
of
the
This
is
my
beloved
hear
Mark9:8
And
when
they
had
looked
round
they
saw
no
man
any
save
Jesus
only
with
Mark9:9
And
as
they
came
down
from
the
he
charged
them
that
they
should
tell
no
man
what
things
they
had
till
the
S
on
of
man
were
risen
from
the
Mark9:10
And
they
kept
that
saying
with
questioning
one
with
another
what
the
rising
from
the
dead
should
Mark9:11
And
they
asked
Why
say
the
scribes
that
Elias
must
first
Mark9:12
And
he
answered
and
told
Elias
verily
cometh
and
restoreth
all
and
how
it
is
written
of
the
Son
of
ma
n,
that
he
must
suffer
many
and
be
set
at
Mark9:13
But
I
say
unto
That
Elias
is
indeed
and
they
have
done
unto
him
whatsoever
they
as
it
is
written
of
him
.
Mark9:14
And
when
he
came
to
his
he
saw
a
great
multitude
about
and
the
scribes
questioning
with
Mark9:15
And
straightway
all
the
when
they
beheld
were
greatly
and
running
to
him
saluted
Mark9:16
And
he
asked
the
What
question
ye
with
Mark9:17
And
one
of
the
multitude
answered
and
I
have
brought
unto
thee
my
which
hath
a
dumb

And
wheresoever
he
taketh
he
teareth
and
he
foameth,
and
gnasheth
with
his
and
pineth
and
I
spake
t
o
thy
disciples
that
they
should
cast
him
and
they
could

He
answereth
and
O
faithless
how
long
shall
I
be
with
how
long
shall
I
suffer
bring
him
unto
Mark9:20
And
they
brought
him
unto
and
when
he
saw
straightway
the
spirit
tare
and
he
fell
on
the
and
wallow
ed
Mark9:21
And
he
asked
his
How
long
is
it
ago
since
this
came
unto
And
he
Of
a
Mark9:22
And
ofttimes
it
hath
cast
him
into
the
and
into
the
to
destroy
but
if
thou
canst
do
any
have
com
passion
on
and
help
Mark9:23
Jesus
said
unto
If
thou
canst
all
things
are
possible
to
him
that
believeth.
Mark9:24
And
straightway
the
father
of
the
child
cried
and
said
with
I
help
thou
mine
Mark9:25
When
Jesus
saw
that
the
people
came
running
he
rebuked
the
foul
saying
unto
Thou
dumb
and
deaf
spir
I
charge
come
out
of
and
enter
no
more
into
Mark9:26
And
the
spirit
and
rent
him
and
came
out
of
and
he

insomuch
that
many
He
is
Mark9:27
But
Jesus
took
him
by
the
and
lifted
him
and
he
Mark9:28
And
when
he
was
come
into
the
his
disciples
asked
him
Why
could
not
we
cast
him
Mark9:29
And
he
said
unto
This
kind
can
come
forth
by
but
by
prayer
and
Mark9:30
And
they
departed
and
passed
through
and
he
would
not
that
any
man
should
know
Mark9:31
For
he
taught
his
and
said
unto
The
Son
of
man
is
delivered
into
the
hands
of
and
they
shall
kill
hi
m;
and
after
that
he
is
he
shall
rise
the
third
Mark9:32
But
they
understood
not
that
and
were
afraid
to
ask
Mark9:33
And
he
came
to
and
being
in
the
house
he
asked
What
was
it
that
ye
disputed
among
yourselves
by
the
Mark9:34
But
they
held
their
for
by
the
way
they
had
disputed
among
who
should
be
the
Mark9:35
And
he
sat
and
called
the
and
saith
unto
If
any
man
desire
to
be
the
same
shall
be
last
of
and
servant
of
Mark9:36
And
he
took
a
and
set
him
in
the
midst
of
and
when
he
had
taken
him
in
his
he
said
unto
Mark9:37
Whosoever
shall
receive
one
of
such
children
in
my
receiveth
and
whosoever
shall
receive
receiveth
not
b
ut
him
that
sent
Mark9:38
And
John
answered
we
saw
one
casting
out
devils
in
thy
and
he
followeth
not
and
we
forbad
h
because
he
followeth
not
Mark9:39
But
Jesus
Forbid
him
for
there
is
no
man
which
shall
do
a
miracle
in
my
that
can
lightly
speak
evil
of
me

Mark9:40
For
he
that
is
not
against
us
is
on
our
Mark9:41
For
whosoever
shall
give
you
a
cup
of
water
to
drink
in
my
because
ye
belong
to
verily
I
say
unto
he
sh
all
not
lose
his
Mark9:42
And
whosoever
shall
offend
one
of
these
little
ones
that
believe
in
it
is
better
for
him
that
a
millstone
were
hanged
about
his
and
he
were
cast
into
the
Mark9:43
And
if
thy
hand
offend
cut
it
it
is
better
for
thee
to
enter
into
life
than
having
two
hands
to
go
into
into
the
fire
that
never

Where
their
worm
dieth
and

And
if
thy
foot
offend
cut

it
is
better
for
thee
to

Where

And
if
thine
eye

pluck
it
it
is
better
for
thee
to
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
God
with

Mark9:48
Where

For
every

shall
be
salted

Salt
is

if
the

Have

Mark10:1
And
he
arose
from
and
cometh
into
the
coasts
of
Judaea
by
the
farther
side
of
and
the
people
resort
unto
h
im
as
he
was
he
taught
them
Mark10:2
And
the
Pharisees
came
to
and
asked
Is
it
lawful
for
a
man
to
put
away
his
tempting
Mark10:3
And
he
answered
and
said
unto
What
did
Moses
command
Mark10:4
And
they
Moses
suffered
to
write
a
bill
of
and
to
put
her
Mark10:5
And
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
For
the
hardness
of
your
heart
he
wrote
you
this
Mark10:6
But
from
the
beginning
of
the
creation
God
made
them
male
and
Mark10:7
For
this
cause
shall
a
man
leave
his
father
and
and
cleave
to
his
Mark10:8
And
they
twain
shall
be
one
so
then
they
are
no
more
but
one
Mark10:9
What
therefore
God
hath
joined
let
not
man
put
Mark10:10
And
in
the
house
his
disciples
asked
him
again
of
the
same
Mark10:11
And
he
saith
unto
Whosoever
shall
put
away
his
and
marry
committeth
adultery
against
Mark10:12
And
if
a
woman
shall
put
away
her
and
be
married
to
she
committeth
Mark10:13
And
they
brought
young
children
to
that
he
should
touch
and
his
disciples
rebuked
those
that
brought
Mark10:14
But
when
Jesus
saw
he
was
much
and
said
unto
Suffer
the
little
children
to
come
unto
and
forbid
them
for
of
such
is
the
kingdom
of
Mark10:15
Verily
I
say
unto
Whosoever
shall
not
receive
the
kingdom
of
God
as
a
little
he
shall
not
enter
Mark10:16
And
he
took
them
up
in
his
put
his
hands
upon
and
blessed
Mark10:17
And
when
he
was
gone
forth
into
the
there
came
one
and
kneeled
to
and
asked
Good
what
sha
ll
I
do
that
I
may
inherit
eternal
Mark10:18
And
Jesus
said
unto
Why
callest
thou
me
there
is
none
good
but
that
Mark10:19
Thou
knowest
the
Do
not
commit
Do
not
Do
not
Do
not
bear
false
Defraud
Honour
thy
father
and
Mark10:20
And
he
answered
and
said
unto
all
these
have
I
observed
from
my
Mark10:21
Then
Jesus
beholding
him
loved
and
said
unto
One
thing
thou
lackest:
go
thy
sell
whatsoever
thou
and
give
to
the
and
thou
shalt
have
treasure
in
and
take
up
the
and
follow
Mark10:22
And
he
was
sad
at
that
and
went
away
for
he
had
great
Mark10:23
And
Jesus
looked
round
and
saith
unto
his
How
hardly
shall
they
that
have
riches
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
Mark10:24
And
the
disciples
were
astonished
at
his
But
Jesus
answereth
and
saith
unto
how
hard
is
it
for
them
that
trust
in
riches
to
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
Mark10:25
It
is
easier
for
a
camel
to
go
through
the
eye
of
a
than
for
a
rich
man
to
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
Mark10:26
And
they
were
astonished
out
of
saying
among
Who
then
can
be
Mark10:27
And
Jesus
looking
upon
them
With
men
it
is
but
not
with
for
with
God
all
things
are
Mark10:28
Then
Peter
began
to
say
unto
we
have
left
and
have
followed
Mark10:29
And
Jesus
answered
and
Verily
I
say
unto
There
is
no
man
that
hath
left
or
or
or
fat
or
or
or
or
for
my
and
the
gospel's,
Mark10:30
But
he
shall
receive
an
hundredfold
now
in
this
and
and
and
and
and
l
with
persecutions;
and
in
the
world
to
come
eternal
Mark10:31
But
many
that
are
first
shall
be
and
the
last
Mark10:32
And
they
were
in
the
way
going
up
to
and
Jesus
went
before
and
they
were
and
as
they
t
hey
were
And
he
took
again
the
and
began
to
tell
them
what
things
should
happen
unto
Mark10:33
we
go
up
to
and
the
Son
of
man
shall
be
delivered
unto
the
chief
and
unto
the
scribes
;
and
they
shall
condemn
him
to
and
shall
deliver
him
to
the
Mark10:34
And
they
shall
mock
and
shall
scourge
and
shall
spit
upon
and
shall
kill
and
the
third
day
he
shall
r
ise
Mark10:35
And
James
and
the
sons
of
come
unto
we
would
that
thou
shouldest
do
for
us
whatsoever
we
shall
Mark10:36
And
he
said
unto
What
would
ye
that
I
should
do
for
Mark10:37
They
said
unto
Grant
unto
us
that
we
may
one
on
thy
right
and
the
other
on
thy
left
in
thy
Mark10:38
But
Jesus
said
unto
Ye
know
not
what
ye
can
ye
drink
of
the
cup
that
I
drink
and
be
baptized
with
the
bapt
ism
that
I
am
baptized
Mark10:39
And
they
said
unto
We
And
Jesus
said
unto
Ye
shall
indeed
drink
of
the
cup
that
I
drink
and
with
the
baptism
that
I
am
baptized
withal
shall
ye
be
Mark10:40
But
to
sit
on
my
right
hand
and
on
my
left
hand
is
not
mine
to
but
it
shall
be
given
to
them
for
whom
it
is
prepare
d.
Mark10:41
And
when
the
ten
heard
they
began
to
be
much
displeased
with
James
and
Mark10:42
But
Jesus
called
them
to
and
saith
unto
Ye
know
that
they
which
are
accounted
to
rule
over
the
Gentiles
exerci
se
lordship
over
and
their
great
ones
exercise
authority
upon
Mark10:43
But
so
shall
it
not
be
among
but
whosoever
will
be
great
among
shall
be
your
Mark10:44
And
whosoever
of
you
will
be
the
chiefest,
shall
be
servant
of
Mark10:45
For
even
the
Son
of
man
came
not
to
be
ministered
but
to
and
to
give
his
life
a
ransom
for
Mark10:46
And
they
came
to
and
as
he
went
out
of
Jericho
with
his
disciples
and
a
great
number
of
blind
Bartimaeus
,
the
son
of
Timaeus,
sat
by
the
highway
side
Mark10:47
And
when
he
heard
that
it
was
Jesus
of
he
began
to
cry
and
thou
son
of
have
mercy
on
me
.
Mark10:48
And
many
charged
him
that
he
should
hold
his
but
he
cried
the
more
a
great
Thou
son
of
have
mercy
on
Mark10:49
And
Jesus
stood
and
commanded
him
to
be
And
they
call
the
blind
saying
unto
Be
of
good
he
calleth
Mark10:50
And
casting
away
his
and
came
to
Mark10:51
And
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
What
wilt
thou
that
I
should
do
unto
The
blind
man
said
unto
that
I
might
receive
my
Mark10:52
And
Jesus
said
unto
Go
thy
thy
faith
hath
made
thee
And
immediately
he
received
his
and
followed
Jesus
in
the
Mark11:1
And
when
they
came
nigh
to
unto
Bethphage
and
at
the
mount
of
he
sendeth
forth
two
of
his
disc

Mark11:2
And
saith
unto
Go
your
way
into
the
village
over

as
soon
as
ye
be
entered
into

shall
find
a
colt
whereon
never

bring

And
if
any
man
say
unto
Why
do
ye
say
ye
that
the
Lord
hath
need
of
and
straightway
he
will
send
him

Mark11:4
And
they
went
their
and
found
the
colt
tied
by
the
door
without
in
a
place
where
two
ways
and
they
loose

And
certain
of
them
that
stood
there
said
unto
What
do
loosing
the
Mark11:6
And
they
said
unto
them
even
as
Jesus
had
and
they
let
them
Mark11:7
And
they
brought
the
colt
to
and
cast
their
garments
on
and
he
sat
upon
Mark11:8
And
many
spread
their
garments
in
the
and
others
cut
down
branches
off
the
and
strawed
them
in
the
Mark11:9
And
they
that
went
and
they
that

Blessed
be
the
kingdom
of
our
father
that
cometh
in

name
of

Hosanna
in

Mark11:11
And
Jesus
entered
into
and
into
the
and
when
he
had
looked
round
about
upon
all
and
now
the
ev
entide
was
he
went
out
unto
Bethany
with
the
Mark11:12
And
on
the
when
they
were
come
from
he
was
Mark11:13
And
seeing
a
fig
tree
afar
off
having
he
if
haply
he
might
find
any
thing
and
when
he
came
to
he
found
nothing
but
for
the
time
of
figs
was
not
Mark11:14
And
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
No
man
eat
fruit
of
thee
hereafter
for
And
his
disciples
heard
Mark11:15
And
they
come
to
and
Jesus
went
into
the
and
began
to
cast
out
them
that
sold
and
bought
in
the
temple
,
and
overthrew
the
tables
of
the
moneychangers,
and
the
seats
of
them
that
sold
Mark11:16
And
would
not
suffer
that
any
man
should
carry
any
vessel
through
the
Mark11:17
And
he
saying
unto
Is
it
not
My
house
shall
be
called
of
all
nations
the
house
of
but
ye
h
ave
made
it
a
den
of
Mark11:18
And
the
scribes
and
chief
priests
heard
and
sought
how
they
might
destroy
for
they
feared
because
all
the
p
eople
was
astonished
at
his
Mark11:19
And
when
even
was
he
went
out
of
the
Mark11:20
And
in
the
as
they
passed
they
saw
the
fig
tree
dried
up
from
the
Mark11:21
And
Peter
calling
to
remembrance
saith
unto
the
fig
tree
which
thou
cursedst
is
withered
Mark11:22
And
Jesus
answering
saith
unto
Have
faith
in
Mark11:23
For
verily
I
say
unto
That
whosoever
shall
say
unto
this
Be

shall
believe
that
those
things

he
saith
shall

say
unto
What

they
come
again
to

as
he
was
walking
in

come
to
him
the
chief
and
the
scrib

And
say
unto
By
what
authority
doest

who
gave
thee
this
authority
to

And
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
I
will
also
ask
of
you

he
began
to

A
certain

at
the

they
caught

at
him
they
cast

was

it
is
marvellous
in
our

And
they
sought
to
lay

feared

knew
that

had
spoken

answering
said
unto
Render

they
marvelled
at

Then
come
unto
him

Sadducees,

say
there

they
asked

Moses
wrote

For

God
spake

And
one
of

scribes
and
having
heard
them
reasoning
and
perceiving
that
he
had
answered
them
ask

Which
is
the
first
commandment
of

And
Jesus
answered
The
first
of
all
the
commandments
O
The

Mark12:30
And
thou

this
is
the
first
Mark12:31
And
the
second
is
namely
Thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbour
as
There
is
none
other
commandment
greater
th
an
Mark12:32
And
the
scribe
said
unto
thou
hast
said
the

there
is
one
and
there
is
none
other
but

Mark12:33
And
to
love
him
with
all
the
and
with
all
the
and
with
all
the
and
with
all
the
and
to
love
his
neighbour
as
is
more
than
all

offerings
and

And
when
Jesus
saw
that
he
answered
he
said
unto
Thou
art
not
far
from

kingdom
of
And
no
man

answered

How
say

For
David

David
therefore
himself
calleth

And
the
common
people
heard
him

And
he
said
unto
them
in
his
Beware
of

and
love
salutations
in

uppermost
rooms
at

Which

And
Jesus
sat
over
against

beheld
how
the
people
cast
money

I
say
unto
That
this
poor
widow
hath
cast
more

For
all
they
did
cast

And
as
he
went
out
of

one
of
his
disciples
saith
unto

what
manner
of

what
building

And
Jesus
answering
said
unto
Seest
thou
these

not

And
as
he
sat
upon

mount
of
Olives
over
against

Peter

James

John
and
Andrew
asked
him
Mark13:4
Tell
when

what

the
sign
when
all
these
things

And
Jesus
answering
them
began
to
Take
heed
lest
any
man
deceive
Mark13:6
For
many
shall
come
in
my

For

there
shall
be
earthquakes
in
divers
and
th
ere
shall
be
famines
and
these
are
the
beginnings
of
Mark13:9
But
take
heed
to
for
they
shall
deliver
you
up
to

in
the
synagogues
ye
shall
be
and
ye

hall
be
brought
before
rulers
and
kings
for
my
for
a
testimony
against
Mark13:10
And
the
gospel
must
first
be
published
among
all
Mark13:11
But
when
they
shall
lead
and
deliver
you
take
no
thought
beforehand
what
ye

Daniel

then
let

And
let

not

woe

And
pray
ye
that

And
the
chief
priests
and
all
the
council
sought
for
witness
against

to
put

found
Mark14:56
For
many
bare
false

their
witness
agreed
not
Mark14:57
And
there
arose
and
bare
false

against
Mark14:58
We
heard

will
destroy
this

days
I
will

But
neither
so
did
their
witness
agree
Mark14:60
And
the
high
priest
stood
up
in
the
and
asked
Answerest
thou
what
is
it
which

witnes

But
he
held
his
and
answered
Again
the
high
priest
asked
and
said
unto
Art

Son
of

Mark14:62
And
Jesus
I
and
ye
shall

the
Son
of

of

coming
in
the
clouds
of

Mark14:63
Then
the
high
priest
rent
his
and
What
need
we
any
further
Mark14:64
Ye
have
heard
the
what
think
And
they
all
condemned
him
to
be
guilty
of
Mark14:65
And
some
began
to
spit
on
and
to
cover
his
and
to
buffet
and
to
say

and
the
servants
did
strike
him
with
the
palms
of
their

And
as
Peter
was
beneath
in

cometh
one
of
the
maids
of
the
high

And
when
she
saw
Peter
warming
she
looked
upon

And
thou
also
wast
with
Jesus
of
Mark14:68
But
he
I
know
neither

I
what
thou
sayest.
And
he
went
out
into

Mark14:69
And
a
maid
saw
him
and
began
to
say
to
them
that
stood
This
is
one
of
Mark14:70
And
he
denied
it
And
a
little
they
that
stood
by
said
again
to
Surely
thou
art
one
of
for
thou
art
a
Galilaean,
and
thy
speech
agreeth
Mark14:71
But
he
began
to
curse
and
to
I

not
this
man
of
whom

And
the
second
time

And
Peter
called
to
mind
the
word
that
Jesus
said
unto
Before

And
when

And
straightway
in
the
morning
the
chief
priests
held
a
consultation
with
the
elders
and
scribes
and
the
whole
an

carried
him
and
delivered
him
to

And
Pilate
asked
Art

the
King
of

And
he
answering
said
unto
Thou
sayest
Mark15:3
And
the
chief
priests
accused
him
of
many
but
he
answered
Mark15:4
And
Pilate
asked
him
Answerest
thou
behold
how
many
things
they
witness
against
Mark15:5
But
Jesus
yet
answered
so
that
Pilate

Now
at
that
feast
he
released
unto
them
one
whomsoever
they

And
there
was
one
named
which
lay
bound
with
them
that
had
made
insurrection
with
who
had
committed
murder
in
the
Mark15:8
And
the
multitude
crying
aloud
began
to
desire
him
to
do
as
he
had
ever
done
unto
Mark15:9
But
Pilate
answered
Will
ye
that
I
release
unto
you
the
King
of
the
Mark15:10
For
he
knew
that
the
chief
priests
had
delivered
him
for
Mark15:11
But
the
chief
priests
moved
the
that
he
should
rather
release
Barabbas
unto
Mark15:12
And
Pilate
answered
and
said
again
unto
What
will
ye
then
that
I
shall
do
unto
him
whom
ye
call
the
King
of
the
Jew

Mark15:13
And
they
cried
out
Crucify
Mark15:14
Then
Pilate
said
unto
what
evil
hath
he
And
they
cried
out
the
more
Crucify

And
so
willing
to
content
the
released
Barabbas
unto

delivered
when
he
had
scourged

And
the
soldiers
led
him
away
into
the
called
Praetorium;
and
they
call
together

whole

And
they
clothed
him
with

platted
a
crown
of

put
it
about

And
began
to
salute
King

And
they
smote
him
on
the
head
with

did
spit
upon

bowing
their
knees
worshipped
Mark15:20
And
when
they
had
mocked
they
took
off
the
purple
from

put

clothes
on

led
him
out
to

And
it
was

And
the
superscription
of

was
written

And
Jesus
cried
with
a

and
gave
up

And
the
veil
of
the
temple
was
rent
in

from

And
when

and
many
other
women
which
came
up
with
him
un

And
now
when

before

Joseph
of
Arimathaea,
an

also
waited
for

kingdom
of

went
in
boldly
unto
P

and
craved

body
of

And
Pilate
marvelled
if
he
were
already
and
calling
unto
him
the
he
asked
him
whether
he
had
been
any
wh

when
he
knew
it

to

And
he
bought
fine

took
him
and
wrapped
him
in

laid
him
in
a
sepulchre
which
was
hewn
out
of

rolled

when

had
bought

And
very
early
in
the
morning
the
first
day
of
the
they
came
unto
the
sepulchre
at
the
rising
of
the
Mark16:3
And
they
said
among
Who
shall
roll

away

stone
from

door
of

Mark16:4
And
when
they
they
saw
that
the
stone
was
rolled
for
it
was
very
Mark16:5
And
entering
into
the
they
saw
a
young
man
sitting
on
the
right
clothed
in
a
long
white
and
they
were
affrighted.
Mark16:6
And
he
saith
unto
Be
not
affrighted:

But
go

his
disciples
and
Peter
that
he
goeth
before
you
into
there
shall
ye
see
as
he
said
un
to
Mark16:8
And
they
went
out
and
fled
from
the
for
they
trembled
and
were
neither
said
they
any
thing
to
any
for
they
were

Now
when
Jesus
was
risen
early
the
first
day
of
the
he
appeared
first
to
Mary
out
of
whom
he
had
cast
sev
en
Mark16:10
And
she
went
and
told
them
that
had
been
with
as
they
mourned
and
Mark16:11
And
when
they
had
heard
that
he
was
and
had
been
seen
of

After
that
he
appeared
in
another
form
unto
two
of
as
they
and
went
into
the
Mark16:13
And
they
went
and
told
it
unto
the
neither
believed
they
Mark16:14
Afterward
he
appeared
unto
the
eleven
as
they
sat
at
and
upbraided
them
with
their
unbelief
and
hardness
of
because
they
believed
not
them
which
had
seen
him
after
he
was
Mark16:15
And
he
said
unto
Go

into
all

gospel
to
every

signs
shall
follow

that

So
then
after
the
Lord
had
spoken
unto
he
was
received
up
into
and
sat
on
the
right
hand
of
Mark16:20
And
they
went
and
preached
every

with
and
confirming

word
with
signs

Forasmuch
as
many
have
taken
in
hand
to
set
forth
in
order
a
declaration
of
those
things
which
are
most
surely
believed
amo

Luke1:2
Even
as
they
delivered
them
unto
which
from
the
beginning
were
and
ministers
of
the
Luke1:3
It
seemed
good
to
me
having
had
perfect
understanding
of
all
things
from
the
very
to
write
unto
thee
in
most
excellent
Luke1:4
That
thou
mightest
know
the
certainty
of
those
wherein
thou
hast
been

There
was
in
the
days
of
the
king
of
a
certain
priest
named
of
the
course
of
Abia:
and
his
wife
w
as
of
the
daughters
of

her
name
was
Luke1:6
And
they
were
both
righteous
before
walking
in
all
the
commandments
and
ordinances
of
the
Lord
Luke1:7
And
they
had
no
because
that
Elisabeth
was
and
they
both
were
now
well
stricken
in
Luke1:8
And
it
came
to
that
while
he
executed
the
priest's
office
before
God
in
the
order
of
his
Luke1:9
According
to
the
custom
of
the
priest's
his
lot
was
to
burn
incense
when
he
went
into
the
temple
of
the
Luke1:10
And
the
whole
multitude
of
the
people
were
praying
without
at
the
time
of
Luke1:11
And
there
appeared
unto
him
an
angel
of
the
Lord
standing
on
the
right
side
of
the
altar
of
Luke1:12
And
when
Zacharias
saw
he
was
and
fear
fell
upon
Luke1:13
But
the
angel
said
unto
Fear
for
thy
prayer
is
and
thy
wife
Elisabeth
shall
bear
thee
a

thou
shalt
call
his
name
Luke1:14
And
thou
shalt
have
joy
and
and
many
shall
rejoice
at
his
Luke1:15
For
he
shall
be
great
in
the
sight
of
the
and
shall
drink
neither
wine
nor
strong
and
he
shall
be
filled
with
the
Holy
even
from
his
mother's
Luke1:16
And
many
of
the
children
of
Israel
shall
he
turn
to
the
Lord
their
Luke1:17
And
he
shall
go
before
him
in
the
spirit
and
power
of
to
turn
the
hearts
of
the
fathers
to
the
and
the
di
sobedient
to
the
wisdom
of
the
to
make
ready
a
people
prepared
for

Luke1:18
And
Zacharias
said
unto
the
Whereby
shall
I
know
for
I
am
an
old
and
my
wife
well
stricken
in
Luke1:19
And
the
angel
answering
said
unto
I
am
that
stand
in
the
presence
of

am
sent
to
speak
unto
an
d

shew
thee

not
able

the
day
that

things
shall
be
because
thou
b
elievest
not
my
which
shall
be
fulfilled
in
their
Luke1:21
And
the
people
waited
for
and
marvelled
that
he
tarried
so
long
in
the
Luke1:22
And
when
he
came
he
could
not
speak
unto
and
they
perceived
that
he
had
seen
a
vision
in
the
for
he
bec

unto
and
remained

And
it
came
to
as
soon
as
the
days
of
his
ministration
were

departed
to

own

And
after
those
days

wife
Elisabeth

hid
herself

Thus
hath
the
Lord
dealt
with
me
in
the
days
wherein
he
looked
on
to
take
away

reproach
among

And
in
the
sixth
month
the
angel
Gabriel
was
sent
from
God
unto
a
city
of
named
Luke1:27
To
a
virgin
espoused
to
a
man
whose
name
was
of
the
house
of
and
the
virgin's
name
was

the
angel
came
in
unto

And
when
she
saw
she
was
troubled
at
his
and
cast
in
her
mind
what
manner
of
salutation
this
should

And
the
angel
said
unto
Fear
for
thou
hast
found
favour
with

shalt
conceive

bring
forth

shalt
call
his
name

shall
be

shall
be
called

shall
give
unto
him

throne
of

Then
said
Mary
unto

answered
and
said
unto

also
conceived

is

the

departed
from

And
Mary
arose
in
those
and
went
into
the
hill
country
with
into
a
city
of
Juda;
Luke1:40
And
entered
into
the
house
of
and
saluted
Luke1:41
And
it
came
to
when
Elisabeth
heard
the
salutation
of

babe
leaped
in
her
and
Elisabeth
was

she
spake
out
with
a
loud
and

And
blessed

she
that

performance
of
those
things
which
were
told

Luke1:46
And
Mary
My
soul
doth
magnify
the
Luke1:47
And
my
spirit
hath
rejoiced
in
God
my
Luke1:48
For
he
hath
regarded
the
low
estate
of
his

henceforth
all
generations

call
me
Luke1:49
For
he
that
is
mighty

done
to
me
great
and
holy

his
Luke1:50
And
his
mercy
is
on
them
that

hath
shewed

hath
scattered
the

the
imagination
of
their
Luke1:52
He
hath
put
down
the
mighty
from
their

exalted
them
of
low
Luke1:53
He
hath
filled
the
hungry
with
good

the
rich

hath
sent

hath
holpen
his
servant
in

of

about

Now
Elisabeth's
full
time
came
that
she
should

she
brought
forth
a

her
neighbours
and
her
cousins
heard
how
the
Lord
had
shewed
great

they
rejoiced
with

And
it
came
to

on
the
eighth

came
to

his
Luke1:60
And
his
mother
answered
and
Not

he
shall
be
called
Luke1:61
And
they
said
unto
There
is
none
of
thy
kindred
that
is
called
by
this
Luke1:62
And
they
made
signs
to
his
how
he
would
have
him
Luke1:63
And
he
asked
for
a
writing
and
His
name
is

they
marvelled
Luke1:64
And
his
mouth
was
opened
and
his
tongue
and
he
and
praised
Luke1:65
And
fear
came
on
all
that
dwelt
round
about

all
these
sayings
were
noised
abroad
throughout
all
the
hill
country
of
Luke1:66
And
all
they
that
heard
them
laid
them
up
in

raised
up
an
horn
of
salvation
for

in
the
house
of
his
servant
Luke1:70
As
he
spake
by
the
mouth
of
his

have
been

Luke1:71
That
we
should
be
saved
from

To
perform
the

promised
to
our

oath
which
he
sware

our
father
Luke1:74
That

it
came
to

there
went

from

Joseph
also
went
up
from

of

came
upon

the

they
were

And
all
they
that
heard

wondered
at
those

But
Mary

said
unto
Mary

And
when

found
him
they
turned
back
again
to
seeking

it
came
to
that
after
three
days
they
found
him
in

asking
them

And
all
that
heard
him
were
astonished
at

And
when
they
saw
they
were
and
his
mother
said
unto
why
hast
thou
thus
dealt
with
thy
father
and
I
have
sought
thee
sorrowing.
Luke2:49
And
he
said
unto
How
is
it
that
ye
sought

ye
not
that
I
must
be
about
my

he
spake
unto

he
went
down
with

came
to

was
subject
unto

in
her

to

he
said
unto

no
more

demanded

Luke6:47
Whosoever
cometh
to
and
heareth
my
and
doeth
I
will
shew
you
to
whom
he
is
Luke6:48
He
is
like
a
man
which
built

digged
and
laid
the
foundation
on
a

when
the
flood
the
s
tream
beat
vehemently

could
not

for
it
was
founded
upon
a
Luke6:49
But
he
that
heareth,
and
doeth

like
a
man
that
without

built

Now
when
he
had
ended
all
his
sayings
in
the
audience
of
the
he
entered
into
Luke7:2
And
a
certain
centurion's
who
was
dear
unto
was
and
ready
to
Luke7:3
And
when
he
heard
of
he
sent
unto
him
the
elders
of
the
beseeching
him
that
he
would
come
and
heal
his
servant
.
Luke7:4
And
when
they
came
to
they
besought
him
That
he
was
worthy
for
whom
he
should
do
Luke7:5
For
he
loveth
our
and
he
hath
built
us

Then
Jesus
went
with
And
when
he
was
now
not
far
from
the
the
centurion
sent
friends
to
saying
unto
trouble
not
for
I
am
not
worthy
that
thou
shouldest
enter
under
my

Wherefore
neither
thought
I
myself
worthy
to
come
unto

say
in

my
servant
shall
be

I

When
Jesus
heard
these
he
marvelled
at
and
turned
him
and
said
unto
the
people
that
followed
I
say
unto
I
have
not
found
so
great
not
in
Luke7:10
And
they
that
were
returning
to
the
found
the
servant
whole
that
had
been
Luke7:11
And
it
came
to
pass
the
day
that
he
went
into
a
city
called
Nain;
and
many
of
his
disciples
went
with
and
much
Luke7:12
Now
when
he
came
nigh
to
the
gate
of
the
there
was
a
dead
man
carried
the
only
son
of
his
and
s
he
was
a
and
much
people
of
the
city
was
with
Luke7:13
And
when
the
Lord
saw
he
had
compassion
on
and
said
unto
Weep
Luke7:14
And
he
came
and
touched
the
and
they
that
bare
him
stood
And
he
Young
I
say
unto
Luke7:15
And
he
that
was
dead
sat
and
began
to
And
he
delivered
him
to
his
Luke7:16
And
there
came
a
fear
on
and
they
glorified
That
a
great
prophet
is
risen
up
among
That
God
hat
h
visited
his
Luke7:17
And
this
rumour
of
him
went
forth
throughout
all
and
throughout
all
the
region
round
Luke7:18
And
the
disciples
of
John
shewed
him
of
all
these
Luke7:19
And
John
calling
unto
him
two
of
his
disciples
sent
them
to
Art
thou
he
that
should
or
look
we
for
an
Luke7:20
When
the
men
were
come
unto
they
John
Baptist
hath
sent
us
unto
Art
thou
he
that
should
or
look
we
for
Luke7:21
And
in
that
same
hour
he
cured
many
of
their
infirmities
and
and
of
evil
and
unto
many
that
were
blind
h
e
gave
Luke7:22
Then
Jesus
answering
said
unto
Go
your
and
tell
John
what
things
ye
have
seen
and
how
that
the
blind
see
,
the
lame
the
lepers
are
the
deaf
the
dead
are
to
the
poor
the
gospel
is
Luke7:23
And
blessed
is
whosoever
shall
not
be
offended
in
Luke7:24
And
when
the
messengers
of
John
were
he
began
to
speak
unto
the
people
concerning
What
went
ye
out
into
th
e
wilderness
for
to
A
reed
shaken
with
the
Luke7:25
But
what
went
ye
out
for
to
A
man
clothed
in
soft
they
which
are
gorgeously
and
live
del
icately,
are
in
Luke7:26
But
what
went
ye
out
for
to
A
I
say
unto
and
much
more
than
a
Luke7:27
This
is
of
whom
it
is
I
send
my
messenger
before
thy
which
shall
prepare
thy
way
before
Luke7:28
For
I
say
unto
Among
those
that
are
born
of
women
there
is
not
a
greater
prophet
than
John
the
but
he
that
i
s
least
in
the
kingdom
of
God
is
greater
than
Luke7:29
And
all
the
people
that
heard
and
the
justified
being
baptized
with
the
baptism
of
Luke7:30
But
the
Pharisees
and
lawyers
rejected
the
counsel
of
God
against
being
not
baptized
of
Luke7:31
And
the
Lord
Whereunto
then
shall
I
liken
the
men
of
this
and
to
what
are
they
Luke7:32
They
are
like
unto
children
sitting
in
the
and
calling
one
to
and
We
have
piped
unto
an
d
ye
have
not
we
have
mourned
to
and
ye
have
not
Luke7:33
For
John
the
Baptist
came
neither
eating
bread
nor
drinking
and
ye
He
hath
a
Luke7:34
The
Son
of
man
is
come
eating
and
and
ye
Behold
a
gluttonous
and
a
a
friend
of
publicans
a
nd
Luke7:35
But
wisdom
is
justified
of
all
her
Luke7:36
And
one
of
the
Pharisees
desired
him
that
he
would
eat
with
And
he
went
into
the
Pharisee's
and
sat
down
to
me
Luke7:37
a
woman
in
the
which
was
a
when
she
knew
that
Jesus
sat
at
meat
in
the
Pharisee's
brough
t
an
alabaster
box
of
Luke7:38
And
stood
at
his
feet
behind
him
and
began
to
wash
his
feet
with
and
did
wipe
them
with
the
hairs
of
her
h
ead,
and
kissed
his
and
anointed
them
with
the
Luke7:39
Now
when
the
Pharisee
which
had
bidden
him
saw
he
spake
within
This
if
he
were
a
would
have
known
who
and
what
manner
of
woman
this
is
that
toucheth
for
she
is
a
Luke7:40
And
Jesus
answering
said
unto
I
have
somewhat
to
say
unto
And
he
say
Luke7:41
There
was
a
certain
creditor
which
had
two
the
one
owed
five
hundred
and
the
other
Luke7:42
And
when
they
had
nothing
to
he
frankly
forgave
them
Tell
me
which
of
them
will
love
him
Luke7:43
Simon
answered
and
I
suppose
that
to
whom
he
forgave
And
he
said
unto
Thou
hast
rightly
Luke7:44
And
he
turned
to
the
and
said
unto
Seest
thou
this
I
entered
into
thine
thou
gavest
me
no
wate
r
for
my
but
she
hath
washed
my
feet
with
and
wiped
them
with
the
hairs
of
her
Luke7:45
Thou
gavest
me
no
but
this
woman
since
the
time
I
came
in
hath
not
ceased
to
kiss
my
Luke7:46
My
head
with
oil
thou
didst
not
but
this
woman
hath
anointed
my
feet
with
Luke7:47
Wherefore
I
say
unto
Her
which
are
are
for
she
loved
but
to
whom
little
is
the
same
loveth
Luke7:48
And
he
said
unto
Thy
sins
are
Luke7:49
And
they
that
sat
at
meat
with
him
began
to
say
within
Who
is
this
that
forgiveth
sins
Luke7:50
And
he
said
to
the
Thy
faith
hath
saved
go
in
Luke8:1
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
went
throughout
every
city
and
preaching
and
shewing
the
glad
tidings
of
th
e
kingdom
of
and
the
twelve
were
with
Luke8:2
And
certain
which
had
been
healed
of
evil
spirits
and
infirmities,
Mary
called
out
of
whom
went
seven
dev
ils,
Luke8:3
And
Joanna
the
wife
of
Chuza
Herod's
and
and
many
which
ministered
unto
him
of
their
Luke8:4
And
when
much
people
were
gathered
and
were
come
to
him
out
of
every
he
spake
by
a
Luke8:5
A
sower
went
out
to
sow
his
and
as
he
sowed,
some
fell
by
the
way
and
it
was
trodden
and
the
fowls
of
the
air
devoured
Luke8:6
And
some
fell
upon
a
and
as
soon
as
it
was
sprung
it
withered
because
it
lacked
Luke8:7
And
some
fell
among
and
the
thorns
sprang
up
with
and
choked
Luke8:8
And
other
fell
on
good
and
sprang
and
bare
fruit

And
when
he
had
said
these
he
H
e
that
hath
ears
to
let
him
Luke8:9
And
his
disciples
asked
What
might
this
parable
Luke8:10
And
he
Unto
you
it
is
given
to
know
the
mysteries
of
the
kingdom
of
but
to
others
in
that
seeing
they
might
not
and
hearing
they
might
not
Luke8:11
Now
the
parable
is
The
seed
is
the
word
of
Luke8:12
Those
by
the
way
side
are
they
that
then
cometh
the
and
taketh
away
the
word
out
of

Luke8:13
They
on

rock
are
when
they
receive

word
with

these
have
no
which
for
a
while
bel

and
in
time
of
temptation
fall
Luke8:14
And
that
which
fell
among
thorns
are
when
they
have
go
and
are
choked
with
cares
and
riches
and
pleasures
of
this
and
bring
no
fruit
to
Luke8:15
But
that
on
the
good
ground
are

setteth
it
on

For
nothing
is
that

not
be
made
neither

Take
heed
therefore
how
ye
for
whosoever
to
him
shall
be
and
whosoever
hath
from
him
shall
be
take
n
even
that
which
he
seemeth
to
Luke8:19
Then
came
to
him
his
mother
and
his
and
could
not
come
at
him
for
the
Luke8:20
And
it
was
told
him
by
certain
which
Thy
mother
and
thy
brethren
stand
desiring
to
see
Luke8:21
And
he
answered
and
said
unto
My
mother
and
my
brethren
are
these
which
hear
the
word
of
and
do
Luke8:22
Now
it
came
to
pass
on
a
certain
that
he
went
into
a
ship
with
his
and
he
said
unto
Let
us
go
over

other
side
of

they
launched
Luke8:23
But
as
they
sailed
he
fell
and
there
came
down
a
storm
of
wind
on
the
and
they
were
filled
with

he

rebuked

And
they
arrived
at
the
country
of
the
Gadarenes,
which
is
over
against
Luke8:27
And
when
he
went
forth
to

met
him
out
of

city
a
certain

in

When
he
saw
he
cried
and
fell
down
before

with
a
loud
voice
What

to
do
with
thou
Son
of
God

Luke8:30
And
Jesus
asked
What

he
because
many
devils
were
entered
into

And
they
besought
him
that
he
would
not

to
go
out
into

And
there
was
there
an

he
suffered

Then
went
the
devils
out

down

into

When
they
that
fed

saw
what
was

went
and
told
it
in
the
city
and
in
the
Luke8:35
Then
they
went
out
to
see
what
was

came
to

found
the

the
devils
were

they
were

They

them

Then
the
whole
multitude
of
the
country
of
the
Gadarenes
round
about
besought
him
to
depart
from

they
were
taken
with
great

he
went
up
into

returned
back
Luke8:38
Now
the
man
out
of

the
devils
were

besought
him
that
he
might
be
with

Jesus
sent
him
Luke8:39

And
it
came
to

gladly

answered
Fear

And
they
laughed
him
to
knowing
that
she
was

And
he
put
them
all
and
took
her
by
the

And
her
spirit
came

she
arose

And
her
parents
were

he
charged
them
that
they
should

Then
he
called
his
twelve
disciples
and
gave
them
power
and
authority
over

And
he
sent

Now
Herod
the
tetrarch
heard
of

that
it
was
said
of
that
John
was

from

And
of
that
Elias
had
and
of
that
one
of

And
Herod

but
who

And
he
desired
to
see

And
the
when
they
were
told
him
all
that
they

And
he
took
and
went
aside
privately
int

desert
place
belonging
to

city
called

And
the
when

spake
unto
them
of

them
that

need
of

And
when
the
day
began
to
wear
then
came
the
and
said
unto
Send
the
multitude
that
they
may
go
in
to
the
towns
and
country
round
and
and
get

we
are
here
in

desert
Luke9:13
But
he
said
unto
Give
ye
them
to
And
they
We
have
no
more
but
five
loaves
and
two
except
we
shoul
d
go
and
buy
meat
for
all
this
Luke9:14
For
they
were
about
five
thousand
And
he
said
to
his
Make
them
sit
down
by
fifties
in
a
Luke9:15
And
they
did
and
made
them
all
sit
Luke9:16
Then
he
took
the
five
loaves
and
the
two
and
looking
up
to

blessed
and
and
gave
to
the
dis

to

they
did
and
were
all
and
there
was
taken
up
of
fragments
that
remained
to
them
twelve
Luke9:18
And
it
came
to
as
he
was
alone
his
disciples
were
with
and
he
asked
Whom
say
the
people
that
I
Luke9:19
They
answering
John
the
but
some
and
others
that
one
of
the
old
prophets
is
risen
Luke9:20
He
said
unto
But
whom
say
ye
that
I
Peter
answering
The
Christ
of
Luke9:21
And
he
straitly
charged
and
commanded
them
to
tell
no
man
that
Luke9:22
The
Son
of
man
must
suffer
many
and
be
rejected
of
the
elders
and
chief
priests
and
and
be
and
be
raised

third
Luke9:23
And
he
said
to
them
If
any
man
will
come
after
let
him
deny
and
take
up
his
cross
and
follow
Luke9:24
For
whosoever
will
save
his
life
shall
lose
but
whosoever
will
lose
his
life
for
my
the
same
shall
save
Luke9:25
For
what
is
a
man
if
he
gain
the
whole
and
lose
or
be
cast
Luke9:26
For
whosoever
shall
be
ashamed
of
me
and
of
my
of
him
shall
the
Son
of
man
be
when
he
shall
come
in
his
ow

and
in
his
and
of
the
holy
Luke9:27
But
I
tell
you
of
a
there
be
some
standing
which
shall
not
taste
of
till
they
see
the
kingdom
of
Luke9:28
And
it
came
to
pass
about
an
eight
days
after
these
he
took
Peter
and
John
and
and
went
up
into
a
mountain
to
Luke9:29
And
as
he
the
fashion
of
his
countenance
was
and
his
raiment
was
white
and
glistering.
Luke9:30
there
talked
with
him
two
which
were
Moses
and
Luke9:31
Who
appeared
in
and
spake
of
his
decease
which
he
should
accomplish
at
Luke9:32
But
Peter
and
they
that
were
with
him
were
heavy
with
and
when
they
were
they
saw
his
and
the
two
men
that
stood
with
Luke9:33
And
it
came
to
as
they
departed
from
Peter
said
unto
it
is
good
for
us
to
be
and
let
us
ma
ke
three
one
for
and
one
for
and
one
for
not
knowing
what
he
Luke9:34
While
he
thus
there
came
a
and
overshadowed
and
they
feared
as
they
entered
into
the
Luke9:35
And
there
came
a
voice
out
of
the
This
is
my
beloved
hear
Luke9:36
And
when
the
voice
was
Jesus
was
found
And
they
kept
it
and
told
no
man
in
those
days
any
of
those
thi
ngs
which
they
had
Luke9:37
And
it
came
to
that
on
the
next
when
they
were
come
down
from
the
much
people
met
Luke9:38
a
man
of
the
company
cried
I
beseech
look
upon
my
for
he
is
mine
only
Luke9:39
a
spirit
taketh
and
he
suddenly
crieth
and
it
teareth
him
that
he
foameth
and
bruising
him
hardl
y
departeth
from
Luke9:40
And
I
besought
thy
disciples
to
cast
him
and
they
could
Luke9:41
And
Jesus
answering
O
faithless
and
perverse
how
long
shall
I
be
with
and
suffer
Bring
thy
son
Luke9:42
And
as
he
was
yet
a
the
devil
threw
him
and
tare
And
Jesus
rebuked
the
unclean
and
healed
the
c
hild,
and
delivered
him
again
to
his
Luke9:43
And
they
were
all
amazed
at
the
mighty
power
of
But
while
they
wondered
every
one
at
all
things
which
Jesus
he
s
aid
unto
his
Luke9:44
Let
these
sayings
sink
down
into
your
for
the
Son
of
man
shall
be
delivered
into
the
hands
of
Luke9:45
But
they
understood
not
this
and
it
was
hid
from
that
they
perceived
it
and
they
feared
to
ask
him
of
t
hat
Luke9:46
Then
there
arose
a
reasoning
among
which
of
them
should
be
Luke9:47
And
perceiving
the
thought
of
their
took
a
and
set
him
by
Luke9:48
And
said
unto
Whosoever
shall
receive
this
child
in
my
name
receiveth
and
whosoever
shall
receive
me
receiveth
h
im
that
sent
for
he
that
is
least
among
you
the
same
shall
be
Luke9:49
And
John
answered
and
we
saw
one
casting
out
devils
in
thy
and
we
forbad
because
he
followeth
not
with
Luke9:50
And
Jesus
said
unto
Forbid
him
for
he
that
is
not
against
us
is
for
Luke9:51
And
it
came
to
when
the
time
was
come
that
he
should
be
received
he
stedfastly
set
his
face
to
go
to
Luke9:52
And
sent
messengers
before
his
and
they
and
entered
into
a
village
of
the
Samaritans,
to
make
ready
for
Luke9:53
And
they
did
not
receive
because
his
face
was
as
though
he
would
go
to
Luke9:54
And
when
his
disciples
James
and
John
saw
they
wilt
thou
that
we
command
fire
to
come
down
from
and
consume
even
as
Elias
Luke9:55
But
he
and
rebuked
and
Ye
know
not
what
manner
of
spirit
ye
are
Luke9:56
For
the
Son
of
man
is
not
come
to
destroy
men's
but
to
save
And
they
went
to
another
Luke9:57
And
it
came
to
as
they
went
in
the
a
certain
man
said
unto
I
will
follow
thee
whithersoever
th
ou
goest.
Luke9:58
And
Jesus
said
unto
Foxes
have
and
birds
of
the
air
have
but
the
Son
of
man
hath
not
where
to
lay
his
h
ead.
Luke9:59
And
he
said
unto
Follow
But
he
suffer
me
first
to
go
and
bury
my
Luke9:60
Jesus
said
unto
Let
the
dead
bury
their
but
go
thou
and
preach
the
kingdom
of
Luke9:61
And
another
also
I
will
follow
but
let
me
first
go
bid
them
which
are
at
home
at
my
Luke9:62
And
Jesus
said
unto
No
having
put
his
hand
to
the
and
looking
is
fit
for
the
kingdom
of
Luke10:1
After
these
things
the
LORD
appointed
other
seventy
and
sent
them
two
and
two
before
his
face
into
every
city
and
pl
whither

himself

Therefore
said
he
unto
The

And
if
the
son
of

be
your
peace
shall
rest
upon

it
shall

Luke10:7
And
in
the

drinking
such
things
as

And
heal

into

But
I
say
unto
that
it
shall
be
more
tolerable
in
that
day
for
than
for
that
Luke10:13
Woe
unto
Chorazin!
woe
unto
for
if
the
mighty
works
had
been
done
in
Tyre
and
which
have
be
en
done
in

had
a
great
while
ago
sitting
in
sackcloth
and
Luke10:14
But
it
shall
be
more
tolerable
for
Tyre
and
Sidon
at
the
than
for
Luke10:15
And
which
art
exalted
to
shalt
be
thrust
down
to

He
that
heareth

heareth

And
the
seventy
returned
again
with

the
devils

subject
unto

through
thy
Luke10:18
And
he
said
unto
I
beheld
Satan
as
lightning
fall
from
Luke10:19
I
give
unto
you
power
to
tread
on
serpents
and

over
all
the
power
of

nothing
shall
by
any
means
hurt
Luke10:20
Notwithstanding
in
this
rejoice
that
the
spirits
are
subject
unto
but
rather
because
your
names
are
wr

in
Luke10:21
In
that
hour
Jesus
rejoiced
in
and
I
thank
O
Lord
of
heaven
and
that
thou
hast
hid
the

things
from
the
wise
and
and
hast
revealed
them
unto

turned

said
Blessed

I
tell

a
certain
lawyer
stood
and
tempted
what
shall
I
do
to
inherit

Luke10:26
He
said
unto
What
is
written
in

how
readest

answering
Thou

the
Lord
thy

with
all

and
with
all
thy
and
with
all
thy

thou
shalt

And
Jesus
answering
A
certain
man
went
down
from
Jerusalem
to
and
fell
among
which
stripped
him
o

his
and
wounded
and
leaving
him
half
Luke10:31
And
by
chance
there
came
down
a
certain
priest
that
and
when
he
saw
he
passed
by
on
the
other
Luke10:32
And
likewise
a
when
he
was
at
the
came
and
looked
on
and
passed
by
on
the
other
Luke10:33
But
a
certain
as
he
came
where
he
and
when
he
saw
he
had
compassion
on
Luke10:34
And
went
to
and
bound
up
his
pouring
in
oil
and
and
set
him
on
his
own
and
brought
him
to
an
in
n,
and
took
care
of
Luke10:35
And
on
the
morrow
when
he
he
took
out
two
and
gave
them
to
the
and
said
unto
Take
care
of
him
;
and
whatsoever
thou
spendest
when
I
come
I
will
repay
Luke10:36
Which
now
of
these
thinkest
was
neighbour
unto
him
that
fell
among
the
Luke10:37
And
he
He
that
shewed
mercy
on
Then
said
Jesus
unto
and
do
thou
Luke10:38
Now
it
came
to
as
they
that
he
entered
into
a
certain
and
a
certain
woman
named
Martha
received
him
into
her
Luke10:39
And
she
had
a
sister
called
which
also
sat
at
and
heard
his
Luke10:40
But
Martha
was
cumbered
about
much
and
came
to
and
dost
thou
not
care
that
my
sister
hath
left
me
to
serve
bid
her
therefore
that
she
help
Luke10:41
And
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
thou
art
careful
and
troubled
about
many
Luke10:42
But
one
thing
is
and
Mary
hath
chosen
that
good
which
shall
not
be
taken
away
from
Luke11:1
And
it
came
to
as
he
was
praying
in
a
certain
when
he
one
of
his
disciples
said
unto
teach
us
to
as
John
also
taught
his
Luke11:2
And
he
said
unto
When

Our
Father
which
art

Hallowed

thy
Thy
kingdom
Thy
will
be

in
so
in
Luke11:3
Give
us
day
by

our
daily
Luke11:4
And
forgive
us
our
for
we
also
forgive
every
one
that
is
indebted
to
And
lead
us
not
into
but
delive

us
from

he
said
unto
Which
of

shall
have

shall
go
unto
him
at

say
unto
lend
me
three

For
a
friend
of
mine
in
his
journey
is
come
to
and
I
have
nothing
to
set
before
Luke11:7
And
he
from
within
shall
answer
and
Trouble

door
is
now
and
my
children
are
with
me
in

I
say
unto
Though
he
will
not
rise
and
give
because
he
is
his
yet
because
of
his
importunity
he
will
ris

and
give
him
as
many
as
he
needeth.
Luke11:9
And
I
say
unto
and
it
shall
be
given
and
ye
shall

it
shall
be
opened
unto
Luke11:10
For
every
one

besought

And
when
the
Pharisee

marvelled
that
he

And
the
Lord
said
unto
Now

ye
Pharisees
make

But
rather
give
alms
of
such

as
ye
all

are

unto
Luke11:42
But
woe
unto
Pharisees!
for
ye
tithe
mint

over

love
of

these
ought
ye

Woe
unto
Pharisees!
for
ye
love
the
uppermost
seats
in

greetings
in

Luke11:44
Woe
unto

for
ye

Then
answered
one
of

said
unto

saying

And
as
he
said
these
things
unto
the
scribes
and
the
Pharisees
began
to
urge
him

to
provoke
him
to

of

Laying
wait
for

seeking
to
catch
something
out
of

they
might

In

when
there
were

together
an

began
to
say
unto
his
disciples
first
of
Beware
ye
of

Pharisees,
which
is
Luke12:2
For
there
is
nothing
that

neither
that

Luke12:3
Therefore
whatsoever
ye
have
spoken
in
darkness
shall
be
heard
in
the
and
that
which
ye
have
spoken
in
the
ear
in

be
proclaimed
upon

And
I
say
unto
you
my
Be

of

But
I
will
forewarn
you

But
even
the
very
hairs
of
your
head
are
all
Fear
not

of
more
value
than
many
Luke12:8
Also
I
say
unto
Whosoever
shall
confess
me
before
him
shall
the
Son
of
man
also
confess
before
the
angels
of
God
:
Luke12:9
But
he
that
denieth
me
before
men
shall
be
denied
before
the
angels
of
Luke12:10
And
whosoever
shall
speak
a
word
against
the
Son
of
it
shall
be
forgiven
but
unto
him
that
blasphemeth
against
the
Holy
Ghost
it
shall
not
be

And
when
they
bring
you
unto
the
and
unto

take
ye
no
thought
how
or
what
thing
ye
sh
all
or
what

For
the
Holy
Ghost
shall
teach
you

And
one
of
the
company
said
unto

to
my
that

inheritance
with
Luke12:14
And
he
said
unto
who
made
me
a
judge
or
a
divider
over
Luke12:15
And
he
said
unto
Take
and
beware
of

a
man's
life
consisteth
not
in
the
abundance
of
the
thi

which
he
possesseth.
Luke12:16
And
he
spake
a
parable
unto
The
ground
of
a
certain
rich
man
brought
forth
Luke12:17
And
he
thought
within
What
shall
I
because
I
have
no
room
where
to
bestow
my
Luke12:18
And
he
This
will
I
I
will
pull
down
my

build
and
there
will
I
bestow
all
my
fruits
and
my
g

Luke12:19
And
I
will
say
to
my

So
is
he
that
layeth
up
treasure
for
and
is
not
rich
toward
Luke12:22
And
he
said
unto
his
Therefore
I
say
unto
Take
no
thought
for
your
what

what

The

more

If

And

Luke12:30
For
all
these
things
do
the
nations
of
the
world
seek
and
your
Father
knoweth
that
ye
have
need
of
these
Luke12:31
But
rather
seek
ye
the
kingdom
of

all
these
things
shall
be
added
unto
Luke12:32
Fear
little
for
it

your

good
pleasure
to

For

Let
your

the
ruler
of
the
synagogue
answered
with
because
that
Jesus
had
healed
on
the
sabbath
and
said
unto
the
There
are
six
days
in
which
men
ought
to
in
them
therefore
come
and
be
and
not
on
the
sabbath
Luke13:15
The
Lord
then
answered
and
Thou
doth
not
each
one
of
you
on
the
sabbath
loose
his
ox
or
his
ass
fro
m
the
and
lead
him
away
to
Luke13:16
And
ought

being
a
daughter
of

Satan
hath

eighteen

loosed
from
th

on

sabbath
Luke13:17
And
when
he
had
said
these
all
his
adversaries
were
and
all
the
people
rejoiced
for
all
the
glorious
thi

that
were
done
by
Luke13:18
Then
said
Unto
what
is
the
kingdom
of
God
and
whereunto
shall
I
resemble
Luke13:19
It
is
like
a
grain
of
mustard
which
a
man
and
cast
into
his
and
it
and
waxed
a
great
and
the
fowls
of
the
air
lodged
in
the
branches
of
Luke13:20
And
again
he
Whereunto
shall
I
liken
the
kingdom
of
Luke13:21
It
is
like
which
a
woman
took
and
hid
in
three
measures
of
till
the
whole
was
Luke13:22
And
he
went
through
the
cities
and
and
journeying
toward

Then
said
one
unto

there
few
that

And
he
said
unto
Luke13:24
Strive
to
enter

say
unto
will
seek
to
enter

But
he
shall
I
tell
I

not

ye
depart
from

workers
of

There
shall
be

The
same
day
there
came
certain
of
the
Pharisees,
saying
unto
Get
thee
and
depart
for

will
kill

Luke13:32
And
he
said
unto
Go
and
tell
that
I
cast

I
do
cures
to

to

the
third

is
he
that
cometh
in
the
name
of
the
Luke14:1
And
it
came
to
as
he
went
into
the
house
of
one
of
the
chief
Pharisees
to
eat
bread
on
the
sabbath
that
they
wa
tched
Luke14:2
there
was
a
certain
man
before
him
which
had
the
Luke14:3
And
Jesus
answering
spake
unto
the
lawyers
and
Pharisees,
Is
it
lawful
to
heal
on
the
sabbath
Luke14:4
And
they
held
their
And
he
took
and
healed
and
let
him
Luke14:5
And
answered
Which
of
you
shall
have
an
ass
or
an
ox
fallen
into
a
and
will
not
straightway
pull
him
ou
t
on
the
sabbath
Luke14:6
And
they
could
not
answer
him
again
to
these
Luke14:7
And
he
put
forth
a
parable
to
those
which
were
when
he
marked
how
they
chose
out
the
chief
saying
unto
them
,
Luke14:8
When
thou
art
bidden
of
any
man
to
a
sit
not
down
in
the
highest
lest
a
more
honourable
man
than
thou
be
bi
dden
of
Luke14:9
And
he
that
bade
thee
and
him
come
and
say
to
Give
this
man
and
thou
begin
with
shame
to
take
the
lowest
room
.
Luke14:10
But
when
thou
art
go
and
sit
down
in
the
lowest
that
when
he
that
bade
thee
he
may
say
unto
F
riend,
go
up
then
shalt
thou
have
worship
in
the
presence
of
them
that
sit
at
meat
with
Luke14:11
For
whosoever
exalteth
himself
shall
be
and
he
that
humbleth
himself
shall
be
Luke14:12
Then
said
he
also
to
him
that
bade
When
thou
makest
a
dinner
or
a
call
not
thy
nor
thy
ne
ither
thy
nor
thy
rich
lest
they
also
bid
thee
and
a
recompence
be
made
Luke14:13
But
when
thou
makest
a
call
the
the
the
the
Luke14:14
And
thou
shalt
be
for
they
cannot
recompense
for
thou
shalt
be
recompensed
at
the
resurrection
of
the
just
.
Luke14:15
And
when
one
of
them
that
sat
at
meat
with
him
heard
these
he
said
unto
Blessed
is
he
that
shall
eat
bread
i
n
the
kingdom
of
Luke14:16
Then
said
he
unto
A
certain
man
made
a
great
and
bade
Luke14:17
And
sent
his
servant
at
supper
time
to
say
to
them
that
were
for
all
things
are
now
Luke14:18
And
they
all
with
one
consent
began
to
make
The
first
said
unto
I
have
bought
a
piece
of
and
I
must
needs
go
and
see
I
pray
thee
have
me
Luke14:19
And
another
I
have
bought
five
yoke
of
and
I
go
to
prove
I
pray
thee
have
me
Luke14:20
And
another
I
have
married
a
and
therefore
I
cannot
Luke14:21
So
that
servant
and
shewed
his
lord
these
Then
the
master
of
the
house
being
angry
said
to
his
Go
out
quickly
into
the
streets
and
lanes
of
the
and
bring
in
hither
the
and
the
and
the
and
the
Luke14:22
And
the
servant
it
is
done
as
thou
hast
and
yet
there
is
Luke14:23
And
the
lord
said
unto
the
Go
out
into
the
highways
and
and
compel
them
to
come
that
my
house
may
be
Luke14:24
For
I
say
unto
That
none
of
those
men
which
were
bidden
shall
taste
of
my
Luke14:25
And
there
went
great
multitudes
with
and
he
and
said
unto
Luke14:26
If
any
man
come
to
and
hate
not
his
and
and
and
and
and
and
h
is
own
life
he
cannot
be
my
Luke14:27
And
whosoever
doth
not
bear
his
and
come
after
cannot
be
my
Luke14:28
For
which
of
intending
to
build
a
sitteth
not
down
and
counteth
the
whether
he
have
sufficient
t
o
finish
Luke14:29
Lest
after
he
hath
laid
the
and
is
not
able
to
finish
all
that
behold
it
begin
to
mock
Luke14:30
This
man
began
to
and
was
not
able
to
Luke14:31
Or
what
going
to
make
war
against
another
sitteth
not
down
and
consulteth
whether
he
be
able
with
ten
thousand
to
meet
him
that
cometh
against
him
with
twenty
Luke14:32
Or
while
the
other
is
yet
a
great
way
he
sendeth
an
ambassage,
and
desireth
conditions
of
Luke14:33
So
whosoever
he
be
of
you
that
forsaketh
not
all
that
he
he
cannot
be
my
Luke14:34
Salt
is
but
if
the
salt
have
lost
his
wherewith
shall
it
be
Luke14:35
It
is
neither
fit
for
the
nor
yet
for
the
but
men
cast
it
He
that
hath
ears
to
let
him
Luke15:1
Then
drew
near
unto
him
all
the
publicans
and
sinners
for
to
hear
Luke15:2
And
the
Pharisees
and
scribes
This
man
receiveth
and
eateth
with
Luke15:3
And
he
spake
this
parable
unto
Luke15:4
What
man
of
having
an
hundred
if
he
lose
one
of
doth
not
leave
the
ninety
and
nine
in
the
an
d
go
after
that
which
is
until
he
find
Luke15:5
And
when
he
hath
found
he
layeth
it
on
his
Luke15:6
And
when
he
cometh
he
calleth
together
his
friends
and
saying
unto
Rejoice
with
for
I
have
fou
nd
my
sheep
which
was
Luke15:7
I
say
unto
that
likewise
joy
shall
be
in
heaven
over
one
sinner
that
repenteth,
more
than
over
ninety
and
nine
just
p
ersons,
which
need
no
Luke15:8
Either
what
woman
having
ten
pieces
of
if
she
lose
one
doth
not
light
a
and
sweep
the
and
se
ek
diligently
till
she
find
Luke15:9
And
when
she
hath
found
she
calleth
her
friends
and
her
neighbours
Rejoice
with
for
I
have
found
the
piece
which
I
had
Luke15:10
I
say
unto
there
is
joy
in
the
presence
of
the
angels
of
God
over
one
sinner
that
repenteth.
Luke15:11
And
he
A
certain
man
had
two
Luke15:12
And
the
younger
of
them
said
to
his
give
me
the
portion
of
goods
that
falleth
to
And
he
divided
unto
them
his
Luke15:13
And
not
many
days
after
the
younger
son
gathered
all
and
took
his
journey
into
a
far
and
there
wasted
his
substance
with
riotous
Luke15:14
And
when
he
had
spent
there
arose
a
mighty
famine
in
that
and
he
began
to
be
in
Luke15:15
And
he
went
and
joined
himself
to
a
citizen
of
that
and
he
sent
him
into
his
fields
to
feed
Luke15:16
And
he
would
fain
have
filled
his
belly
with
the
husks
that
the
swine
did
and
no
man
gave
unto
Luke15:17
And
when
he
came
to
he
How
many
hired
servants
of
my
father's
have
bread
enough
and
to
and
I
perish
with
Luke15:18
I
will
arise
and
go
to
my
and
will
say
unto
I
have
sinned
against
and
before
Luke15:19
And
am
no
more
worthy
to
be
called
thy
make
me
as
one
of
thy
hired
Luke15:20
And
he
and
came
to
his
But
when
he
was
yet
a
great
way
his
father
saw
and
had
and
ra
n,
and
fell
on
his
and
kissed
Luke15:21
And
the
son
said
unto
I
have
sinned
against
and
in
thy
and
am
no
more
worthy
to
be
called
thy
Luke15:22
But
the
father
said
to
his
Bring
forth
the
best
and
put
it
on
and
put
a
ring
on
his
and
shoes
on
his
Luke15:23
And
bring
hither
the
fatted
and
kill
and
let
us
and
be
Luke15:24
For
this
my
son
was
and
is
alive
he
was
and
is
And
they
began
to
be
Luke15:25
Now
his
elder
son
was
in
the
and
as
he
came
and
drew
nigh
to
the
he
heard
musick
and
Luke15:26
And
he
called
one
of
the
and
asked
what
these
things
Luke15:27
And
he
said
unto
Thy
brother
is
and
thy
father
hath
killed
the
fatted
because
he
hath
received
him
safe
and
Luke15:28
And
he
was
and
would
not
go
therefore
came
his
father
and
intreated
Luke15:29
And
he
answering
said
to
his
these
many
years
do
I
serve
neither
transgressed
I
at
any
time
thy
command
ment:
and
yet
thou
never
gavest
me
a
that
I
might
make
merry
with
my
Luke15:30
But
as
soon
as
this
thy
son
was
which
hath
devoured
thy
living
with
thou
hast
killed
for
him
the
fatted
ca
lf.
Luke15:31
And
he
said
unto
thou
art
ever
with
and
all
that
I
have
is
Luke15:32
It
was
meet
that
we
should
make
and
be
for
this
thy
brother
was
and
is
alive
and
was
and
is
Luke16:1
And
he
said
also
unto
his
There
was
a
certain
rich
which
had
a
and
the
same
was
accused
unto
him
that
he
had
wasted
his
Luke16:2
And
he
called
and
said
unto
How
is
it
that
I
hear
this
of
give
an
account
of
thy
for
thou
may
est
be
no
longer
Luke16:3
Then
the
steward
said
within
What
shall
I
for
my
lord
taketh
away
from
me
the
I
cannot
to
b
eg
I
am
Luke16:4
I
am
resolved
what
to
when
I
am
put
out
of
the
they
may
receive
me
into
their
Luke16:5
So
he
called
every
one
of
his
lord's
debtors
unto
and
said
unto
the
How
much
owest
thou
unto
my
Luke16:6
And
he
An
hundred
measures
of
And
he
said
unto
Take
thy

sit
down
and
write

Then
said
he
to
And
how
much
owest
And
he
An
hundred

of
And
he
said
unto
Take

Luke16:8
And
the
lord
commended
the
unjust
because
he
had
done
for
the
children
of
this
world
are
in
their
generat
ion
wiser
than
the
children
of
Luke16:9
And
I
say
unto
Make
to
yourselves
friends
of
the
mammon
of
when
ye
they
may
receive
you
into

Luke16:10
He
that

faithful
in
that
which
is
least
is
faithful
also
in
and
he
that
is
unjust
in
the
least
is
unjust
also
in
Luke16:11
If
therefore
ye
have
not
been
faithful
in
the
unrighteous
who
will
commit
to
your
trust
the
true
Luke16:12
And
if
ye
have
not

love

else
he
will
hold

despise

Ye
cannot
serve
God
and
Luke16:14
And
the
Pharisees
who
were
heard
all
these
and
they
derided
Luke16:15
And
he
said
unto
Ye
are
they
which
justify
yourselves
before
but
God
knoweth
your
for
that
which
is
hi
ghly
esteemed
among
men
is
abomination
in
the
sight
of
Luke16:16
The
law
and
the
prophets
were
until
since
that
time
the
kingdom
of
God
is
and
every
man
presseth
into
Luke16:17
And
it
is
easier
for
heaven
and
earth
to
than
one
tittle
of
the
law
to
Luke16:18
Whosoever
putteth

whosoever
marrieth

There
was
a
certain
rich
which
was
clothed
in
purple
and
fine
and
fared
sumptuously
every
Luke16:20
And
there
was
a
certain
beggar
named
which
was
laid
at
his
full
of
Luke16:21
And
desiring
to
be
fed
with
the
crumbs
which
fell
from
the
rich
man's
moreover
the
dogs
came
and
licked
his
Luke16:22
And
it
came
to
that
the
beggar
and
was
carried
by
the
angels
into
Abraham's
the
rich
man
also
an

Luke16:23
And
in
hell
he
lift
up
his
being
in
and
seeth
Abraham
afar
and
Lazarus
in
his
Luke16:24
And
he
cried
and
Father
have
mercy
on
and
send
that
he
may
dip
the
tip
of
his
finger
in
water
,
and
cool
my
for
I
am
tormented
in
this
Luke16:25
But
Abraham
remember
that
thou
in
thy
lifetime
receivedst
thy
good
and
likewise
Lazarus
evil
b
ut
now
he
is
and
thou
art
Luke16:26
And
beside
all
between
us
and
you
there
is
a
great
gulf
so
that
they
which
would
pass
from
hence
to
you
cann
ot;
neither
can
they
pass
to

would
come
from
Luke16:27
Then
he
I
pray
thee
that
thou
wouldest
send
him
to
my
father's
Luke16:28
For
I
have
five
that
he
may

Luke17:9
Doth

thank
that
servant
because

things
that

Luke17:10
So

it
came
to
as

went
to
that
he
passed
through

midst
of
Samaria
and
Luke17:12
And
as
he
entered
into
a
certain
there
met
him
ten
men
that
were

stood
afar

they
lifted
up

on

of

saw
that
he
was
turned
and
with
a
loud
voice
glorified
Luke17:16
And
fell
down
on
his
face
at
his
giving

he
was
a

And
Jesus
answering
Were
there
not
ten
but
where
are
the
Luke17:18
There
are
not
found
that
returned
to
give
glory
to
save
this
Luke17:19
And
he
said
unto
go
thy
thy
faith
hath
made
thee
Luke17:20
And
when
he
was
demanded
of
the
Pharisees,
when
the
kingdom
of
God
should
he
answered
them
and
The
kingdom
of
God
cometh
not
with
Luke17:21
Neither
shall
they
Lo
lo
the
kingdom
of
God
is
within
Luke17:22
And
he
said
unto
the
The
days
will
when
ye
shall
desire
to
see
one
of
the
days
of
the
Son
of
and
ye
shall
not
see
Luke17:23
And
they
shall
say
to
See
see
go
not
after
nor
follow
Luke17:24
For
as
the
that
lighteneth
out
of
the
one
part
under
shineth
unto
the
other
part
under
so
shal
l
also
the
Son
of
man
be
in
his
Luke17:25
But
first
must
he
suffer
many
and
be
rejected
of
this
Luke17:26
And
as
it
was
in
the
days
of
Noe,
so
shall
it
be
also
in
the
days
of
the
Son
of
Luke17:27
They
did
they
they
married
they
were
given
in
until
the
day
that
Noe
entered
into
the
a

the
flood

destroyed
them

Likewise
also
as
it
was
in
the
days
of

did
they
they
they
they
they
Luke17:29
But
the
same
day
that
Lot
went
out
of
Sodom
it
rained
fire
and
brimstone
from
and
destroyed
them
Luke17:30
Even
thus
shall
it
be
in
the
day
when
the
Son
of
man
is
Luke17:31
In
that
he
which
shall
be
upon

and
his
stuff

him
not
come
down
to
take
it
and
he
that
is
in

let
him
likewise
not
return

Remember
Lot's
Luke17:33
Whosoever
shall
seek
to
save
his
life
shall
lose
and
whosoever
shall
lose
his
life
shall
preserve
Luke17:34
I
tell
in
that
night
there
shall
be
two
men
in
one
the
one
shall
be
and
the
other
shall
be
Luke17:35
Two
women
shall
be

Luke17:36
Two
men
shall

And
they
answered
and
said
unto
And
he
said
unto
Wheresoever
the
body
thither
will
the
eagles
be
gathered
Luke18:1
And
he
spake
a
parable
unto
them
to
this
that
men
ought
always
to
and
not
to
Luke18:2
There
was
in
a
city
a
which
feared
not
neither
regarded
Luke18:3
And
there
was
a
widow
in
that
and
she
came
unto
Avenge
me
of
mine
Luke18:4
And
he
would
not
for
a
but
afterward
he
said
within
Though
I
fear
not
nor
regard
Luke18:5
Yet
because
this
widow
troubleth
I
will
avenge
lest
by
her
continual
coming
she
weary
Luke18:6
And
the
Lord
Hear
what
the
unjust
judge
Luke18:7
And
shall
not
God
avenge
his
own
which
cry
day
and
night
unto
though
he
bear
long
with
Luke18:8
I
tell
you
that
he
will
avenge
them
Nevertheless
when
the
Son
of
man
shall
he
find
faith
on
the
Luke18:9
And
he
spake
this
parable
unto
certain
which
trusted
in
themselves
that
they
were
and
despised
Luke18:10
Two
men
went
up
into
the
temple
to
the
one
a
and
the
other
a
Luke18:11
The
Pharisee
stood
and
prayed
thus
with
I
thank
that
I
am
not
as
other
men
extortioners,
or
even
as
this
Luke18:12
I
fast
twice
in
the
I
give
tithes
of
all
that
I
Luke18:13
And
the
standing
afar
would
not
lift
up
so
much
as
his
eyes
unto
but
smote
upon
his
saying
,
God
be
merciful
to
me
a
Luke18:14
I
tell
this
man
went
down
to
his
house
justified
rather
than
the
for
every
one
that
exalteth
himself
shall
be
and
he
that
humbleth
himself
shall
be
Luke18:15
And
they
brought
unto
him
also
that
he
would
touch
but
when
his
disciples
saw
they
rebuked
Luke18:16
But
Jesus
called
them
unto
and
Suffer
little
children
to
come
unto
and
forbid
them
for
of
such
is
the
kingdom
of
Luke18:17
Verily
I
say
unto
Whosoever
shall
not
receive
the
kingdom
of
God
as
a
little
child
shall
in
no
wise
enter
Luke18:18
And
a
certain
ruler
asked
Good
what
shall
I
do
to
inherit
eternal
Luke18:19
And
Jesus
said
unto
Why
callest
thou
me
none
is
save
that
Luke18:20
Thou
knowest
the
Do
not
commit
Do
not
Do
not
Do
not
bear
false
Honour
thy
f
ather
and
thy
Luke18:21
And
he
All
these
have
I
kept
from
my
youth
Luke18:22
Now
when
Jesus
heard
these
he
said
unto
Yet
lackest
thou
one
sell
all
that
thou
and
distribute
unto
the
and
thou
shalt
have
treasure
in
and
follow
Luke18:23
And
when
he
heard
he
was
very
for
he
was
very
Luke18:24
And
when
Jesus
saw
that
he
was
very
he
How
hardly
shall
they
that
have
riches
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
Luke18:25
For
it
is
easier
for
a
camel
to
go
through
a
needle's
than
for
a
rich
man
to
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
Luke18:26
And
they
that
heard
it
Who
then
can
be
Luke18:27
And
he
The
things
which
are
impossible
with
men
are
possible
with
Luke18:28
Then
Peter
we
have
left
and
followed
Luke18:29
And
he
said
unto
Verily
I
say
unto
There
is
no
man
that
hath
left
or
or
or
or
for
the
kingdom
of
God's
Luke18:30
Who
shall
not
receive
manifold
more
in
this
present
and
in
the
world
to
come
life
Luke18:31
Then
he
took
unto
him
the
and
said
unto
we
go
up
to
and
all
things
that
are
written
by
t
he
prophets
concerning
the
Son
of
man
shall
be
Luke18:32
For
he
shall
be
delivered
unto
the
and
shall
be
and
spitefully
and
spitted
Luke18:33
And
they
shall
scourge
and
put
him
to
and
the
third
day
he
shall
rise
Luke18:34
And
they
understood
none
of
these
and
this
saying
was
hid
from
neither
knew
they
the
things
which
were
spok
Luke18:35
And
it
came
to
that
as
he
was
come
nigh
unto
a
certain
blind
man
sat
by
the
way
side
Luke18:36
And
hearing
the
multitude
pass
he
asked
what
it
Luke18:37
And
they
told
that
Jesus
of
Nazareth
passeth
Luke18:38
And
he
thou
son
of
have
mercy
on
Luke18:39
And
they
which
went
before
rebuked
that
he
should
hold
his
but
he
cried
so
much
the
Thou
son
of
have
mercy
on
Luke18:40
And
Jesus
and
commanded
him
to
be
brought
unto
and
when
he
was
come
he
asked
Luke18:41
What
wilt
thou
that
I
shall
do
unto
And
he
that
I
may
receive
my
Luke18:42
And
Jesus
said
unto
Receive
thy
thy
faith
hath
saved
Luke18:43
And
immediately
he
received
his
and
followed
glorifying
and
all
the
when
they
saw
gave
prais
e
unto
Luke19:1
And
Jesus
entered
and
passed
through
Luke19:2
there
was
a
man
named
Zacchaeus,
which
was
the
chief
among
the
and
he
was
Luke19:3
And
he
sought
to
see
Jesus
who
he
and
could
not
for
the
because
he
was
little
of
Luke19:4
And
he
ran
and
climbed
up
into
a
sycomore
tree
to
see
for
he
was
to
pass
that
Luke19:5
And
when
Jesus
came
to
the
he
looked
and
saw
and
said
unto
Zacchaeus,
make
and
come
for
to
day
I
must
abide
at
thy
Luke19:6
And
he
made
and
came
and
received
him
Luke19:7
And
when
they
saw
they
all
That
he
was
gone
to
be
guest
with
a
man
that
is
a
Luke19:8
And
Zacchaeus
and
said
unto
the
the
half
of
my
goods
I
give
to
the
and
if
I
have
taken
an
y
thing
from
any
man
by
false
I
restore
him
Luke19:9
And
Jesus
said
unto
This
day
is
salvation
come
to
this
forsomuch
as
he
also
is
a
son
of
Luke19:10
For
the
Son
of
man
is
come
to
seek
and
to
save
that
which
was
Luke19:11
And
as
they
heard
these
he
added
and
spake
a
because
he
was
nigh
to
and
because
they
thought
that
the
kingdom
of
God
should
immediately
Luke19:12
He
said
A
certain
nobleman
went
into
a
far
country
to
receive
for
himself
a
and
to
Luke19:13
And
he
called
his
ten
and
delivered
them
ten
and
said
unto
Occupy
till
I
Luke19:14
But
his
citizens
hated
and
sent
a
message
after
We
will
not
have
this
man
to
reign
over
Luke19:15
And
it
came
to
that
when
he
was
having
received
the
then
he
commanded
these
servants
to
be
calle
d
unto
to
whom
he
had
given
the
that
he
might
know
how
much
every
man
had
gained
by
Luke19:16
Then
came
the
thy
pound
hath
gained
ten
Luke19:17
And
he
said
unto
thou
good
because
thou
hast
been
faithful
in
a
very
have
thou
authority
over
ten
Luke19:18
And
the
second
thy
pound
hath
gained
five
Luke19:19
And
he
said
likewise
to
Be
thou
also
over
five
Luke19:20
And
another
here
is
thy
which
I
have
kept
laid
up
in
a
Luke19:21
For
I
feared
because
thou
art
an
austere
thou
takest
up
that
thou
layedst
not
and
reapest
that
thou
dids
t
not
Luke19:22
And
he
saith
unto
Out
of
thine
own
mouth
will
I
judge
thou
wicked
Thou
knewest
that
I
was
an
austere
taking
up
that
I
laid
not
and
reaping
that
I
did
not
Luke19:23
Wherefore
then
gavest
not
thou
my
money
into
the
that
at
my
coming
I
might
have
required
mine
own
with
Luke19:24
And
he
said
unto
them
that
stood
Take
from
him
the
and
give
it
to
him
that
hath
ten
Luke19:25
(And
they
said
unto
he
hath
ten
pounds.)
Luke19:26
For
I
say
unto
That
unto
every
one
which
hath
shall
be
and
from
him
that
hath
even
that
he
hath
shall
be
taken
away
from
Luke19:27
But
those
mine
which
would
not
that
I
should
reign
over
bring
and
slay
them
before
Luke19:28
And
when
he
had
thus
he
went
ascending
up
to
Luke19:29
And
it
came
to
when
he
was
come
nigh
to
Bethphage
and
at
the
mount
called
the
mount
of
he
sent
two
of
his
Luke19:30
Go
ye
into
the
village
over
against

the
which
at
your
entering
ye
shall
find
a
colt
whereon
yet
nev

man
loose
and
bring
him
Luke19:31
And
if
any
man
ask
Why
do
ye
loose
thus
shall
ye
say
unto
Because
the
Lord
hath
need
of
Luke19:32
And
they
that
were
sent
went
their
and
found
even
as
he
had
said
unto
Luke19:33
And
as
they
were
loosing
the
the
owners
thereof
said
unto
Why
loose
ye
the
Luke19:34
And
they
The
Lord
hath
need
of
Luke19:35
And
they
brought
him
to
and
they
cast
their
garments
upon
the
and
they
set
Jesus
Luke19:36
And
as
he
they
spread
their
clothes
in
the
Luke19:37
And
when
he
was
come
even
now
at
the
descent
of
the
mount
of
the
whole
multitude
of
the
disciples
began
to
rejoice
and
praise
God
with
a
loud
voice
for
all
the
mighty
works
that
they
had
Luke19:38
Blessed
be
the
King
that
cometh
in
the
name
of
the
peace
in
and
glory
in
the
Luke19:39
And
some
of
the
Pharisees
from
among
the
multitude
said
unto
rebuke
thy
Luke19:40
And
he
answered
and
said
unto
I
tell
you
if
these
should
hold
their
the
stones
would
immediately
cry
o
Luke19:41
And
when
he
was
come
he
beheld
the
and
wept
over
Luke19:42
If
thou
hadst
even
at
least
in
this
thy
the
things
which
belong
unto
thy
but
now
they
ar

hid
from
thine
Luke19:43
For
the
days
shall
come
upon

thine
enemies
shall
cast
a
trench
about
and
compass
thee
and
keep
th

every

And
shall
lay
thee
even
with

and
thy
children
within
and
they
shall
not
leave
in
thee
one
stone
upon

thou
knewest
not
the
time
of
thy

And
he
went
into
the
and
began
to
cast
out
them
that
sold
and
them
that
Luke19:46
Saying
unto
It
is
My
house

made
it

And

very
attentive

it
came
to
that

one
of
those
as
he
taught
the
people
in

preached

came
upon
him
with
the

spake
unto

Luke20:3
And
he
answered
and
said
unto
I
will
also
ask
you
one
and
answer
Luke20:4
The
baptism
of

from
or
of

And
they
reasoned
with
If
we

From

will
Why
then
believed
ye
him
Luke20:6
But
and
if
we
Of
all
the
people
will
stone
for
they
be
persuaded
that
John
was
a
Luke20:7
And
they
that
they
could
not
tell
whence
it
Luke20:8
And
Jesus
said
unto
Neither
tell
I
you
by
what
authority
I
do

Luke20:9
Then
began
he
to
speak
to
the
people
this
A
certain
man
planted
a
and
let
it
forth
to
and
w
ent
into
a
far
country
for
a
long
Luke20:10
And
at
the
season
he
sent
a
servant
to
the
that
they
should
give
him
of
the
fruit
of
the
but
the
hu
sbandmen
beat
and
sent
him
away
Luke20:11
And
again
he
sent
another
and
they
beat
him
and
entreated
him
and
sent
him
away
Luke20:12
And
again
he
sent
a
and
they
wounded
him
and
cast
him
Luke20:13
Then
said
the
lord
of
the
What
shall
I
I
will
send
my
beloved
it
may
be
they
will
reverence
him
when
t
hey
see
Luke20:14
But
when
the
husbandmen
saw
they
reasoned
among
This
is
the
let
us
kill
that
th
e
inheritance
may
be
Luke20:15
So
they
cast
him
out
of
the
and
killed
What
therefore
shall
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
do
unto
Luke20:16
He
shall
come
and
destroy
these
and
shall
give
the
vineyard
to
And
when
they
heard
they
God
Luke20:17
And
he
beheld
and
What
is
this
then
that
is
The
stone
which
the
builders
the
same
is
becom
e
the
head
of
the
Luke20:18
Whosoever
shall
fall
upon
that
stone
shall
be
but
on
whomsoever
it
shall
it
will
grind
him
to
Luke20:19
And
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
the
same
hour
sought
to
lay
hands
on
and
they
feared
the
for
they
perc
eived
that
he
had
spoken
this
parable
against
Luke20:20
And
they
watched
and
sent
forth
which
should
feign
themselves
just
that
they
might
take
hold
of
his
word
s,
that
so
they
might
deliver
him
unto
the
power
and
authority
of
the
Luke20:21
And
they
asked
we
know
that
thou
sayest
and
teachest
neither
acceptest
thou
the
person
of
a
but
teachest
the
way
of
God
Luke20:22
Is
it
lawful
for
us
to
give
tribute
unto
or
Luke20:23
But
he
perceived
their
and
said
unto
Why
tempt
ye
Luke20:24
Shew
me
a
Whose
image
and
superscription
hath
They
answered
and
Caesar's.
Luke20:25
And
he
said
unto
Render
therefore
unto
Caesar
the
things
which
be
Caesar's,
and
unto
God
the
things
which
be
Luke20:26
And
they
could
not
take
hold
of
his
words
before
the
and
they
marvelled
at
his
and
held
their
Luke20:27
Then
came
to
him
certain
of
the
Sadducees,
which
deny
that
there
is
any
and
they
asked
Luke20:28
Moses
wrote
unto
If
any
man's
brother
having
a
and
he
die
without
that
his
broth
er
should
take
his
and
raise
up
seed
unto
his
Luke20:29
There
were
therefore
seven
and
the
first
took
a
and
died
without
Luke20:30
And
the
second
took
her
to
and
he
died
Luke20:31
And
the
third
took
and
in
like
manner
the
seven
and
they
left
no
and
Luke20:32
Last
of
all
the
woman
died
Luke20:33
Therefore
in
the
resurrection
whose
wife
of
them
is
for
seven
had
her
to
Luke20:34
And
Jesus
answering
said
unto
The
children
of
this
world
and
are
given
in
Luke20:35
But
they
which
shall
be
accounted
worthy
to
obtain
that
and
the
resurrection
from
the
neither
nor
are
given
in
Luke20:36
Neither
can
they
die
any
for
they
are
equal
unto
the
and
are
the
children
of
being
the
children
of
the
Luke20:37
Now
that
the
dead
are
even
Moses
shewed
at
the
when
he
calleth
the
Lord
the
God
of
and
the
God
of
and
the
God
of
Luke20:38
For
he
is
not
a
God
of
the
but
of
the
for
all
live
unto
Luke20:39
Then
certain
of
the
scribes
answering
thou
hast
well
Luke20:40
And
after
that
they
durst
not
ask
him
any
question
at
Luke20:41
And
he
said
unto
How
say
they
that
Christ
is
David's
Luke20:42
And
David
himself
saith
in
the
book
of
The
LORD
said
unto
my
Sit
thou
on
my
right
Luke20:43
Till
I
make
thine
enemies
thy
Luke20:44
David
therefore
calleth
him
how
is
he
then
his
Luke20:45
Then
in
the
audience
of
all
the
people
he
said
unto
his
Luke20:46
Beware
of
the
which
desire
to
walk
in
long
and
love
greetings
in
the
and
the
highest
seats
in
th
e
and
the
chief
rooms
at
Luke20:47
Which
devour
and
for
a
shew
make
long
the
same
shall
receive
greater
Luke21:1
And
he
looked
and
saw
the
rich
men
casting
their
gifts
into
the
Luke21:2
And
he
saw
also
a
certain
poor
widow
casting
in
thither
two
Luke21:3
And
he
Of
a
truth
I
say
unto
that
this
poor
widow
hath
cast
in
more
than
they
Luke21:4
For
all
these
have
of
their
abundance
cast
in
unto
the
offerings
of
but
she
of
her
penury
hath
cast
in
all
the
living
that
she
Luke21:5
And
as
some
spake
of
the
how
it
was
adorned
with
goodly
stones
and
he
Luke21:6
As
for
these
things
which
ye
the
days
will
in
the
which
there
shall
not
be
left
one
stone
upon
that
shall
not
be
thrown
Luke21:7
And
they
asked
but
when
shall
these
things
and
what
sign
will
there
be
when
these
things
shall
co
me
to
Luke21:8
And
he
Take
heed
that
ye
be
not
for
many
shall
come
in
my
I
am
and
the
time
draweth
go
ye
not
therefore
after
Luke21:9
But
when
ye
shall
hear
of
wars
and
be
not
for
these
things
must
first
come
to
but
the
end
is
not
by
and
Luke21:10
Then
said
he
unto
Nation
shall
rise
against
and
kingdom
against
Luke21:11
And
great
earthquakes
shall
be
in
divers
and
and
and
fearful
sights
and
great
signs
shall
t
here
be
from
Luke21:12
But
before
all
they
shall
lay
their
hands
on
and
persecute
delivering
you
up
to
the
and
into
being
brought
before
kings
and
rulers
for
my
name's
Luke21:13
And
it
shall
turn
to
you
for
a
Luke21:14
Settle
it
therefore
in
your
not
to
meditate
before
what
ye
shall
Luke21:15
For
I
will
give
you
a
mouth
and
which
all
your
adversaries
shall
not
be
able
to
gainsay
nor
Luke21:16
And
ye
shall
be
betrayed
both
by
and
and
kinsfolks,
and
and
some
of
you
shall
they
cause
to
b

put
to
Luke21:17
And
ye
shall
be
hated
of
all
men
for
my
name's
Luke21:18
But
there
shall
not
an
hair
of
your
head
Luke21:19
In
your
patience
possess
ye
your
Luke21:20
And
when
ye
shall
see
Jerusalem
compassed
with

know
that
the
desolation
thereof
is
Luke21:21
Then
let
them
which
are
in
Judaea
flee
to
the
and
let
them
which
are
in
the
midst
of
it
depart
and
let
no

them
that
are
in

countries
enter
Luke21:22
For
these
be
the
days
of
that
all
things
which
are
written
may
be
Luke21:23
But
woe
unto
them
that
are
with
and
to
them
that
give
in
those
for
there
shall
be
great
distress
in
th

and
wrath
upon

And
they
shall
fall
by
the
edge
of

and
shall
be
led
away
captive
into
all

Jerusalem
shall
be
trod

And
there

be

Luke21:26
Men's
hearts
failing

for
looking
after
those
things
which
are
coming

powers
of

And
then
shall
they
see
the
Son
of

coming
in
a
cloud
with
power
and
great
Luke21:28
And
when
these
things
begin
to
come
to
then
look
and
lift
up
your
for
your
redemption

Luke21:29
And
he
spake
to
them
a
Behold

all

Luke21:30
When
they
now
shoot
ye
see
and
know
of
your
own
selves
that
summer
is
now
nigh
at
Luke21:31
So
likewise
when
ye
see
these
things
come
to
know
ye
that
the
kingdom
of
God
is
nigh
at
Luke21:32
Verily
I
say
unto
This
generation
shall
not
pass
till
all
be
Luke21:33
Heaven
and
earth
shall
pass
but
my
words
shall
not
pass
Luke21:34
And
take
heed
to
lest
at
any
time
your
hearts
be
overcharged
with
surfeiting,
and
and
cares
of

and
so
that
day
come
upon
you
Luke21:35
For
as
a
snare
shall
it
come
on
all
them
that
dwell
on
the
face
of
the
whole
Luke21:36
Watch
ye
and
pray
that
ye
may
be
accounted
worthy
to
escape
all
these
things
that
shall
come
to
and
to
stand
before
the
Son
of
Luke21:37
And
in
the
day
time
he
was
teaching
in
the
and
at
night
he
went
and
abode
in
the
mount
that
is
called
the
mo
unt
of
Luke21:38
And
all
the
people
came
early
in
the
morning
to
him
in
the
for
to
hear
Luke22:1
Now
the
feast
of
unleavened
bread
drew
which
is
called
the
Luke22:2
And
the
chief
priests
and
scribes
sought
how
they
might
kill
for
they
feared
the
Luke22:3
Then
entered
Satan
into
Judas
surnamed
being
of
the
number
of
the
Luke22:4
And
he
went
his
and
communed
with
the
chief
priests
and
how
he
might
betray
him
unto
Luke22:5
And
they
were
and
covenanted
to
give
him
Luke22:6
And
he
and
sought
opportunity
to
betray
him
unto
them
in
the
absence
of
the
Luke22:7
Then
came
the
day
of
unleavened
when
the
passover
must
be
Luke22:8
And
he
sent
Peter
and
Go
and
prepare
us
the
that
we
may

And
they
said
unto
Where
wilt
thou
that

And
he
said
unto
when
ye
are
entered
into
the
there
shall
a
man
meet
bearing
a
pitcher
of

him
into
the
house
where
he
entereth
Luke22:11
And
ye
shall
say
unto
the
goodman
of
the
The
Master
saith
unto
Where
is
the
guestchamber,
where
I
shall
eat
the
passover
with
my
Luke22:12
And
he
shall
shew
you
a
large
upper
room
there
make
Luke22:13
And
they
and
found
as
he
had
said
unto
and
they
made
ready
the
Luke22:14
And
when
the
hour
was
he
sat
and
the
twelve
apostles
with
Luke22:15
And
he
said
unto
With
desire
I
have
desired
to
eat
this
passover
with
you
before
I
Luke22:16
For
I
say
unto
I
will
not
any
more
eat
until
it
be
fulfilled
in
the
kingdom
of
Luke22:17
And
he
took
the
and
gave
and
Take
and
divide
it
among
Luke22:18
For
I
say
unto
I
will
not
drink
of
the
fruit
of
the
until
the
kingdom
of
God
shall

And
he
took
and
gave

brake
and
gave

This

my
body
which

given
for

Likewise
also

This
cup

the
new
testament
in
my
which
is
shed
for
Luke22:21

hand
of
him
that
betrayeth
me

with
me
on
the

And
truly
the
Son
of
man
goeth,
as
it
was
but
woe
unto
that
man
by
whom
he
is
Luke22:23
And
they
began
to
enquire
among
which
of
them
it
was
that
should
do
this
Luke22:24
And
there
was
also
a
strife
among
which
of
them
should
be
accounted
the
Luke22:25
And
he
said
unto
The
kings
of
the
Gentiles
exercise
lordship
over
and
they
that
exercise
authority
upon
them

called
Luke22:26
But
ye
shall
not
be
but
he
that
is
greatest
among
let
him
be
as
the
and
he
that
is
as
he
that

For
whether
is
he
that
sitteth
at
or
he
that
serveth?
is
not
he
that
sitteth
at
but
I
am
among
you
a

that
serveth.
Luke22:28
Ye
are
they
which
have
continued
with
me
in
my
Luke22:29
And
I
appoint
unto
you
a
as
my
Father
hath
appointed
unto
Luke22:30
That
ye
may
eat
and
drink
at
my
table
in
my
and
sit
on
thrones
judging
the
twelve
tribes
of
Luke22:31
And
the
Lord
Satan
hath
desired
to
have
that
he
may
sift
you
as
Luke22:32
But
I
have
prayed
for
that
thy
faith
fail
and
when
thou
art
strengthen
thy

And
he
said
unto
I
am
ready
to
go
with
both
into
and
to
Luke22:34
And
he
I
tell
the
cock
shall
not
crow

before
that
thou
shalt
thrice
deny
that

knowest

And
he
said
unto
When
I
sent
you
without

lacked

Then
said
he
unto
But

him
take
and
likewise
his
and
he
that
hath
no
sword

let
him
sell
his
and
buy

For
I
say
unto
that
this
that
is
written
must
yet
be
accomplished
in
And
he
was
reckoned
among
the
transgressors
:
for
the
things
concerning

an

And
they
here
are

he
said
unto
It
is

And
he
came
and
as
he
was
to
the
mount
of
and
his
disciples
also
followed
Luke22:40
And
when
he
was
at
the
he
said
unto
Pray
that
ye
enter
not
into

And
he
was
withdrawn
from
them
about
a
stone's
and
kneeled
and

cup
from

And
there
appeared
an
angel
unto
him
from
strengthening
Luke22:44
And
being
in
an
agony
he
prayed
more
and
his
sweat
was
as
it
were
great
drops
of
blood
falling
down
to
the
gro

And
when
he
rose
up
from

was

found
them
sleeping
for

And
said
unto
Why

And
while

was
called

before
and
drew

ear
unto
Jesus
to
kiss

But
Jesus
said
unto
betrayest

Son
of
man

When
they
which
were
about
him
saw
what
would

said
unto
shall
we
smite
with

And
one
of
them
smote
the
servant
of

high

cut
off

Jesus
answered
and
Suffer

touched

said

ye
stretched
forth
no
hands
against
but
this
is
your
and
the
power
of
Luke22:54
Then
took
they
and
led
and
brought
him
into
the
high
priest's
And
Peter
followed
afar
Luke22:55
And
when
they
had
kindled
a
fire
in
the
midst
of
the
and
were
set
down
Peter
sat
down
among
Luke22:56
But
a
certain
maid
beheld
him
as
he
sat
by
the
and
earnestly
looked
upon
and
This
man
was
also
with
Luke22:57
And
he
denied
I
know
him
Luke22:58
And
after
a
little
while
another
saw
and
Thou
art
also
of
And
Peter
I
am
Luke22:59
And
about
the
space
of
one
hour
after
another
confidently
Of
a
truth
this
fellow
also
was
with
for
he
is
a
Galilaean.
Luke22:60
And
Peter
I
know
not
what
thou
sayest.
And
while
he
yet
the
cock
Luke22:61
And
the
Lord
and
looked
upon
And
Peter
remembered
the
word
of
the
how
he
had
said
unto
Before
t
he
cock
thou
shalt
deny
me
Luke22:62
And
Peter
went
and
wept
Luke22:63
And
the
men
that
held
Jesus
mocked
and
smote
Luke22:64
And
when
they
had
blindfolded
they
struck
him
on
the
and
asked
who
is
it
that
smote
the
e?
Luke22:65
And
many
other
things
blasphemously
spake
they
against
Luke22:66
And
as
soon
as
it
was
the
elders
of
the
people
and
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
came
and
led
him
into
their
Luke22:67
Art
thou
the
tell
And
he
said
unto
If
I
tell
ye
will
not
Luke22:68
And
if
I
also
ask
ye
will
not
answer
nor
let
me

Hereafter
shall
the
Son
of
man
sit
on
the
right
hand
of
the
power
of
Luke22:70
Then
said
they
Art
thou
then
the
Son
of
And
he
said
unto
Ye

that

And
they
What
need
we
any
further
for
we
ourselves
have
heard
of
his
own
Luke23:1
And
the
whole
multitude
of
them
and
led
him
unto
Luke23:2
And
they
began
to
accuse
We
found
this
fellow
perverting
the
and
forbidding
to
give
tribute
to
Caesar
,
saying
that
he
himself
is
Christ

Luke23:3
And
Pilate
asked
Art
thou
the
King
of
the
And
he
answered
him
and
Thou
sayest
Luke23:4
Then
said
Pilate
to
the
chief
priests
and
to
the
I
find
no
fault
in
this
Luke23:5
And
they
were
the
more
He
stirreth
up
the
teaching
throughout
all
beginning
from
Galilee
to
this
Luke23:6
When
Pilate
heard
of
he
asked
whether
the
man
were
a
Galilaean.
Luke23:7
And
as
soon
as
he
knew
that
he
belonged
unto
Herod's
he
sent
him
to
who
himself
also
was
at
Jerusalem
at
that
Luke23:8
And
when
Herod
saw
he
was
exceeding
for
he
was
desirous
to
see
him
of
a
long
because
he
had
heard
man
y
things
of
and
he
hoped
to
have
seen
some
miracle
done
by
Luke23:9
Then
he
questioned
with
him
in
many
but
he
answered
him
Luke23:10
And
the
chief
priests
and
scribes
stood
and
vehemently
accused
Luke23:11
And
Herod
with
his
men
of
war
set
him
at
and
mocked
and
arrayed
him
in
a
gorgeous
and
sent
him
again
t
o
Luke23:12
And
the
same
day
Pilate
and
Herod
were
made
friends
for
before
they
were
at
enmity
between
Luke23:13
And
when
he
had
called
together
the
chief
priests
and
the
rulers
and
the
Luke23:14
Said
unto
Ye
have
brought
this
man
unto
as
one
that
perverteth
the
having
examined
him
before
have
found
no
fault
in
this
man
touching
those
things
whereof
ye
accuse
Luke23:15
nor
yet
for
I
sent
you
to
nothing
worthy
of
death
is
done
unto
Luke23:16
I
will
therefore
chastise
and
release
Luke23:17
(For
of
necessity
he
must
release
one
unto
them
at
the
feast.)
Luke23:18
And
they
cried
out
all
at
Away
with
this
and
release
unto
us
Luke23:19
(Who
for
a
certain
sedition
made
in
the
and
for
was
cast
into
prison.)
Luke23:20
Pilate
willing
to
release
spake
again
to
Luke23:21
But
they
Crucify
crucify
Luke23:22
And
he
said
unto
them
the
third
what
evil
hath
he
I
have
found
no
cause
of
death
in

will
therefor

chastise
and
let

And
they
were
instant
with
loud
requiring
that
he
might
be
And
the
voices
of
them
and
of
the
chief
pri

Luke23:24
And
Pilate
gave
sentence
that
it
should
be
as
they
Luke23:25
And
he
released
unto
them
him
that
for
sedition
and
murder
was
cast
into
whom
they
had
but
he
delivered
Jesus
to
their
Luke23:26
And
as
they
led
him
they
laid
hold
upon
one
a
Cyrenian,
coming
out
of
the
and
on
him
they
laid
the
that
he
might
bear
it
after
Luke23:27
And
there
followed
him
a
great
company
of
and
of
which
also
bewailed
and
lamented
Luke23:28
But
Jesus
turning
unto
them
Daughters
of

not
for

weep
for

for
your
children

Luke23:29
the
days

in
the
which
they
shall

and
the
wombs
that

the
paps
which
never

Then
shall
they
begin
to
say
to

Fall
on
and
to

Cover
Luke23:31
For
if
they
do
these
things
in
a
green
what
shall
be
done
in
the
Luke23:32
And
there
were
also
two
led
with
him
to
be
put
to
Luke23:33
And
when
they
were
come
to
the
which
is
called
there
they
crucified
and
the
one
on
the
right
and
the
other
on

Then
said
forgive
for
they
know
not
what

And
they
parted

cast

And
the
people
stood
And
the
rulers
also
with
them
derided
He
saved
let
him
save
if
he
be
the
chosen
of
Luke23:36
And
the
soldiers
also
mocked
coming
to
and
offering
him

And
If
thou
be

king

a
superscription
also
was
written
over
him
in
letters

of

malefactors

were
hanged

But
the
other
answering
rebuked
Dost
not

fear
seeing
thou
art
in

And
we
indeed
for
we
receive
the
due
reward
of
our

this
man
hath
done
nothing
Luke23:42
And
he
said
unto
remember
me
when
thou
comest
into
thy
Luke23:43
And
Jesus
said
unto
Verily
I
say
unto
To
day
shalt
thou
be
with
me
in
Luke23:44
And
it
was
about
the
sixth
and
there
was
a
darkness
over
all
the
earth
until
the
ninth
Luke23:45
And
the
sun
was
and
the
veil
of
the
temple
was
rent
in
the
Luke23:46
And
when
Jesus
had
cried
with
a
loud

into
thy
hands
I
commend
my

having
said
he
gave
up
the
Luke23:47
Now
when
the
centurion
saw
what
was
he
glorified
Certainly
this
was
a
righteous
Luke23:48
And
all
the
people
that
came
together
to
that
beholding
the
things
which
were
smote
their
and
retur
Luke23:49
And
all
his
and
the
women
that
followed
him
from
stood
afar
beholding
these
Luke23:50
there
was
a
man
named
a
and
he
was
a
good
and
a
Luke23:51
(The
same
had
not
consented
to
the
counsel
and
deed
of
them;)
he
was
of
Arimathaea,
a
city
of
the
who
also
himself
waited
for
the
kingdom
of
Luke23:52
This
man
went
unto
and
begged
the
body
of
Luke23:53
And
he
took
it
and
wrapped
it
in
and
laid
it
in
a
sepulchre
that
was
hewn
in
wherein
never
man
before
was
Luke23:54
And
that
day
was
the
and
the
sabbath
drew
Luke23:55
And
the
women
which
came
with
him
from
followed
and
beheld
the
and
how
his
body
was
laid
.
Luke23:56
And
they
and
prepared
spices
and
and
rested
the
sabbath
day
according
to
the
Luke24:1
Now
upon
the
first
day
of
the
very
early
in
the
they
came
unto
the
bringing
the
spices
which
the
y
had
and
certain
others
with
Luke24:2
And
they
found
the
stone
rolled
away
from
the
Luke24:3
And
they
entered
and
found
not
the
body
of
the
Lord
Luke24:4
And
it
came
to
as
they
were
much
perplexed
two
men
stood
by
them
in
shining
Luke24:5
And
as
they
were
and
bowed
down
their
faces
to
the
they
said
unto
Why
seek
ye
the
living
among
the
de
Luke24:6
He
is
not
but
is
remember
how
he
spake
unto
you
when
he
was
yet
in
Luke24:7
The
Son
of
man
must
be
delivered
into
the
hands
of
sinful
and
be
and
the
third
day
rise
Luke24:8
And
they
remembered
his
Luke24:9
And
returned
from
the
and
told
all
these
things
unto
the
and
to
all
the
Luke24:10
It
was
Mary
and
and
Mary
the
mother
of
and
other
women
that
were
with
which
told
these
th
ings
unto
the
Luke24:11
And
their
words
seemed
to
them
as
idle
and
they
believed
them
Luke24:12
Then
arose
and
ran
unto
the
and
stooping
he
beheld
the
linen
clothes
laid
by
and
depa
rted,
wondering
in
himself
at
that
which
was
come
to
Luke24:13
two
of
them
went
that
same
day
to
a
village
called
Emmaus,
which
was
from
Jerusalem
about
threescore
furlong
s.
Luke24:14
And
they
talked
together
of
all
these
things
which
had
Luke24:15
And
it
came
to
while
they
communed
together
and
Jesus
himself
drew
and
went
with
Luke24:16
But
their
eyes
were
holden
that
they
should
not
know
Luke24:17
And
he
said
unto
What
manner
of
communications
are
these
that
ye
have
one
to
as
ye
and
are
Luke24:18
And
the
one
of
whose
name
was
Cleopas,
answering
said
unto
Art
thou
only
a
stranger
in
and
hast
not
known
the
things
which
are
come
to
pass
there
in
these
Luke24:19
And
he
said
unto
What
And
they
said
unto
Concerning
Jesus
of
which
was
a
prophet
mighty
in
d
eed
and
word
before
God
and
all
the
Luke24:20
And
how
the
chief
priests
and
our
rulers
delivered
him
to
be
condemned
to
and
have
crucified
Luke24:21
But
we
trusted
that
it
had
been
he
which
should
have
redeemed
and
beside
all
to
day
is
the
third
day
since
these
things
were
Luke24:22
and
certain
women
also
of
our
company
made
us
which
were
early
at
the
Luke24:23
And
when
they
found
not
his
they
that
they
had
also
seen
a
vision
of
which
said
that
he
was
a
Luke24:24
And
certain
of
them
which
were
with
us
went
to
the
and
found
it
even
so
as
the
women
had
but
him
they
sa
w
Luke24:25
Then
he
said
unto
O
and
slow
of
heart
to
believe
all
that
the
prophets
have
Luke24:26
Ought
not
Christ
to
have
suffered
these
and
to
enter
into
his
Luke24:27
And
beginning
at
Moses
and
all
the
he
expounded
unto
them
in
all
the
scriptures
the
things
concerning
Luke24:28
And
they
drew
nigh
unto
the
whither
they
and
he
made
as
though
he
would
have
gone
Luke24:29
But
they
constrained
Abide
with
for
it
is
toward
and
the
day
is
far
And
he
went
in
to
ta
rry
with
Luke24:30
And
it
came
to
as
he
sat
at
meat
with
he
took
and
blessed
and
and
gave
to
Luke24:31
And
their
eyes
were
and
they
knew
and
he
vanished
out
of
their
Luke24:32
And
they
said
one
to
Did
not
our
heart
burn
within
while
he
talked
with
us
by
the
and
while
he
opened
t
o
us
the
Luke24:33
And
they
rose
up
the
same
and
returned
to
and
found
the
eleven
gathered
and
them
that
were
wit
h
Luke24:34
The
Lord
is
risen
and
hath
appeared
to
Luke24:35
And
they
told
what
things
were
done
in
the
and
how
he
was
known
of
them
in
breaking
of
Luke24:36
And
as
they
thus
Jesus
himself
stood
in
the
midst
of
and
saith
unto
Peace
be
unto
Luke24:37
But
they
were
terrified
and
affrighted,
and
supposed
that
they
had
seen
a
Luke24:38
And
he
said
unto
Why
are
ye
and
why
do
thoughts
arise
in
your
Luke24:39
Behold
my
hands
and
my
that
it
is
I
handle
and
for
a
spirit
hath
not
flesh
and
as
ye
see
me
Luke24:40
And
when
he
had
thus
he
shewed
them
his
hands
and
his
Luke24:41
And
while
they
yet
believed
not
for
and
he
said
unto
Have
ye
here
any

And
they
gave
him
a
piece
of
a
broiled
and
of
an
Luke24:43
And
he
took
and
did
eat
before
Luke24:44
And
he
said
unto
These
are
the
words
which
I
spake
unto
while
I
was
yet
with
that
all
things
must
be
fulf
illed,
which
were
written
in
the
law
of
and
in
the
and
in
the
concerning
Luke24:45
Then
opened
he
their
that
they
might
understand
the
Luke24:46
And
said
unto
Thus
it
is
and
thus
it
behoved
Christ
to
and
to
rise
from
the
dead
the
third
Luke24:47
And
that
repentance
and
remission
of
sins
should
be
preached
in
his
name
among
all
beginning
at
Luke24:48
And
ye
are
witnesses
of
these
Luke24:49
I
send
the
promise
of
my
Father
upon
but
tarry
ye
in
the
city
of
until
ye
be
endued
with
pow

from
on
Luke24:50
And
he
led
them
out
as
far
as
to
and
he
lifted
up
his
and
blessed
Luke24:51
And
it
came
to
while
he
blessed
he
was
parted
from
and
carried
up
into
Luke24:52
And
they
worshipped
and
returned
to
Jerusalem
with
great
Luke24:53
And
were
continually
in
the
praising
and
blessing
John1:1
In
the
beginning
was

and
the
Word
was
with

the

was

The

was
in
the
beginning
with

All
things
were
made
by

without
him
was
not
any
thing
made
that
was

In
him
was

the
life
was
the
light
of

And
the
light
shineth
in
and
the
darkness
comprehended
it
John1:6
There
was
a
man
sent
from
whose
name
was
John1:7
The
same
came
for
a
to
bear
witness
of
the
that
all
men
through
him
might

He
was
not
that
but
was
sent
to
bear
witness
of
that

That
was
the
true
which
lighteth
every
man
that
cometh
into

He
was
in

was
made
by
and
the
world
knew
him
John1:11
He
came
unto
his
and
his
own
received
him
John1:12
But
as
many
as
received
to
them
gave
he
power
to
become
the
sons
of

to
them
that
believe
on

Which
were
not
of

of

of

And
the

was
made

dwelt
among

we
beheld

glory
as
of

only
begotten
of

of

he
was
before
John1:16
And
of
his
fulness
have
all

grace

For
the
law
was
given
by

grace

truth
came
by

John1:18
No
man
hath
seen
God
at
any
the
only
begotten
which
is
in
the
bosom
of
the
he
hath
declared
John1:19
And
this
is
the
record
of
when
the
Jews
sent
priests
and
Levites
from
Jerusalem
to
ask
Who
art
John1:20
And
he
and
denied
but
I
am
not
the
John1:21
And
they
asked
What
Art
thou
And
he
I
am
Art
thou
that
And

Then
said
they
unto
Who
art
that
we
may
give
an
answer
to
them
that
sent

sayest
thou
of

I
am

voice
of
one
crying
in

the
way
of
the
as
said
the
prophet
Esaias.
John1:24
And
they
which
were
sent
were
of
the
Pharisees.
John1:25
And
they
asked
and
said
unto
Why
baptizest
thou
if
thou
be
not
that
nor
neither
that
prophe

John1:26
John
answered
I
baptize
with
but
there
standeth
one
among
whom
ye
know
John1:27
He
it
who
coming
after
me
is
preferred
before
whose
shoe's
latchet
I
am
not
worthy
to
John1:28
These
things
were
done
in
Bethabara
beyond
where
John
was
John1:29
The
next
day
John
seeth
Jesus
coming
unto
and
Behold
the
Lamb
of
which
taketh
away
the
sin
of
the
John1:30
This
is
he
of
whom
I
After
me
cometh
a
man
which
is
preferred
before
for
he
was
before
John1:31
And
I
knew
him
but
that
he
should
be
made
manifest
to
therefore
am
I
come
baptizing
with
John1:32
And
John
bare
I
saw
the
Spirit
descending
from
heaven
like
a

it
abode
upon
John1:33
And
I
knew
him
but
he
that
sent
me
to
baptize
with
the
same
said
unto
Upon
whom
thou
shalt
see
the
Spirit
and
remaining
on
the
same
is
he
which
baptizeth
with
the
Holy

And
I

bare
record
that
this
is
the
Son
of

Again
the
next
day
after
John
and
two
of
his

And
looking
upon
Jesus
as
he
he
Behold
the
Lamb
of

And
the
two
disciples
heard
him
and
they
followed

Then
Jesus
and
saw
them
and
saith
unto

saith
unto

Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
Because
I
said

thou

greater
things

And
he
saith

And
the
third
day
there
was
a
marriage
in

of

When
the
ruler
of

had
tasted

that
was
made

knew
not
whence
it
(but
the
servants
which
dr

knew;)
the
governor
of

feast
called

saith
unto
Every

thou
hast
kept

This
beginning
of
miracles
did
Jesus
in
Cana
of
and
manifested
forth
his
and
his
disciples
believed
on
him
.
John2:12
After
this
he
went
down
to

they
continued
there
no
t
many

And
the
passover
was
at
and
Jesus
went
up
to
John2:14
And
found
in
the
temple
those
that
sold
oxen
and
sheep
and
and
the
changers
of
money
John2:15
And
when
he
had
made
a
scourge
of
small
he
drove
them
all
out
of

overthrew

And
said
unto
them
that

things

Father's
house
an
house
of
John2:17
And
his
disciples
remembered
that
it
was
The
zeal
of
thine
house
hath
eaten
me
John2:18
Then
answered
the
Jews
and
said
unto
What
sign
shewest
thou
unto
seeing
that
thou
doest
these
John2:19
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
Destroy
this
and
in
three
days
I
will
raise
it
John2:20
Then
said
the
Forty
and
six
years
was
this
temple
in
and
wilt
thou
rear
it
up
in
three
John2:21
But
he
spake
of
the
temple
of
his
John2:22
When
therefore
he
was
risen
from
the
his
disciples
remembered
that
he
had
said
this
unto
and
they
believed
the
and
the
word
which
Jesus
had
John2:23
Now
when
he
was
in
Jerusalem
at
the
in
the
feast
many
believed
in
his
when
they
saw
the
miracles
whic

he

But
Jesus
did
not
commit
himself
unto
because
he
knew
all
John2:25
And
needed
not
that
any
should
testify
of
for
he
knew
what
was
in
John3:1
There
was
a
man
of
the
Pharisees,
named
a
ruler
of
the
John3:2
The
same
came
to
Jesus
by
and
said
unto
we
know
that
thou
art
a
teacher
come
from
for
no
man
can
do
these
miracles
that
thou
doest,
except
God
be
with

Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
I
say
unto
Except
a
man
be
born
he
cannot
see
the
kingdom
of
John3:4
Nicodemus
saith
unto
How
can
a
man
be
born

he
enter

I
say
unto
Except

of

That
which

that

born
of

not

The
wind
bloweth
where
it
listeth,
and
thou
hearest

Nicodemus
answered
and
said
unto
How
can

things

Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
Art
thou
a
master
of

knowest
not

I
say
unto
We
speak

If
I
have
told

ye

if
I
tell

John3:13
And
no
man
hath
ascended
up
to
but
he
that
came
down
from
even
the
Son
of
man
which
is
in
John3:14
And
as
Moses
lifted
up
the
serpent
in
the
even
so
must
the
Son
of
man
be
lifted

That
whosoever
believeth
in

should
not
but
have
eternal
John3:16
For
God
so
loved
the
that
he
gave
his
only
begotten
that
whosoever
believeth
in
him
should
not
but
hav

everlasting
John3:17
For
God
sent
not
his
Son
into
the
world
to
condemn
the
but
that
the
world
through
him
might
be
John3:18
He
that
believeth
on
him
is
not
but
he
that
believeth
not
is
condemned
because
he
hath
not
believed
in
the
name
of
the
only
begotten
Son
of
John3:19
And
this
is
the
that
light
is
come
into
the
and
men
loved
darkness
rather
than
because
their
d
eeds
were
John3:20
For
every
one
that
doeth
evil
hateth
the
neither
cometh
to
the
lest
his
deeds
should
be

But
he
that
doeth
truth
cometh
to
the
that
his
deeds
may
be
made
that
they
are
wrought
in
John3:22
After
these
things
came
Jesus
and
his
disciples
into
the
land
of
and
there
he
tarried
with
and
John3:23
And
John
also
was
baptizing
in
Aenon
near
to
Salim,
because
there
was
much
water
and
they
and
were
John3:24
For
John
was
not
yet
cast
into
John3:25
Then
there
arose
a
question
between
some
of
John's
disciples
and
the
Jews
about
John3:26
And
they
came
unto
and
said
unto
he
that
was
with
thee
beyond
to
whom
thou
barest
behol

the
same
baptizeth,
and
all
men
come
to

John
answered
and
A
man
can
receive
except
it
be
given
him
from

Ye
yourselves

And
what
he
hath
seen
and
that

testifieth;
and
no

receiveth

John3:33
He
that
hath
received
his
testimony
hath
set
to
his
seal
that
God
is

For
he
whom
God
hath

He
that

John4:1
When
therefore
the
LORD
knew
how
the
Pharisees
had
heard
that
Jesus
made
and
baptized
more
disciples
than
John4:2
(Though
Jesus
himself
baptized
but
his
disciples,)
John4:3
He
left
and
departed
again
into
John4:4
And
he
must
needs
go
through
John4:5
Then
cometh
he
to
a
city
of
which
is
called
Sychar,
near
to
the
parcel
of
ground
that
Jacob
gave
to
his
son
Joseph
.
John4:6
Now
Jacob's
well
was

being
wearied

There
cometh
a
woman
of
Samaria
to

saith
unto
Give
me

John4:8
(For
his
disciples
were
gone
away
unto
the
city
to
buy
meat.)
John4:9
Then
saith
the
woman
of
Samaria
unto
How
is
it
that
being
a
askest
drink
of
which
am

woman
of
Samaria
?
for
the
Jews
have
no
dealings
with
the
Samaritans.
John4:10
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
If
thou
knewest
the
gift
of

who
it
is
that
saith
to
Give

asked

would
have
given
thee

saith
unto
thou

John4:13
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
Whosoever
drinketh
of
this
water
shall
thirst
John4:14
But
whosoever
drinketh
of
the
water
that
I
shall

water
that
I
shall
give

The

saith
unto

that

Jesus
saith
unto

The
woman
answered
and
I
have

said

Thou

have
no

For
thou
hast
had
five

thou
now

saith
unto

saith
unto

Ye

we
know

is
of

But
the
hour
and
now
when
the
true
worshippers
shall
worship

in
spirit
and
in

the
Father
seeketh
such
to

God
is

they
that
worship
him
must
worship
him

The
woman
saith
unto
I
know
that
Messias
which
is
called

will

Jesus
saith
unto
I
that

And
upon
this
came
his
and
marvelled
that
he
talked
with
the
yet
no
man
What
seekest
Why
talkest
thou
with
John4:28
The
woman
then
left
her
waterpot,
and
went
her
way
into
the
and
saith
to
the
John4:29
see
a
which
told
me
all
things
that
ever
I
is
not
this
the
John4:30
Then
they
went
out
of
the
and
came
unto
John4:31
In
the
mean
while
his
disciples
prayed
John4:32
But
he
said
unto
I
have
meat
to
eat
that
ye
know
not
John4:33
Therefore
said
the
disciples
one
to
Hath
any
man
brought
him
ought
to
John4:34
Jesus
saith
unto
My
meat
is
to
do
the
will
of
him
that
sent
and
to
finish
his
John4:35
Say
not
There
are
yet
four
and
then
cometh
I
say
unto
Lift
up
your

look
on

they
are
white
already
to

And
he
that
reapeth

gathereth
fruit
unto

that
both

that
soweth

he
that
reapeth

rejoice
John4:37
And
herein
is
that
saying
One
soweth,
and
another
reapeth.
John4:38
I
sent
you
to
reap
that
whereon
ye
bestowed
no
other
men
and
ye
are
entered
into
their
John4:39
And
many
of
the
Samaritans
of
that
city
believed
on
him
for
the
saying
of
the
which
He
told
me
all
that

So
when
the
Samaritans
were
come

they
besought
him
that
he
would
tarry
with
and
he
abode
there
two
John4:41
And
many
more
believed
because
of
his
own
John4:42
And
said
unto
the
Now
we
not
because
of
thy
for
we
have
heard
him
and
know
that
this
is
indeed
the
the
Saviour
of
the
John4:43
Now
after
two
days
he
departed
and
went
into
John4:44
For
Jesus
himself
that
a
prophet
hath
no
honour
in
his
own
John4:45
Then
when
he
was
come
into
the
Galilaeans
received
having
seen
all
the
things
that
he
did
at
Jerusalem
at
th
e
for
they
also
went
unto
the
John4:46
So
Jesus
came
again
into
Cana
of
where
he
made
the
water
And
there
was
a
certain
whose
son
was
si
ck
at
John4:47
When
he
heard
that
Jesus
was
come
out
of
Judaea
into
he
went
unto
and
besought
him
that
he
would
come
and
heal
his
for
he
was
at
the
point
of
John4:48
Then
said
Jesus
unto
Except
ye
see
signs
and
ye
will
not
John4:49
The
nobleman
saith
unto
come
down
ere
my
child
John4:50
Jesus
saith
unto
Go
thy
thy
son
And
the
man
believed
the
word
that
Jesus
had
spoken
unto
and
he
wen
t
his
John4:51
And
as
he
was
now
going
his
servants
met
and
told
Thy
son
John4:52
Then
enquired
he
of
them
the
hour
when
he
began
to
And
they
said
unto
Yesterday
at
the
seventh
hour
the
fever
left
John4:53
So
the
father
knew
that
it
was
at
the
same
in
the
which
Jesus
said
unto
Thy
son
and
himself
a
nd
his
whole
John4:54
This
is
again
the
second
miracle
that
Jesus
when
he
was
come
out
of
Judaea
into
John5:1
After
this
there
was
a
feast
of
the
and
Jesus
went
up
to
John5:2
Now
there
is
at
Jerusalem
by
the
sheep
market
a
which
is
called
in
the
Hebrew
tongue
having
five
John5:3
In
these
lay
a
great
multitude
of
impotent
of
waiting
for
the
moving
of
the
John5:4
For
an
angel
went
down
at
a
certain
season
into
the
and
troubled
the
whosoever
then
first
after
the
troubling
of
the
water
stepped
in
was
made
whole
of
whatsoever
disease
he
John5:5
And
a
certain
man
was
which
had
an
infirmity
thirty
and
eight
John5:6
When
Jesus
saw
him
and
knew
that
he
had
been
now
a
long
time
in
that
he
saith
unto
Wilt
thou
be
made
John5:7
The
impotent
man
answered
I
have
no
when
the
water
is
to
put
me
into
the
but
while
I
am
comi
ng,
another
steppeth
down
before
John5:8
Jesus
saith
unto
take
up
thy
and
John5:9
And
immediately
the
man
was
made
and
took
up
his
and
and
on
the
same
day
was
the
John5:10
The
Jews
therefore
said
unto
him
that
was
It
is
the
sabbath
it
is
not
lawful
for
thee
to
carry
thy
John5:11
He
answered
He
that
made
me
the
same
said
unto
Take
up
thy
and
John5:12
Then
asked
they
What
man
is
that
which
said
unto
Take
up
thy
and
John5:13
And
he
that
was
healed
wist
not
who
it
for
Jesus
had
conveyed
himself
a
multitude
being
in
that
John5:14
Afterward
Jesus
findeth
him
in
the
and
said
unto
thou
art
made
sin
no
lest
a
worse
thing
come
unto
John5:15
The
man
and
told
the
Jews
that
it
was
which
had
made
him
John5:16
And
therefore
did
the
Jews
persecute
and
sought
to
slay
because
he
had
done
these
things
on
the
sabbath
John5:17
But
Jesus
answered
My
Father
worketh
and
I
John5:18
Therefore
the
Jews
sought
the
more
to
kill
because
he
not
only
had
broken
the
but
said
also
that
God
was
his
making
himself
equal
with
John5:19
Then
answered
Jesus
and
said
unto
I
say
unto
The
Son
can
do
nothing
of
but
what
he
see
th
the
Father
for
what
things
soever
he
doeth,
these
also
doeth
the
Son
John5:20
For
the
Father
loveth
the
and
sheweth
him
all
things
that
himself
doeth:
and
he
will
shew
him
greater
works
than
thes
e,
that
ye
may
John5:21
For
as
the
Father
raiseth
up
the
and
quickeneth
even
so
the
Son
quickeneth
whom
he
John5:22
For
the
Father
judgeth
no
but
hath
committed
all
judgment
unto
the
John5:23
That
all
men
should
honour
the
even
as
they
honour
the
He
that
honoureth
not
the
Son
honoureth
not
the
Father
which
hath
sent
John5:24
I
say
unto
He
that
heareth
my
and
believeth
on
him
that
sent
hath
everlasting
and
sha
ll
not
come
into
but
is
passed
from
death
unto
John5:25
I
say
unto
The
hour
is
and
now
when
the
dead
shall
hear
the
voice
of
the
Son
of
and
they
that
hear
shall
John5:26
For
as
the
Father
hath
life
in
so
hath
he
given
to
the
Son
to
have
life
in
John5:27
And
hath
given
him
authority
to
execute
judgment
because
he
is
the
Son
of
John5:28
Marvel
not
at
for
the
hour
is
in
the
which
all
that
are
in
the
graves
shall
hear
his
John5:29
And
shall
come
they
that
have
done
unto
the
resurrection
of
and
they
that
have
done
unto
the
resu
rrection
of
John5:30
I
can
of
mine
own
self
do
as
I
I
and
my
judgment
is
because
I
seek
not
mine
own
but
the
will
of
the
Father
which
hath
sent
John5:31
If
I
bear
witness
of
my
witness
is
not
John5:32
There
is
another
that
beareth
witness
of
and
I
know
that
the
witness
which
he
witnesseth
of
me
is
John5:33
Ye
sent
unto

he
bare
witness
unto
the
John5:34
But
I
receive
not
testimony
from
but
these
things
I
that
ye
might
be
John5:35
He
was
a
burning
and
a
shining
and
ye
were
willing
for
a
season
to
rejoice
in
his
John5:36
But
I
have
greater
witness
than
that
of
for
the
works
which
the
Father
hath
given
me
to
the
same
works
that
I
bear
witness
of
that
the
Father
hath
sent
John5:37
And
the
Father
which
hath
sent
hath
borne
witness
of
Ye
have
neither
heard
his
voice
at
any
nor
see

his

And
ye
have
not
his
word

he
hath

Search
the

and
they
are
they
which
testify
of
John5:40
And
ye
will
not
come
to
that
ye
might
have
John5:41
I
receive
not
honour
from
John5:42
But
I
know
that
ye
have
not
the
love
of
God
in

How
can
ye

of

seek
not
the
honour
that
cometh
from
God
John5:45
Do
not

After
these
things
Jesus
went
over
the
sea
of
which
is
the
sea
of
John6:2
And
a
great
multitude
followed
because
they
saw
his
miracles
which
he
did
on
them
that
were

And
Jesus
went
up
into

there

sat
with

When
Jesus
then
lifted

saw

company
come

unto

And
this
he
said
to
prove

himself
knew

he
would

answered
Two

were

said
unto

when

And
when

it

So
when
they
had
rowed
about

drawing
nigh
unto

they
were

But
he
saith
unto
It

Then
they
willingly
received
him
into

immediately
the

was
at
the
land
whither
they
John6:22
The
day
when
the
people
which
stood
on
the
other
side
of
the
sea
saw
that
there
was
none
other
boat
save
that
one
whereinto
his
disciples
were

that
Jesus
went
not

that

(Howbeit
there
came
other
boats
from
Tiberias

also
took

came
to

when

had
found

on

other
side
of

said
unto
when
camest
thou
John6:26
Jesus
answered
them
and
I
say
unto
Ye

Then
said
they
unto
What
shall

that
we
might
work

works
of

Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
This
is
the
work
of

believe
on

They
said
therefore
unto

John6:31
Our
fathers
did
eat
manna
in
the
as
it
is
He
gave
them
bread
from
heaven
to
John6:32
Then
Jesus
said
unto
I
say
unto
Moses
gave
you
not
that
bread
from
but
my
Father
giveth
you
the
true
bread
from

For
the
bread
of
God
is
he
which
cometh
down
from

giveth
life
unto

John6:34
Then
said
they
unto

give
us
this

And
Jesus
said
unto
I

of

that

he
that
believeth
on
me

But
I
said
unto
That
ye
also
have
seen

believe
John6:37
All
that
the
Father
giveth
me
shall
come
to

him
that
cometh
to
me
I
will
in
no
wise
cast

For
I
came
down
from
not
to
do
mine
own
but
the
will
of
him
that
sent
John6:39
And
this
is
the
Father's
will
which
hath
sent
that
of
all
which
he
hath
given
me
I
should
lose

should

up

And
this
is
the
will
of
him
that

The
Jews
then
murmured
at
because
he
I
am
the
bread
which
came
down
from
John6:42
And
they
Is
not
this
the
son
of
whose
father
and
mother

how
is
it
then
that
he
I
came
down
from

Jesus
therefore
answered
and
said
unto
Murmur

No

The
Jews
therefore
strove
among
How
can
this
man
give
us
his
flesh
to
John6:53
Then
Jesus
said
unto
I
say
unto
Except

have
no

He

drinketh
my

I
in

As
the
living
Father
hath
sent

I
live
by

so
he
that

This
is
that
bread
which
came
down
from

your
fathers
did
eat

These
things
said
he
in
the
as
he
taught
in
John6:60
Many
therefore
of
his
when
they
had
heard
This
is
an
hard
who
can
hear
John6:61
When
Jesus
knew
in
himself
that
his
disciples
murmured
at

said
unto
Doth
this
offend

What
and
if
ye
shall
see
the
Son
of

up

he
was
John6:63
It
is
the
spirit
that
quickeneth;
the
flesh
profiteth
the
words
that
I
speak
unto
they
are
and
they
are
John6:64
But
there
are
some
of
you
that
believe
For
Jesus
knew
from
the
beginning
who
they
were
that
believed
and
who
sho

he
Therefore
said
I
unto

From
that
time
many
of
his
disciples
went
and
walked
no
more
with
John6:67
Then
said
Jesus
unto
the
Will
ye
also

Then
Simon
Peter
answered
to

John7:1
After
these
things
Jesus
walked
in
for
he
would
not
walk
in
because
the
Jews
sought
to
kill
John7:2
Now
the
feast
of
tabernacles
was
at
John7:3
His
brethren
therefore
said
unto
Depart
and
go
into
that
thy
disciples
also
may
see
the
works
that
thou
doest.
John7:4
For
there
is
no
man
that
doeth
any
thing
in
and
he
himself
seeketh
to
be
known
If
thou
do
these
she
w
thyself
to
the
John7:5
For
neither
did
his
brethren
believe
in
John7:6
Then
Jesus
said
unto
My
time
is
not
yet
but
your
time
is
alway
John7:7
The
world
cannot
hate
but
me
it
hateth,
because
I
testify
of
that
the
works
thereof
are
John7:8
Go
ye
up
unto
this
I
go
not
up
yet
unto
this
for
my
time
is
not
yet
full
John7:9
When
he
had
said
these
words
unto
he
abode
still
in
John7:10
But
when
his
brethren
were
gone
then
went
he
also
up
unto
the
not
but
as
it
were
in
John7:11
Then
the
Jews
sought
him
at
the
and
Where
is
John7:12
And
there
was
much
murmuring
among
the
people
concerning
for
some
He
is
a
good
others
but
he
de
ceiveth
the
John7:13
Howbeit
no
man
spake
openly
of
him
for
fear
of
the
John7:14
Now
about
the
midst
of
the
feast
Jesus
went
up
into
the
and
John7:15
And
the
Jews
How
knoweth
this
man
having
never
John7:16
Jesus
answered
and
My
doctrine
is
not
but
his
that
sent
John7:17
If
any
man
will
do
his
he
shall
know
of
the
whether
it
be
of
or
whether
I
speak
of
John7:18
He
that
speaketh
of
himself
seeketh
his
own
but
he
that
seeketh
his
glory
that
sent
the
same
is
and
no
u
nrighteousness
is
in
John7:19
Did
not
Moses
give
you
the
and
yet
none
of
you
keepeth
the
Why
go
ye
about
to
kill
John7:20
The
people
answered
and
Thou
hast
a
who
goeth
about
to
kill
John7:21
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
I
have
done
one
and
ye
all
John7:22
Moses
therefore
gave
unto
you
(not
because
it
is
of
but
of
the
fathers;)
and
ye
on
the
sabbath
day
ci
rcumcise
a
John7:23
If
a
man
on
the
sabbath
day
receive
that
the
law
of
Moses
should
not
be
are
ye
angry
at
because
I
have
made
a
man
every
whit
whole
on
the
sabbath
John7:24
Judge
not
according
to
the
but
judge
righteous
John7:25
Then
said
some
of
them
of
Is
not
this
whom
they
seek
to
John7:26
he
speaketh
and
they
say
nothing
unto
Do
the
rulers
know
indeed
that
this
is
the
very
John7:27
Howbeit
we
know
this
man
whence
he
but
when
Christ
no
man
knoweth
whence
he
John7:28
Then
cried
Jesus
in
the
temple
as
he
Ye
both
know
and
ye
know
whence
I
and
I
am
not
come
of
myself
,
but
he
that
sent
me
is
whom
ye
know
John7:29
But
I
know
for
I
am
from
and
he
hath
sent
John7:30
Then
they
sought
to
take
but
no
man
laid
hands
on
because
his
hour
was
not
yet
John7:31
And
many
of
the
people
believed
on
and
When
Christ
will
he
do
more
miracles
than
these
which
this
man
h
ath
John7:32
The
Pharisees
heard
that
the
people
murmured
such
things
concerning
and
the
Pharisees
and
the
chief
priests
sent
offi
cers
to
take
John7:33
Then
said
Jesus
unto
Yet
a
little
while
am
I
with
and
then
I
go
unto
him
that
sent
John7:34
Ye
shall
seek
and
shall
not
find
and
where
I
thither
ye
cannot
John7:35
Then
said
the
Jews
among
Whither
will
he
that
we
shall
not
find
will
he
go
unto
the
dispersed
among
t
he
and
teach
the
John7:36
What
manner
of
saying
is
this
that
he
Ye
shall
seek
and
shall
not
find
and
where
I
thither
ye
cannot
com
e?
John7:37
In
the
last
that
great
day
of
the
Jesus
stood
and
If
any
man
let
him
come
unto
and
John7:38
He
that
believeth
on
as
the
scripture
hath
out
of
his
belly
shall
flow
rivers
of
living
John7:39
(But
this
spake
he
of
the
which
they
that
believe
on
him
should
for
the
Holy
Ghost
was
not
yet
bec
ause
that
Jesus
was
not
yet
glorified.)
John7:40
Many
of
the
people
when
they
heard
this
Of
a
truth
this
is
the
John7:41
Others
This
is
the
But
some
Shall
Christ
come
out
of
John7:42
Hath
not
the
scripture
That
Christ
cometh
of
the
seed
of
and
out
of
the
town
of
where
David
John7:43
So
there
was
a
division
among
the
people
because
of
John7:44
And
some
of
them
would
have
taken
but
no
man
laid
hands
on
John7:45
Then
came
the
officers
to
the
chief
priests
and
Pharisees;
and
they
said
unto
Why
have
ye
not
brought
John7:46
The
officers
Never
man
spake
like
this
John7:47
Then
answered
them
the
Pharisees,
Are
ye
also
John7:48
Have
any
of
the
rulers
or
of
the
Pharisees
believed
on
John7:49
But
this
people
who
knoweth
not
the
law
are
John7:50
Nicodemus
saith
unto
(he
that
came
to
Jesus
by
being
one
of
them,)
John7:51
Doth
our
law
judge
any
before
it
hear
and
know
what
he
doeth?
John7:52
They
answered
and
said
unto
Art
thou
also
of
and
for
out
of
Galilee
ariseth
no
John7:53
And
every
man
went
unto
his
own
John8:1
Jesus
went
unto
the
mount
of
John8:2
And
early
in
the
morning
he
came
again
into
the
and
all
the
people
came
unto
and
he
sat
and
taught
John8:3
And
the
scribes
and
Pharisees
brought
unto
him
a
woman
taken
in
and
when
they
had
set
her
in
the
John8:4
They
say
unto
this
woman
was
taken
in
in
the
very
John8:5
Now
Moses
in
the
law
commanded
that
such
should
be
but
what
sayest
John8:6
This
they
tempting
that
they
might
have
to
accuse
But
Jesus
stooped
and
with
his
finger
wrote
on
the
as
though
he
heard
them
John8:7
So
when
they
continued
asking
he
lifted
up
and
said
unto
He
that
is
without
sin
among
let
him
firs
t
cast
a
stone
at
John8:8
And
again
he
stooped
and
wrote
on
the
John8:9
And
they
which
heard
being
convicted
by
their
own
went
out
one
by
beginning
at
the
even
unto
t
he
and
Jesus
was
left
and
the
woman
standing
in
the
John8:10
When
Jesus
had
lifted
up
and
saw
none
but
the
he
said
unto
where
are
those
thine
hat
h
no
man
condemned
John8:11
She
No
And
Jesus
said
unto
Neither
do
I
condemn
and
sin
no
John8:12
Then
spake
Jesus
again
unto
I
am
the
light
of
the
he
that
followeth
me
shall
not
walk
in
bu
t
shall
have
the
light
of
John8:13
The
Pharisees
therefore
said
unto
Thou
bearest
record
of
thy
record
is
not
John8:14
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
Though
I
bear
record
of
yet
my
record
is
for
I
know
whence
I
and
wh
ither
I
but
ye
cannot
tell
whence
I
and
whither
I
John8:15
Ye
judge
after
the
I
judge
no
John8:16
And
yet
if
I
my
judgment
is
for
I
am
not
but
I
and
the
Father
that
sent
John8:17
It
is
also
written
in
your
that
the
testimony
of
two
men
is
John8:18
I
am
one
that
bear
witness
of
and
the
Father
that
sent
me
beareth
witness
of
John8:19
Then
said
they
unto
Where
is
thy
Jesus
Ye
neither
know
nor
my
if
ye
had
known
ye
sh
ould
have
known
my
Father
John8:20
These
words
spake
Jesus
in
the
as
he
taught
in
the
and
no
man
laid
hands
on
for
his
hour
was
not
ye
t
John8:21
Then
said
Jesus
again
unto
I
go
my
and
ye
shall
seek
and
shall
die
in
your
whither
I
ye
cannot
co
John8:22
Then
said
the
Will
he
kill
because
he
Whither
I
ye
cannot
John8:23
And
he
said
unto
Ye
are
from
I
am
from
ye
are
of
this
I
am
not
of
this
John8:24
I
said
therefore
unto
that
ye
shall
die
in
your
for
if
ye
believe
not
that
I
am
ye
shall
die
in
your
John8:25
Then
said
they
unto
Who
art
And
Jesus
saith
unto
Even
the
same
that
I
said
unto
you
from
the
John8:26
I
have
many
things
to
say
and
to
judge
of
but
he
that
sent
me
is
and
I
speak
to
the
world
those
things
which
I
have
heard
of
John8:27
They
understood
not
that
he
spake
to
them
of
the
John8:28
Then
said
Jesus
unto
When
ye
have
lifted
up
the
Son
of
then
shall
ye
know
that
I
am
and
that
I
do
nothing
o
f
but
as
my
Father
hath
taught
I
speak
these
John8:29
And
he
that
sent
me
is
with
the
Father
hath
not
left
me
for
I
do
always
those
things
that
please
John8:30
As
he
spake
these
many
believed
on
John8:31
Then
said
Jesus
to
those
Jews
which
believed
on
If
ye
continue
in
my
then
are
ye
my
disciples
John8:32
And
ye
shall
know
the
and
the
truth
shall
make
you
John8:33
They
answered
We
be
Abraham's
and
were
never
in
bondage
to
any
how
sayest
Ye
shall
be
made
John8:34
Jesus
answered
I
say
unto
Whosoever
committeth
sin
is
the
servant
of
John8:35
And
the
servant
abideth
not
in
the
house
for
but
the
Son
abideth
John8:36
If
the
Son
therefore
shall
make
you
ye
shall
be
free
John8:37
I
know
that
ye
are
Abraham's
but
ye
seek
to
kill
because
my
word
hath
no
place
in
John8:38
I
speak
that
which
I
have
seen
with
my
and
ye
do
that
which
ye
have
seen
with
your
John8:39
They
answered
and
said
unto
Abraham
is
our
Jesus
saith
unto
If
ye
were
Abraham's
ye
would
do
the
works
of
John8:40
But
now
ye
seek
to
kill
a
man
that
hath
told
you
the
which
I
have
heard
of
this
did
not
John8:41
Ye
do
the
deeds
of
your
Then
said
they
to
We

not

Jesus
said
unto
If

forth
and
came
from

came

Why
do
ye
not
understand
my

because
ye
cannot
hear

John8:44
Ye
are
of
your
father
the
and
the
lusts
of
your
father

He
was
a
murderer
from
the
and
abode
not
in
the
because
there
is
no
truth
in
When
he
speaketh
a

speaketh
of

he
is

the
fathe

of

And
because
I
tell
you

believe

John8:46
Which
of
you
convinceth
me
of
And
if
I
say
the
why
do
ye
not
believe
John8:47
He
that

of
God
heareth
God's
ye
therefore
hear
them
because
ye
are
not

Then
answered
the
and
said
unto
Say

Jesus
I
have

I
honour

ye
do
dishonour

And
I
seek
not
mine

is
one
that
seeketh
and
judgeth.
John8:51
I
say
unto
If
a
man
keep

he
shall
never
see

Then
said
the
Jews
unto
Now
we
know
that
thou

and
thou
sayest,
If
a
man

Art

Yet
ye
have

John8:56
Your
father
Abraham
rejoiced
to
see
my
and
he
saw
and
was
John8:57
Then
said
the
Jews
unto
Thou
art
not
yet
fifty
years
and
hast
thou
seen
John8:58
Jesus
said
unto
I
say
unto
Before
Abraham

John8:59
Then
took
they
up
stones
to
cast
at
but
Jesus
hid
and
went
out
of
the
going
through
the
midst
of
the
m,
and
so
passed
John9:1
And
as
Jesus
passed
he
saw
a
man
which
was
blind
from
his
John9:2
And
his
disciples
asked
who
did
this
or
his
that
he
was
born
John9:3
Jesus
Neither
hath
this
man
nor
his
but
that
the
works
of
God
should
be
made
manifest
in
John9:4
I
must
work
the
works
of
him
that
sent
while
it
is
the
night
when
no
man
can
John9:5
As
long
as
I
am
in
the
I
am
the
light
of
the
John9:6
When
he
had
thus
he
spat
on
the
and
made
clay
of
the
and
he
anointed
the
eyes
of
the
blind
man
wit
h
the
John9:7
And
said
unto
wash
in
the
pool
of
(which
is
by
Sent.)
He
went
his
way
and
washe
d,
and
came
John9:8
The
neighbours
and
they
which
before
had
seen
him
that
he
was
Is
not
this
he
that
sat
and
John9:9
Some
This
is
others
He
is
like
but
he
I
am
John9:10
Therefore
said
they
unto
How
were
thine
eyes
John9:11
He
answered
and
A
man
that
is
called
Jesus
made
and
anointed
mine
and
said
unto
Go
to
the
pool
of
Si
and
and
I
went
and
and
I
received
John9:12
Then
said
they
unto
Where
is
He
I
know
John9:13
They
brought
to
the
Pharisees
him
that
aforetime
was
John9:14
And
it
was
the
sabbath
day
when
Jesus
made
the
and
opened
his
John9:15
Then
again
the
Pharisees
also
asked
him
how
he
had
received
his
He
said
unto
He
put
clay
upon
mine
and
I
and
do
John9:16
Therefore
said
some
of
the
Pharisees,
This
man
is
not
of
because
he
keepeth
not
the
sabbath
Others
How
can
a
man
that
is
a
sinner
do
such
And
there
was
a
division
among
John9:17
They
say
unto
the
blind
man
What
sayest
thou
of
that
he
hath
opened
thine
He
He
is
a
John9:18
But
the
Jews
did
not
believe
concerning
that
he
had
been
and
received
his
until
they
called
the
parents
of
him
that
had
received
his
John9:19
And
they
asked
Is
this
your
who
ye
say
was
born
how
then
doth
he
now
John9:20
His
parents
answered
them
and
We
know
that
this
is
our
and
that
he
was
born
John9:21
But
by
what
means
he
now
seeth,
we
know
or
who
hath
opened
his
we
know
he
is
of
ask
he
shall
spe
ak
for
John9:22
These
words
spake
his
because
they
feared
the
for
the
Jews
had
agreed
that
if
any
man
did
confess
that
he
was
he
should
be
put
out
of
the
John9:23
Therefore
said
his
He
is
of
ask
John9:24
Then
again
called
they
the
man
that
was
and
said
unto
Give
God
the
we
know
that
this
man
is
a
John9:25
He
answered
and
Whether
he
be
a
sinner
or
I
know
one
thing
I
whereas
I
was

John9:26
Then
said
they
to
him
What
did
he
to
how
opened
he
thine
John9:27
He
answered
I
have
told
you
and
ye
did
not
wherefore
would
ye
hear
it
will
ye
also
be
his
disc
iples?
John9:28
Then
they
reviled
and
Thou
art
his
but
we
are
John9:29
We
know
that
God
spake
unto
as
for
this
we
know
not
from
whence
he
John9:30
The
man
answered
and
said
unto
Why
herein
is
a
marvellous
that
ye
know
not
from
whence
he
and
yet
he
hath
opened
mine
John9:31
Now
we
know
that
God
heareth
not
but
if
any
man
be
a
worshipper
of
and
doeth
his
him
he
heareth.
John9:32
Since
the
world
began
was
it
not
heard
that
any
man
opened
the
eyes
of
one
that
was
born
John9:33
If
this
man
were
not
of
he
could
do
John9:34
They
answered
and
said
unto
Thou
wast
altogether
born
in
and
dost
thou
teach
And
they
cast
him
John9:35
Jesus
heard
that
they
had
cast
him
and
when
he
had
found
he
said
unto
Dost
thou
believe
on
the
Son
of
John9:36
He
answered
and
Who
is
that
I
might
believe
on
John9:37
And
Jesus
said
unto
Thou
hast
both
seen
and
it
is
he
that
talketh
with
John9:38
And
he
I
And
he
worshipped
John9:39
And
Jesus
For
judgment
I
am
come
into
this
that
they
which
see
not
might
and
that
they
which
see
might
b

made
John9:40
And
some
of
the
Pharisees
which
were
with
him
heard
these
and
said
unto
Are
we
blind
John9:41
Jesus
said
unto
If
ye
were
ye
should
have
no
but
now
ye
We
therefore
your

remaineth.
John10:1
I

unto
He

But
he
that
entereth
in

the
door
is
the
shepherd
of
the
John10:3
To
him
the
porter
openeth;
and
the
sheep
hear
his
and
he
calleth
his
own
sheep
by
and
leadeth
them
John10:4
And
when
he
putteth
forth
his
own
he
goeth
before
and
the
sheep
follow
for
they
know
his
John10:5
And
a
stranger
will
they
not
but
will
flee
from
for
they
know
not
the
voice
of
John10:6
This
parable
spake
Jesus
unto
but
they
understood
not
what
things
they
were
which
he
spake
unto
John10:7
Then
said
Jesus
unto
them
I
say
unto
I
am
the
door
of
the
John10:8
All
that
ever
came
before
me
are
thieves
and
but
the

did
not

I
am

if
any
man
enter
he
shall
be
and
shall
go
in
and
and
find
John10:10
The
thief
cometh
but
for
to

to
and
to
I
am
come
that
they
might

that
they

John10:11
I
am

But
he
that

wolf
and
leaveth

and

and
the
wolf
catcheth
and
scattereth

The
hireling
fleeth,
because
he
is
an

careth
not
for

I
am
the
good

know

of

As
the
Father
knoweth
even
so

And

they

John10:17
Therefore
doth
my
Father
love
because
I
lay
down

I
might
take

John10:18
No
man
taketh
it

I

Th

have
I
received
of

John10:19
There
was
a
division
therefore
again
among
the
Jews
for
these
John10:20
And
many
of
them
He
hath
a

is
why

These

And
it
was
at
Jerusalem
the
feast
of
the
and
it
was
John10:23
And
Jesus
walked
in
the
temple
in
Solomon's
John10:24
Then
came
the
Jews
round
about
and
said
unto
How
long
dost
thou
make
us
to
If

John10:25
Jesus
answered
I
told
and
ye
believed
the
works
that
I
do
in
my
Father's
they
bear
witness
of
John10:26
But
ye
believe
because
ye
are
not
of
my
as
I
said
unto
John10:27
My
sheep
hear
my
and
I
know
and
they
follow
John10:28
And
I
give
unto
them

they
shall
never
neither
shall
any
man
pluck
them
out
of
my
John10:29
My
which
gave
them
is
greater
than

no
man
is
able
to
pluck
them
out
of
my
Father's
John10:30
I
and
my
Father
are
John10:31
Then
the
Jews
took
up
stones
again
to
stone
John10:32
Jesus
answered
Many
good
works
have
I
shewed
you
from
my
for
which
of
those
works
do
ye
stone
John10:33
The
Jews
answered
For
a
good
work
we
stone
thee
but
for
and
because
that
being
a
makest

John10:34
Jesus
answered
Is
it
not
written
in
your

Ye
are
John10:35
If
he
called
them
unto
whom
the
word
of
God
and
the
scripture
cannot
be
John10:36
Say
ye
of
whom
the
Father
hath

But
if
I
though
ye
believe
not
believe
the
that
ye
may
and
that
the
Father
is
in
and
I
in
John10:39
Therefore
they
sought
again
to
take
but
he
escaped
out
of
their
John10:40
And
went
away
again
beyond
Jordan
into
the
place
where
John
at
first
and
there
he
John10:41
And
many
resorted
unto
and
John
did
no
but
all
things
that
John
spake
of
this
man
were
John10:42
And
many
believed
on
him
John11:1
Now
a
certain
man
was
named
of
the
town
of
Mary
and
her
sister
John11:2
(It
was
that
Mary
which
anointed
the
Lord
with
and
wiped
his
feet
with
her
whose
brother
Lazarus
was
)
John11:3
Therefore
his
sisters
sent
unto
he
whom
thou
lovest
is
John11:4
When
Jesus
heard
he
This
sickness
is
not
unto
but
for
the
glory
of
that
the
Son
of
God
might
be
gl
orified
John11:5
Now
Jesus
loved
and
her
and
John11:6
When
he
had
heard
therefore
that
he
was
he
abode
two
days
still
in
the
same
place
where
he
John11:7
Then
after
that
saith
he
to
his
Let
us
go
into
Judaea
John11:8
His
disciples
say
unto
the
Jews
of
late
sought
to
stone
and
goest
thou
thither
John11:9
Jesus
Are
there
not
twelve
hours
in
the
If
any
man
walk
in
the
he
stumbleth
because
he
seeth
the
light
of
this
John11:10
But
if
a
man
walk
in
the
he
stumbleth,
because
there
is
no
light
in
John11:11
These
things
said
and
after
that
he
saith
unto
Our
friend
Lazarus
sleepeth;
but
I
that
I
may
awake
him
out
of
John11:12
Then
said
his
if
he
he
shall
do
John11:13
Howbeit
Jesus
spake
of
his
but
they
thought
that
he
had
spoken
of
taking
of
rest
in
John11:14
Then
said
Jesus
unto
them
Lazarus
is
John11:15
And
I
am
glad
for
your
sakes
that
I
was
not
to
the
intent
ye
may
nevertheless
let
us
go
unto
John11:16
Then
said
which
is
called
Didymus,
unto
his
fellowdisciples,
Let
us
also
that
we
may
die
with
John11:17
Then
when
Jesus
he
found
that
he
had
lain
in
the
grave
four
days
John11:18
Now
Bethany
was
nigh
unto
about
fifteen
furlongs
John11:19
And
many
of
the
Jews
came
to
Martha
and
to
comfort
them
concerning
their
John11:20
Then
as
soon
as
she
heard
that
Jesus
was
went
and
met
but
Mary
sat
still
in
the
John11:21
Then
said
Martha
unto
if
thou
hadst
been
my
brother
had
not
John11:22
But
I
that
even
whatsoever
thou
wilt
ask
of
God
will
give
it
John11:23
Jesus
saith
unto
Thy
brother
shall
rise
John11:24
Martha
saith
unto
I
know
that
he
shall
rise
again
in
the
resurrection
at
the
last
John11:25
Jesus
said
unto
I
am
the
and
the
he
that
believeth
in
though
he
were
yet
shall
he
live
:
John11:26
And
whosoever
liveth
and
believeth
in
me
shall
never
Believest
thou
John11:27
She
saith
unto
I
believe
that
thou
art
the
the
Son
of
which
should
come
into
the
John11:28
And
when
she
had
so
she
went
her
and
called
Mary
her
sister
The
Master
is
and
calleth
for
John11:29
As
soon
as
she
heard
she
arose
and
came
unto
John11:30
Now
Jesus
was
not
yet
come
into
the
but
was
in
that
place
where
Martha
met
John11:31
The
Jews
then
which
were
with
her
in
the
and
comforted
when
they
saw
that
she
rose
up
hastily
and
went
followed
She
goeth
unto
the
grave
to
weep
John11:32
Then
when
Mary
was
come
where
Jesus
and
saw
she
fell
down
at
his
saying
unto
if
thou
hadst
bee
n
my
brother
had
not
John11:33
When
Jesus
therefore
saw
her
and
the
Jews
also
weeping
which
came
with
he
groaned
in
the
and
was
tr
oubled,
John11:34
And
Where
have
ye
laid
They
said
unto
come
and
John11:35
Jesus
John11:36
Then
said
the
Behold
how
he
loved
John11:37
And
some
of
them
Could
not
this
which
opened
the
eyes
of
the
have
caused
that
even
this
man
should
not
have
John11:38
Jesus
therefore
again
groaning
in
himself
cometh
to
the
It
was
a
and
a
stone
lay
upon
John11:39
Jesus
Take
ye
away
the
the
sister
of
him
that
was
saith
unto
by
this
time
he
stinke
for
he
hath
been
dead
four
John11:40
Jesus
saith
unto
Said
I
not
unto
if
thou
wouldest
thou
shouldest
see
the
glory
of
John11:41
Then
they
took
away
the
stone
from
the
place
where
the
dead
was
And
Jesus
lifted
up
his
and
I
t
hank
thee
that
thou
hast
heard
John11:42
And
I
knew
that
thou
hearest
me
but
because
of
the
people
which
stand
by
I
said
that
they
may
believe
that
th
ou
hast
sent
John11:43
And
when
he
thus
had
he
cried
with
a
loud
come
John11:44
And
he
that
was
dead
came
bound
hand
and
foot
with
graveclothes:
and
his
face
was
bound
about
with
a
Jesus
saith
unto
Loose
and
let
him
John11:45
Then
many
of
the
Jews
which
came
to
and
had
seen
the
things
which
Jesus
believed
on
John11:46
But
some
of
them
went
their
ways
to
the
Pharisees,
and
told
them
what
things
Jesus
had
John11:47
Then
gathered
the
chief
priests
and
the
Pharisees
a
and
What
do
for
this
man
doeth
many
John11:48
If
we
let
him
thus
all
men
will
believe
on
and
the
Romans
shall
come
and
take
away
both
our
place
and
John11:49
And
one
of
named
being
the
high
priest
that
same
said
unto
Ye
know
nothing
at
John11:50
Nor
consider
that
it
is
expedient
for
that
one
man
should
die
for
the
and
that
the
whole
nation
perish
John11:51
And
this
spake
he
not
of
but
being
high
priest
that
he
prophesied
that
Jesus
should
die
for
that
John11:52
And
not
for
that
nation
but
that
also
he
should
gather
together
in
one
the
children
of
God
that
were
scattered
abro
John11:53
Then
from
that
day
forth
they
took
counsel
together
for
to
put
him
to
John11:54
Jesus
therefore
walked
no
more
openly
among
the
but
went
thence
unto
a
country
near
to
the
into
a
city
called
and
there
continued
with
his
John11:55
And
the
passover
was
nigh
at
and
many
went
out
of
the
country
up
to
Jerusalem
before
the
to
purify
John11:56
Then
sought
they
for
and
spake
among
as
they
stood
in
the
What
think
that
he
will
not
come
to
the
John11:57
Now
both
the
chief
priests
and
the
Pharisees
had
given
a
if
any
man
knew
where
he
he
should
shew
that
they
might
take
John12:1
Then
Jesus
six
days
before
the
passover
came
to
where
Lazarus
which
had
been
whom
he
raised
from
the
d
ead.
John12:2
There
they
made
him
a
and
Martha
but
Lazarus
was
one
of
them
that
sat
at
the
table
with
John12:3
Then
took
Mary
a
pound
of
ointment
of
very
and
anointed
the
feet
of
and
wiped
his
feet
with
her
and
the
house
was
filled
with
the
odour
of
the
John12:4
Then
saith
one
of
his
Judas
Simon's
which
should
betray
John12:5
Why
was
not
this
ointment
sold
for
three
hundred
and
given
to
the
John12:6
This
he
not
that
he
cared
for
the
but
because
he
was
a
and
had
the
and
bare
what
was
put
John12:7
Then
said
Let
her
against
the
day
of
my
burying
hath
she
kept
John12:8
For
the
poor
always
ye
have
with
but
me
ye
have
not
John12:9
Much
people
of
the
Jews
therefore
knew
that
he
was
and
they
came
not
for
sake
but
that
they
might
see
Lazarus
whom
he
had
raised
from
the
John12:10
But
the
chief
priests
consulted
that
they
might
put
Lazarus
also
to
John12:11
Because
that
by
reason
of
him
many
of
the
Jews
went
and
believed
on
John12:12
On
the
next
day
much
people
that
were
come
to
the
when
they
heard
that
Jesus
was
coming
to
John12:13
Took
branches
of
palm
and
went
forth
to
meet
and
Blessed
is
the
King
of
Israel
that
cometh
in
the
name
of
the
John12:14
And
when
he
had
found
a
young
sat
as
it
is
John12:15
Fear
daughter
of
thy
King
sitting
on
an
ass's
John12:16
These
things
understood
not
his
disciples
at
the
but
when
Jesus
was
then
remembered
they
that
these
thi
ngs
were
written
of
and
that
they
had
done
these
things
unto
John12:17
The
people
therefore
that
was
with
him
when
he
called
Lazarus
out
of
his
and
raised
him
from
the
bare
record
.
John12:18
For
this
cause
the
people
also
met
for
that
they
heard
that
he
had
done
this
John12:19
The
Pharisees
therefore
said
among
Perceive
ye
how
ye
prevail
the
world
is
gone
after
John12:20
And
there
were
certain
Greeks
among
them
that
came
up
to
worship
at
the
John12:21
The
same
came
therefore
to
which
was
of
Bethsaida
of
and
desired
we
would
see
John12:22
Philip
cometh
and
telleth
and
again
Andrew
and
Philip
tell
John12:23
And
Jesus
answered
The
hour
is
that
the
Son
of
man
should
be
John12:24
I
say
unto
Except
a
corn
of
wheat
fall
into
the
ground
and
it
abideth
but
if
it
it
bringeth
forth
much
John12:25
He
that
loveth
his
life
shall
lose
and
he
that

John12:26
If
any
man
serve
let
him
follow
and
where
I
there
shall
also
my
servant

any
man
serve

Father
John12:27
Now
is
my
soul
and
what
shall
I
save
me
from
this
but
for
this
cause
came
I
unto
this
John12:28
glorify

Then
came
there
a
voice
from
I

John12:29
The
people
that
stood
and
heard
said
that

others
An
angel
spake
to
John12:30
Jesus
answered
and
This
voice
came
not
because
of
but
for
your
John12:31
Now
is
the
judgment
of
this
now
shall
the
prince
of
this
world
be
cast
John12:32
And
if
I
be
lifted
up
from
the
will
draw
all
men
unto
John12:33
This
he
signifying
what
death
he
should
John12:34
The
people
answered
We
have
heard
out
of
the
law
that
Christ
abideth
for
and
how
sayest
The
Son
of
man
m
ust
be
lifted
who
is
this
Son
of
John12:35
Then
Jesus
said
unto
Yet
a
little
while
is
the
light
with
Walk
while
ye
have
the
lest
darkness
come
upo
n
for
he
that
walketh
in
darkness
knoweth
not
whither
he
goeth.
John12:36
While
ye
have
believe
in
the
that
ye
may
be
the
children
of
These
things
spake
and
and
did
hide
himself
from
John12:37
But
though
he
had
done
so
many
miracles
before
yet
they
believed
not
on
John12:38
That
the
saying
of
Esaias
the
prophet
might
be
which
he
who
hath
believed
our
and
to
whom
hath
the
arm
of
the
Lord
been
John12:39
Therefore
they
could
not
because
that
Esaias
said
John12:40
He
hath
blinded
their
and
hardened
their
that
they
should
not
see
with
their
nor
understand
with
their
and
be
and
I
should
heal
John12:41
These
things
said
Esaias,
when
he
saw
his
and
spake
of
John12:42
Nevertheless
among
the
chief
rulers
also
many
believed
on
but
because
of
the
Pharisees
they
did
not
confess
les
t
they
should
be
put
out
of
the
John12:43
For
they
loved
the
praise
of
men
more
than
the
praise
of
John12:44
Jesus
cried
and
He
that
believeth
on
believeth
not
on
but
on
him
that
sent
John12:45
And
he
that
seeth
me
seeth
him
that
sent
John12:46
I
am
come
a
light
into
the
that
whosoever
believeth
on
me
should
not
abide
in
John12:47
And
if
any
man
hear
my
and
believe
I
judge
him
for
I
came
not
to
judge
the
but
to
save
the
John12:48
He
that
rejecteth
and
receiveth
not
my
hath
one
that
judgeth
the
word
that
I
have
the
same
shall
judge
him
in
the
last
John12:49
For
I
have
not
spoken
of
but
the
Father
which
sent
he
gave
me
a
what
I
should
and
what
I
sh
ould
John12:50
And
I
know
that
his
commandment
is
life
whatsoever
I
speak
even
as
the
Father
said
unto
so
I
John13:1
Now
before
the
feast
of
the
when
Jesus
knew
that
his
hour
was
come
that
he
should
depart
out
of
this
world
unto
the
having
loved
his
own
which
were
in
the
he
loved
them
unto
the
John13:2
And
supper
being
the
devil
having
now
put
into
the
heart
of
Judas
Simon's
to
betray
John13:3
Jesus
knowing
that
the
Father
had
given
all
things
into
his
and
that
he
was
come
from
and
went
to
John13:4
He
riseth
from
and
laid
aside
his
and
took
a
and
girded
John13:5
After
that
he
poureth
water
into
a
bason,
and
began
to
wash
the
and
to
wipe
them
with
the
towel
wherewith
he
was
John13:6
Then
cometh
he
to
Simon
and
Peter
saith
unto
dost
thou
wash
my
John13:7
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
What
I
do
thou
knowest
not
but
thou
shalt
know
John13:8
Peter
saith
unto
Thou
shalt
never
wash
my
Jesus
answered
If
I
wash
thee
thou
hast
no
part
with
John13:9
Simon
Peter
saith
unto
not
my
feet
but
also
my
hands
and
my
John13:10
Jesus
saith
to
He
that
is
washed
needeth
not
save
to
wash
his
but
is
clean
every
and
ye
are
but
n
ot
John13:11
For
he
knew
who
should
betray
therefore
said
Ye
are
not
all
John13:12
So
after
he
had
washed
their
and
had
taken
his
and
was
set
down
he
said
unto
Know
ye
what
I
have
done
to
John13:13
Ye
call
me
Master
and
and
ye
say
for
so
I
John13:14
If
I
your
Lord
and
have
washed
your
ye
also
ought
to
wash
one
another's
John13:15
For
I
have
given
you
an
that
ye
should
do
as
I
have
done
to
John13:16
I
say
unto
The
servant
is
not
greater
than
his
neither
he
that
is
sent
greater
than
he
that
se
nt
John13:17
If
ye
know
these
happy
are
ye
if
ye
do
John13:18
I
speak
not
of
you
I
know
whom
I
have
but
that
the
scripture
may
be
He
that
eateth
bread
with
me
hath
lifted
up
his
heel
against
John13:19
Now
I
tell
you
before
it
when
it
is
come
to
ye
may
believe
that
I
am
John13:20
I
say
unto
He
that
receiveth
whomsoever
I
send
receiveth
and
he
that
receiveth
me
receiveth
him
that
sent
John13:21
When
Jesus
had
thus
he
was
troubled
in
and
and
I
say
unto
that
one
of
you
shall
betray
John13:22
Then
the
disciples
looked
one
on
doubting
of
whom
he
John13:23
Now
there
was
leaning
on
bosom
one
of
his
whom
Jesus
John13:24
Simon
Peter
therefore
beckoned
to
that
he
should
ask
who
it
should
be
of
whom
he
John13:25
He
then
lying
on
breast
saith
unto
who
is
John13:26
Jesus
He
it
to
whom
I
shall
give
a
when
I
have
dipped
And
when
he
had
dipped
the
he
gave
it
t
o
Judas
the
son
of
John13:27
And
after
the
sop
Satan
entered
into
Then
said
Jesus
unto
That
thou
doest,
do
John13:28
Now
no
man
at
the
table
knew
for
what
intent
he
spake
this
unto
John13:29
For
some
of
them
because
Judas
had
the
that
Jesus
had
said
unto
Buy
those
things
that
we
have
need
of
against
the
that
he
should
give
something
to
the
John13:30
He
then
having
received
the
sop
went
immediately
and
it
was
John13:31
when
he
was
gone
Jesus
Now
is
the
Son
of
man
and
God
is
glorified
in
John13:32
If
God
be
glorified
in
God
shall
also
glorify
him
in
and
shall
straightway
glorify
John13:33
Little
yet
a
little
while
I
am
with
Ye
shall
seek
and
as
I
said
unto
the
Whither
I
ye
cannot
so
now
I
say
to
John13:34
A
new
commandment
I
give
unto
That
ye
love
one
as
I
have
loved
that
ye
also
love
one
John13:35
By
this
shall
all
men
know
that
ye
are
my
if
ye
have
love
one
to
John13:36
Simon
Peter
said
unto
whither
goest
Jesus
answered
Whither
I
thou
canst
not
follow
me
but
thou
shalt
follow
me
John13:37
Peter
said
unto
why
cannot
I
follow
thee
I
will
lay
down
my
life
for
thy
John13:38
Jesus
answered
Wilt
thou
lay
down
thy
life
for
my
I
say
unto
The
cock
shall
not
ti
ll
thou
hast
denied
me
John14:1
Let
not
your
heart
be
ye
believe
in
believe
also
in
John14:2
In
my
Father's
house
are
many
if
it
were
not
I
would
have
told
I
go
to
prepare
a
place
for
John14:3
And
if
I
go
and
prepare
a
place
for
I
will
come
and
receive
you
unto
that
where
I
there
ye
may
be
John14:4
And
whither
I
go
ye
and
the
way
ye
John14:5
Thomas
saith
unto
we
know
not
whither
thou
goest;
and
how
can
we
know
the
John14:6
Jesus
saith
unto
I
am
the
the
and
the
no
man
cometh
unto
the
but
by
John14:7
If
ye
had
known
ye
should
have
known
my
Father
and
from
henceforth
ye
know
and
have
seen
John14:8
Philip
saith
unto
shew
us
the
and
it
sufficeth
John14:9
Jesus
saith
unto
Have
I
been
so
long
time
with
and
yet
hast
thou
not
known
he
that
hath
seen
me
hath
seen
the
and
how
sayest
thou
Shew
us
the
John14:10
Believest
thou
not
that
I
am
in
the
and
the
Father
in
the
words
that
I
speak
unto
you
I
speak
not
of
but
the
Father
that
dwelleth
in
he
doeth
the
John14:11
Believe
me
that
I
am
in
the
and
the
Father
in
or
else
believe
me
for
the
very
John14:12
I
say
unto
He
that
believeth
on
the
works
that
I
do
shall
he
do
and
greater
works
than
the
se
shall
he
because
I
go
unto
my
John14:13
And
whatsoever
ye
shall
ask
in
my
that
will
I
that
the
Father
may
be
glorified
in
the
John14:14
If
ye
shall
ask
any
thing
in
my
I
will
do
John14:15
If
ye
love
keep
my
John14:16
And
I
will
pray
the
and
he
shall
give
you
another
that
he
may
abide
with
you
for
John14:17
Even
the
Spirit
of
whom
the
world
cannot
because
it
seeth
him
neither
knoweth
but
ye
know
for
he
dwelleth
with
and
shall
be
in
John14:18
I
will
not
leave
you
I
will
come
to
John14:19
Yet
a
little
and
the
world
seeth
me
no
but
ye
see
because
I
ye
shall
live
John14:20
At
that
day
ye
shall
know
that
I
am
in
my
and
ye
in
and
I
in
John14:21
He
that
hath
my
and
keepeth
he
it
is
that
loveth
and
he
that
loveth
me
shall
be
loved
of
my
Fathe
r,
and
I
will
love
and
will
manifest
myself
to
John14:22
Judas
saith
unto
not
how
is
it
that
thou
wilt
manifest
thyself
unto
and
not
unto
the
John14:23
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
If
a
man
love
he
will
keep
my
and
my
Father
will
love
and
we
will
come
unto
and
make
our
abode
with
John14:24
He
that
loveth
me
not
keepeth
not
my
and
the
word
which
ye
hear
is
not
but
the
Father's
which
sent
John14:25
These
things
have
I
spoken
unto
being
yet
present
with
John14:26
But
the
which
is
the
Holy
whom
the
Father
will
send
in
my
he
shall
teach
you
all
and
brin
g
all
things
to
your
whatsoever
I
have
said
unto
John14:27
Peace
I
leave
with
my
peace
I
give
unto
not
as
the
world
give
I
unto
Let
not
your
heart
be
trouble
d,
neither
let
it
be
John14:28
Ye
have
heard
how
I
said
unto
I
go
and
come
again
unto
If
ye
loved
ye
would
because
I
I
go
unto
the
for
my
Father
is
greater
than
John14:29
And
now
I
have
told
you
before
it
come
to
when
it
is
come
to
ye
might
John14:30
Hereafter
I
will
not
talk
much
with
for
the
prince
of
this
world
and
hath
nothing
in
John14:31
But
that
the
world
may
know
that
I
love
the
and
as
the
Father
gave
me
even
so
I
let
us
go
John15:1
I
am
the
true
and
my
Father
is
the
John15:2
Every
branch
in
me
that
beareth
not
fruit
he
taketh
and
every
branch
that
beareth
he
purgeth
that
it
may
bring
forth
more
John15:3
Now
ye
are
clean
through
the
word
which
I
have
spoken
unto
John15:4
Abide
in
and
I
in
As
the
branch
cannot
bear
fruit
of
except
it
abide
in
the
no
more
can
except
ye
abide
in
John15:5
I
am
the
ye
are
the
He
that
abideth
in
and
I
in
the
same
bringeth
forth
much
for
without
m
e
ye
can
do
John15:6
If
a
man
abide
not
in
he
is
cast
forth
as
a
and
is
and
men
gather
and
cast
them
into
the
and
they
are
John15:7
If
ye
abide
in
and
my
words
abide
in
ye
shall
ask
what
ye
and
it
shall
be
done
unto
John15:8
Herein
is
my
Father
that
ye
bear
much
so
shall
ye
be
my
John15:9
As
the
Father
hath
loved
so
have
I
loved
continue
ye
in
my
John15:10
If
ye
keep
my
ye
shall
abide
in
my
even
as
I
have
kept
my
Father's
and
abide
in
his
lov
e.
John15:11
These
things
have
I
spoken
unto
that
my
joy
might
remain
in
and
that
your
joy
might
be
John15:12
This
is
my
That
ye
love
one
as
I
have
loved
John15:13
Greater
love
hath
no
man
than
that
a
man
lay
down
his
life
for
his
John15:14
Ye
are
my
if
ye
do
whatsoever
I
command
John15:15
Henceforth
I
call
you
not
for
the
servant
knoweth
not
what
his
lord
doeth:
but
I
have
called
you
for
a
ll
things
that
I
have
heard
of
my
Father
I
have
made
known
unto
John15:16
Ye
have
not
chosen
but
I
have
chosen
and
ordained
that
ye
should
go
and
bring
forth
and
that
your
fr
uit
should
that
whatsoever
ye
shall
ask
of
the
Father
in
my
he
may
give
it
John15:17
These
things
I
command
that
ye
love
one
John15:18
If
the
world
hate
ye
know
that
it
hated
me
before
it
hated
John15:19
If
ye
were
of
the
the
world
would
love
his
but
because
ye
are
not
of
the
but
I
have
chosen
you
out
of
the
therefore
the
world
hateth
John15:20
Remember
the
word
that
I
said
unto
The
servant
is
not
greater
than
his
If
they
have
persecuted
they
will
a
lso
persecute
if
they
have
kept
my
they
will
keep
yours
John15:21
But
all
these
things
will
they
do
unto
you
for
my
name's
because
they
know
not
him
that
sent
John15:22
If
I
had
not
come
and
spoken
unto
they
had
not
had
but
now
they
have
no
cloak
for
their
John15:23
He
that
hateth
me
hateth
my
Father
John15:24
If
I
had
not
done
among
them
the
works
which
none
other
man
they
had
not
had
but
now
have
they
both
seen
and
ha
ted
both
me
and
my
John15:25
But
this
cometh
to
that
the
word
might
be
fulfilled
that
is
written
in
their
They
hated
me
without
a
John15:26
But
when
the
Comforter
is
whom
I
will
send
unto
you
from
the
even
the
Spirit
of
which
proceedeth
fro
m
the
he
shall
testify
of
John15:27
And
ye
also
shall
bear
because
ye
have
been
with
me
from
the
John16:1
These
things
have
I
spoken
unto
that
ye
should
not
be
John16:2
They
shall
put
you
out
of
the
the
time
that
whosoever
killeth
you
will
think
that
he
doeth
God
se
rvice.
John16:3
And
these
things
will
they
do
unto
because
they
have
not
known
the
nor
John16:4
But
these
things
have
I
told
that
when
the
time
shall
ye
may
remember
that
I
told
you
of
And
these
things
I
said
not
unto
you
at
the
because
I
was
with
John16:5
But
now
I
go
my
way
to
him
that
sent
and
none

But
because
I

Nevertheless
I
tell

the
It
is
expedient
for
you
that
I
go

if
I

not
the
Comforter
will
not

if

send
him
unto
John16:8
And
when
he
is
he
will
reprove
the
world
of

of

of
John16:9
Of
because
they
believe
not
on
John16:10
Of
because
I
go
to
my

ye
see
me
no
John16:11
Of
because
the
prince
of
this
world
is
John16:12
I
have
yet
many
things
to
say
unto
but
ye
cannot
bear
them
John16:13
Howbeit
when
the
Spirit
of

he
will
guide
you

He
shall
glorify

All
things
that
the
Father
hath

therefore
said
that

A

because
I
go
to

Then
said
some
of
his
disciples
among
What
is
this
that
he
saith
unto
A

and
ye
shall
not

Because
I
go

They
said
What
is
this
that

A

cannot
tell

John16:19
Now
Jesus
knew
that
they
were
desirous
to
ask

said
unto
Do

enquire

A

I
say
unto
That

now
therefore

And
in

Whatsoever
ye
shall

the
Father

Hitherto
have
ye
asked
nothing
in

ye
shall
that
your

may

These
things
have
I
spoken
unto

the
time
when
I

At

For

His
disciples
said
unto
now
speakest

speakest
no
John16:30
Now
are
we
sure
that
thou
knowest
all
and
needest
not
that
any
man
should
ask
by
this
we
believe
that
thou
camest
forth
from

Jesus
answered
Do

the
hour
is
now
that
ye
shall
be
every

and
shall
leave

These
things
I
have
spoken
unto

In

These
words

lifted
up
his
eyes

the
hour
is
glorify
thy
that
thy
S

also
may
glorify
John17:2
As
thou
hast
given
him
power
over
all
that
he
should
give
eternal
life
to
as
many
as
thou
hast
given
John17:3
And
this
is
life
that
they
might
know
thee
the
only
true

Jesus
whom
thou

John17:4
I
have
glorified
thee
on

I
have
finished
the
work
which
thou
gavest
me
to
John17:5
And
O
glorify
thou
me
with
thine
own
self
with
the
glory
which
I
had
with
thee
before
the
world
John17:6
I
have
manifested
thy
name
unto
the
men
which
thou
gavest
me
out
of
the
thine

thou
gavest

have
kept

Now
they
have
known
that
all
things
whatsoever
thou
hast
given
me
are
of
John17:8
For
I
have
given
unto
them
the
words
which
thou
gavest
and
they
have
received
and
have
known
surely
that
I
came
out
from

they
have
believed
that
thou
didst
send

I
pray

pray
not

for

And
all
mine

I
am

And
now
I
am
no
more

these
are
in

I
come
to
Holy
keep
through
thine

those

thou
hast

While
I
was
with

kept

none
of

the
son
of

might

And
now
come
I
to

these
things
I
speak
in

that
they
might
have
my
joy
fulfilled
in
John17:14
I
have
given
them
thy

world
hath
hated
because
they
are
not
of

as
I
am
not
of

John17:15
I
pray
not
that
thou
shouldest
take
them
out
of
the
but
that
thou
shouldest
keep
them
from
the
John17:16
They
are
not
of

even
as
I
am
not

Sanctify
them
through

As
thou
hast
sent
me
into

even
so
have
I
also
sent
them
into

John17:19
And
for
their
sakes
I
sanctify
that
they
also
might
be
sanctified
through

John17:20
Neither
pray
I
for
these
but
for
them
also
which
shall
believe
on

That
they
all
may
be

in

the
world
may
believe
that
thou

And
the
glory
which
thou
gavest

I
have
given
that
they
may
be

that
the
world
may
know

I
will
that

O
righteous

when
Simon

that

naked,)

This
is
now
the
third
time
that
Jesus
shewed
himself

that

from

And
with
many
other
words
did

testify

gladly

And
they
continued
stedfastly
in

in
breaking

in

fear
came
upon

were
done
by

that
believed

And
continuing
daily
with
one

in

Now
Peter
and
John
went
up
together
into

temple
at
the
hour
of
being

ninth

And
a
certain
man
lame
from
his
mother's
womb
was
whom
they
laid
daily
at
the
gate
of
the
temple
which
is
called
B

to
ask
alms

that
entered
into

fastening
his

upon

with

And
he
gave
heed
unto
expecting
to

of

Then

And
he

up

entered
with
them
into

And
all
the
people
saw
him
walking

praising
Acts3:10
And
they
knew
that
it
was
he
which
sat
for
alms
at
the
Beautiful
gate
of
the
and
they
were
filled
with
wonder
and
amazement
at
that
which
had
happened
unto
Acts3:11
And
as
the
lame
man
which
was
healed
held
Peter
and
all
the
people
ran
together
unto
them
in
the
porch
that
is

Solomon's,
greatly
Acts3:12
And
when
Peter
saw

answered
unto
the
Ye

of
why
marvel
ye
at

why
look
ye
so
earnestly
o

as
though
by
our
own
power
or
holiness
we
had
made
this
man
to
Acts3:13
The
God
of

of

of
the
God
of
our

glorified
his
Son
whom
ye
delivered
up

and
denied
him
in
the
presence
of

he
was
determined
to
let
him

But
ye
denied

Holy
One
and
the

desired
a
murderer
to
be
granted
unto
Acts3:15
And
killed
the
Prince
of
whom
God
hath
raised
from
the
whereof
we
are
Acts3:16
And
his
name
through
faith
in
his
name
hath
made
this
man
whom
ye
see

the
faith
which
is
by
him

h
given
him
this
perfect
soundness
in
the
presence
of
you

And
I
wot
that
through
ignorance
ye
did
as
did
also

But
those
which
God
before
had
shewed
by
the
mouth
of
all
his

so
fulf

Acts3:19
Repent
ye
and
be
that
your
sins
may
be
blotted
when
the
times
of
refreshing
shall
come
from

presence
of

Acts3:20
And
he
shall
send
Jesus
which
before
was
preached
unto
Acts3:21
Whom
the

must
receive
until
the
times
of
restitution
of
all
which
God
hath
spoken
by
the
mouth
of
all
his

prophets
since

For
Moses
truly
said
unto

you
of

whatsoever
he
shall
say
unto
Acts3:23
And
it
shall
come
to
that
every
which
will
not
hear
that
shall
be
destroyed
from

and
all

those
that
follow

many
as
have

likewise
foretold
of

Ye

Acts4:1
And
as
they
spake
unto
the
the
and
the
captain
of
the
and
the
Sadducees,
came
upon
Acts4:2
Being
grieved
that
they
taught
the
and
preached
through
Jesus
the
resurrection
from
the
Acts4:3
And
they
laid
hands
on
and
put
them
in
hold
unto
the
next
for
it
was
now
Acts4:4
Howbeit
many
of
them
which
heard
the
word
and
the
number
of
the
men
was
about
five
Acts4:5
And
it
came
to
pass
on
the
that
their
and
and
Acts4:6
And
Annas
the
high
and
and
and
and
as
many
as
were
of
the
kindred
of
the
high
we
re
gathered
together
at
Acts4:7
And
when
they
had
set
them
in
the
they
By
what
or
by
what
have
ye
done
Acts4:8
Then
filled
with
the
Holy
said
unto
Ye
rulers
of

and
elders
of
Acts4:9
If
we
this
day
be
examined
of
the
good
deed
done
to
the
impotent

what

he
is
made
Acts4:10
Be
it
known
unto
you
and
to
all
the
people
of

by

name
of
Jesus
Christ
of
whom
ye
crucified
,
whom
God
raised
from

by
him
doth
this
man
stand
here
before
you
Acts4:11
This
is
the
stone
which
was
set
at
nought
of
you
which
is
become

of

Neither
is
there
salvation
in
any
for
there
is
none
other
name
under

given
among
whereby
we
must
be
sav
Acts4:13
Now
when
they
saw
the
boldness
of
Peter
and
and
perceived
that
they
were
unlearned
and
ignorant
they
and
they
took
knowledge
of
that
they
had
been
with
Acts4:14
And
beholding
the
man
which
was
healed
standing
with
they
could
say
nothing
against
Acts4:15
But
when
they
had
commanded
them
to
go
aside
out
of
the
they
conferred
among
Acts4:16
What
shall
we
do
to
these
for
that
indeed
a
notable
miracle
hath
been
done
by
them
is
manifest
to
all
them

at

in
and
we
cannot
deny
Acts4:17
But
that
it
spread
no
further
among
the

us
straitly
threaten
that
they
speak
henceforth
to
no
man
in
thi
s
Acts4:18
And
they
called
and
commanded
them
not
to
speak
at
all
nor
teach
in
the
name
of
Acts4:19
But
Peter
and
John
answered
and
said
unto
Whether
it
be
right
in
the
sight
of
God
to
hearken
unto
you
more
than
unto
judge
Acts4:20
For
we
cannot
but
speak
the
things
which
we
have
seen
and
Acts4:21
So
when
they
had
further
threatened
they
let
them
finding
nothing
how
they
might
punish
because
of
the
peo
ple:
for
all
men
glorified
God
for
that
which
was
Acts4:22
For
the
man
was
above
forty
years
on
whom
this
miracle
of
healing
was
shewed.
Acts4:23
And
being
let
they
went
to
their
own
and
reported
all
that
the
chief
priests
and
elders
had
said
unto
Acts4:24
And
when
they
heard
they
lifted
up
their
voice
to
God
with
one
and
thou
art
which
hast
made
and
and
the

all
that

The
kings

For
of
a

grant
unto
thy

By
stretching
forth
thine
hand
to

that

And
when
they
had
the
place

shaken
where
they
were
assembled
and
they
were
all
filled
with
the
Holy
and
they
spake
the
word
of
God
with
Acts4:32
And
the
multitude
of
them
that
believed
were
of
one
heart
and
of
one
neither
said
any
of
them
that
ought
of
the
thin
gs
which
he
possessed
was
his
but
they
had
all
things
Acts4:33
And
with
great
power
gave
the
apostles
witness
of
the
resurrection
of
the
Lord
and
great
grace
was
upon
them
Acts4:34
Neither
was
there
any
among
them
that
for
as
many
as
were
possessors
of
lands

prices

And
Ananias
hearing

words
fell

gave
up

great
fear
came
on
all
them
that
heard

the
young

wound

buried

And
it
was
about

of
three
hours
when

And
Peter
answered
unto

Peter
said

yielded
up

the
young

found

great
fear
came
upon

Insomuch

they
brought
forth

laid
them
on

that
at
the

all
they

sect
of

were
filled

brought
them
without

they
feared
the
lest
they
should

ave
been
Acts5:27
And
when
they
had
brought
they
set
them
before
the
and
the
high
priest
asked
Acts5:28
Did
not
we
straitly
command
you
that
ye
should
not
teach
in
this
ye
have
filled
Jerusalem
with
your
and
intend
to
bring
this
man's
blood
upon
Acts5:29
Then
Peter
and
the
other
apostles
answered
and
We
ought
to
obey
God
rather
than
Acts5:30
The
God
of
our
fathers
raised
up
whom
ye
slew
and
hanged
on
a
Acts5:31
Him
hath
God
exalted
with
his
right
hand
to
be
a
Prince
and
a
for
to
give
repentance
to
and
forgiveness
o

Acts5:32
And
we
are
his
witnesses
of
these
and
so
is
also
the
Holy
whom
God
hath
given
to
them
that
obey
Acts5:33
When
they
heard
they
were
cut
to
the
and
took
counsel
to
slay
Acts5:34
Then
stood
there
up
one
in
the
a
named
Gamaliel,
a
doctor
of
the
had
in
reputation
among
all
the
p
eople,
and
commanded
to
put
the
apostles
forth
a
little
Acts5:35
And
said
unto
Ye
men
of
take
heed
to
yourselves
what
ye
intend
to
do
as
touching
these
Acts5:36
For
before
these
days
rose
up
Theudas,
boasting
himself
to
be
to
whom
a
number
of
about
four
joine
d
who
was
and
as
many
as
obeyed
were
and
brought
to
Acts5:37
After
this
man
rose
up
Judas
of
Galilee
in
the
days
of
the
and
drew
away
much
people
after
he
also
and
even
as
many
as
obeyed
were
Acts5:38
And
now
I
say
unto
Refrain
from
these
and
let
them
for
if
this
counsel
or
this
work
be
of
it
will
co
me
to
Acts5:39
But
if
it
be
of
ye
cannot
overthrow
lest
haply
ye
be
found
even
to
fight
against
Acts5:40
And
to
him
they
and
when
they
had
called
the
and
beaten
they
commanded
that
they
should
not
speak
in
the
name
of
and
let
them
Acts5:41
And
they
departed
from
the
presence
of
the
rejoicing
that
they
were
counted
worthy
to
suffer
shame
for
his
Acts5:42
And
daily
in
the
and
in
every
they
ceased
not
to
teach
and
preach
Jesus
Acts6:1
And
in
those
when
the
number
of
the
disciples
was
there
arose
a
murmuring
of
the
Grecians
against
the
Heb
rews,
because
their
widows
were
neglected
in
the
daily
Acts6:2
Then
the
twelve
called
the
multitude
of
the
disciples
unto
and
It
is
not
reason
that
we
should
leave
the
word
o

and
serve

look
ye
out
among
you
seven
men
of
honest
full
of

Holy
Ghost
and
whom
we
may
appoi

over
this
Acts6:4
But
we
will
give
ourselves
continually
to
and
to
the
ministry
of
the
Acts6:5
And
the
saying
pleased
the
whole
and
they
chose
a
man
full
of
faith
and
of
the
Holy
and
and
Prochorus,
and
Nicanor,
and
and
Parmenas,
and
Nicolas
a
proselyte
of
Acts6:6
Whom
they
set
before
the
and
when
they
had
they
laid
their
hands
on
Acts6:7
And
the
word
of
God
and
the
number
of
the
disciples
multiplied
in
Jerusalem
and
a
great
company
of
the
priests
were
obedient
to
the
Acts6:8
And
full
of
faith
and
did
great
wonders
and
miracles
among
the
Acts6:9
Then
there
arose
certain
of
the
which
is
called
the
synagogue
of
the
and
Cyrenians,
and
Alexandrians
,
and
of
them
of
Cilicia
and
of
disputing
with
Acts6:10
And
they
were
not
able
to
resist
the
wisdom
and
the
spirit
by
which
he
Acts6:11
Then
they
suborned
which
We
have
heard
him
speak
blasphemous
words
against
and
against
Acts6:12
And
they
stirred
up
the
and
the
and
the
and
came
upon
and
caught
and
brought
him
to
the
Acts6:13
And
set
up
false
which
This
man
ceaseth
not
to
speak
blasphemous
words
against
this
holy
and
the

aw:
Acts6:14
For
we
have
heard
him
that
this
Jesus
of
Nazareth
shall
destroy
this
and
shall
change
the
customs
which
Moses
delivered
Acts6:15
And
all
that
sat
in
the
looking
stedfastly
on
saw
his
face
as
it
had
been
the
face
of

Then
said
the

And
he
and
The
God
of

appeared
unto
our
father
when
he
was
in
Mesopot

before
he
dwelt
in
Charran,
Acts7:3
And
said
unto
Get
thee
out
of
thy

from
thy

come
into
the
land
which
I
shall
shew
Acts7:4
Then
came
he
out
of
the
land
of
the
Chaldaeans,
and
dwelt
in
Charran:
and
from
when
his
father
was
he
removed
him
into
this
wherein

And
he
gave
him
none
inheritance
in
not
so
much
as
to
set

he
promised
that
he
would
give
it
to
him
for
a

to
his
seed
after
when
as
yet
he
had
no

And
God
spake
on
this
That

should
sojourn
in

strange
and
that

after

he
gave
him

of

And
delivered
him
out
of
all
his

gave
him
favour
and
wisdom
in
the
sight
of
Pharaoh
king
of
and
he
made
him
governor
over
Egypt
and
all

Now
there
came
a
dearth
over
all
the
land
of
Egypt
and
Chanaan,
and
great

our
fathers
found
no

But
when
Jacob
heard
that
there
was
corn
in

sent
out
our
fathers
Acts7:13
And
at
the
second
time
Joseph
was
made
known
to
his
and
Joseph's
kindred
was
made
known
unto

Then
sent

called
his
father
Jacob
to

all
his
threescore
and
fifteen

So
Jacob
went
down
into

And

carried
over

of

And
Moses
was
learned
in
all
the
wisdom
of

was
mighty
in
words

in

And
when
he
was
full
forty
years
it
came
into
his
heart
to
visit
his
brethren
the
children

And
seeing
one
of
them
suffer
he
defended
and
avenged
him

smote

For
he
supposed
his

would
have
understood
how
that
God
by

would
deliver

they
understood

And
the
next

he
shewed
himself
unto

abroad
throughout

in

one
that
feared

with
all

gave
much
alms
to

prayed
to
God

He
saw
in
a
vision
evidently
about
the
ninth
hour
of
the
day

angel
of
God
coming
in
to

saying
unto

looked
on

unto

of

devout
soldier
of

waited
on
him

when
he
had
declared
all

things
unto

sent
them
to

On
the
as
they
went
on
their
and
drew
nigh
unto

went
up
upon
the
housetop
to
pray
about

And
he
became
very
and
would
have
but
while
they
made
he
fell
into
a
Acts10:11
And
saw
heaven
and
a
certain
vessel
descending
unto
as
it
had
been
a
great
sheet
knit
at
the
four
a
nd
let
down
to
the
Acts10:12

were
all
manner
of
fourfooted
beasts
of

wild
and
creeping
and
fowls
of

there
came
a
voice
to

But
Peter
Not
for
I
have
never
eaten
any
thing
that
is
common
or
Acts10:15
And
the
voice
spake
unto
him
again
the
second
What
God
hath
that
call
not
thou
Acts10:16
This
was
done
and
the
vessel
was
received
up
again
into

Now
while
Peter
doubted
in
himself
what
this
vision
which
he
had
seen
should

men
which
were
sent
from
C
ornelius
had
made
enquiry
for
Simon's

stood
before
the

And
and
asked
whether
which
was
surnamed
were
lodged
Acts10:19
While
Peter
thought
on
the
the
Spirit
said
unto
three
men
seek
Acts10:20
Arise
and
get
thee
and
go
with
doubting

I
have

Peter
went
down
to

were
sent
unto

from

warned
from
God
by
an
holy
angel
to
send
for
thee
into

to
hear
words
of
Acts10:23
Then
called

them

lodged

on
the
morrow
Peter
went
away
with

from

And
as
Peter
was
coming
Cornelius
met

fell
down
at
his

worshipped

But
Peter
took
him
Stand
I
myself
also

Acts10:27
And
as
he
talked
with
he
went
and
found
many
that
were
come
Acts10:28
And
he
said
unto
Ye
know
how
that
it
is
an
unlawful
thing
for
a
man
that
is
a
Jew
to
keep
or
come
unto
one
of
another
but
God
hath
shewed
me
that
I
should
not
call
any
man
common
or

Therefore
came
I
unto
you
without
gainsaying,
as
soon
as
I
was
sent
I
ask
therefore
for
what
intent
ye
have
sent
for
Acts10:30
And
Cornelius
Four
days
ago
I
was
fasting
until
this
and
at
the
ninth
hour
I
prayed
in

man

before
me
in
bright
Acts10:31
And
thy
prayer
is

thine
alms
are
had
in

in
the
sight
of

Send
therefore
to

call
hither

is

lodged
in
the
house
of
one
Simon
a
tanner
b

when
he
shall
speak
unto

Immediately
therefore
I
sent
to

thou
hast
well
done
that
thou
art
Now
therefore
are
we
all
here
present
b

to
hear
all
things
that

of

Then
Peter
opened
his
and
Of
a
truth
I
perceive
that
God
is
no
respecter
of
Acts10:35
But
in
every
nation
he
that
feareth
and
worketh
is
accepted
with
Acts10:36
The
word
which
God
sent
unto
the
children
of
preaching
peace
by

is
Lord
of

And
we
are

raised

Not
to

unto
witnesses
chosen
before
of
even
to
who
did
eat
and
drink
with
him
after
he
rose
from

Acts10:42
And
he
commanded
us
to
preach
unto

to
testify
that
it
is
he
which
was
ordained
of
God
to
be
the
Judge

To
him
give
all

prophets
that
through

believeth
in

While
Peter
yet
spake
these
the
Holy
Ghost
fell
on
all
them
which
heard
the
Acts10:45
And
they
of

circumcision
which
believed

as
many
as
came
with

that
on

was
poured
out
the
gift
of

For
they
heard
them
speak
with

magnify

answered
Acts10:47
Can
any
man
forbid
that
these
should
not
be
which
have
received
the
Holy
Ghost
as
well
as
Acts10:48
And
he
commanded
them
to
be
baptized
in
the
name
of

Then
prayed
they
him
to
tarry
certain
Acts11:1
And
the
apostles
and
brethren
that
were
in
Judaea
heard
that
the
Gentiles
had
also
received
the
word
of
Acts11:2
And
when
Peter
was
come
up
to
they
that
were
of
the
circumcision
contended
with
Acts11:3
Thou
wentest
in
to
men
and
didst
eat
with
Acts11:4
But
Peter
rehearsed
the
matter
from
the
and
expounded
it
by
order
unto
Acts11:5
I
was
in
the
city
of
Joppa
and
in
a
trance
I
saw
a
A
certain
vessel
as
it
had
been
a
great
sheet
,
let
down
from
heaven
by
four
and
it
came
even
to
Acts11:6
Upon
the
which
when
I
had
fastened
mine
I
and
saw
fourfooted
beasts
of
the
and
wild
and
c
reeping
and
fowls
of
the
Acts11:7
And
I
heard
a
voice
saying
unto

and
Acts11:8
But
I
Not
for
nothing
common
or
unclean
hath
at
any
time
entered
into

But
the
voice
answered
me
again
from
What
God
hath
that
call
not
thou
Acts11:10
And
this
was
done
three
and
all
were
drawn
up
again
into
Acts11:11
immediately
there
were
three
men
already
come
unto
the
house
where
I
sent
from
Caesarea
unto
Acts11:12
And
the
Spirit
bade
me
go
with
nothing
Moreover
these
six
brethren
accompanied
and
we
entered
into
th
e
man's
Acts11:13
And
he
shewed
us
how
he
had
seen
an
angel
in
his
which
stood
and
said
unto
Send
men
to
and
call
for
Si
whose
surname
is
Acts11:14
Who
shall
tell
thee
whereby
thou
and
all
thy
house
shall
be

And
as
I
began
to
the
Holy
Ghost
fell
on
as
on
us
at
the
Acts11:16
Then
remembered
I
the
word
of
the
how
that
he
John
indeed
baptized
with
but
ye
shall
be
baptized
with
the
Holy
Acts11:17
Forasmuch
then
as
God
gave
them
the
like
gift
as
he
did
unto
who
believed
on
the
Lord
Jesus
what
was
that
I
could
withstand

Now
they
which
were
scattered
abroad
upon
the
persecution
that
arose
about
Stephen
travelled
as
far
as

and
Cypru
s,
and
preaching
the
word
to
none
but
unto
the
Jews
Acts11:20
And
some
of
them
were
men
of
Cyprus
and
when
they
were
come
to
spake
unto
the
Grecians,
preaching
the
LORD
Acts11:21
And
the
hand
of
the
Lord
was
with

a
great
number
and
turned
unto
the
Acts11:22
Then
tidings
of
these
things
came
unto
the
ears
of
the
church
which
was
in

they
sent
forth

he
should
go
as
far
as

in
these
days
came
prophets
from
Jerusalem
unto

And
there
stood
up
one
of

named
Agabus,
and
signified
by
the
Spirit
that
there
should
be
great
dearth
throughout
all
the
which
came
to
pass
in
the
days
of
Claudius

Then
the
every
man
according
to
his
determined
to
send
relief
unto
the
brethren
which
dwelt
in
Judaea
:

also
they

sent
it
to
the
elders

hands
of
Barnabas

Now
about
that
time
Herod
the
king
stretched
forth
his
hands
to
vex
certain

And
he
killed
James
the
brother
of
John

proceeded
further

put
him
in

Easter
to
bring
him

Peter
therefore
was
kept

there
they

righteousness
by
that
man
whom
he
hath
whereof
he
hath
given
assurance
unto
all
in
that
he
hath
raised
him
from
the
Acts17:32
And
when
they
heard
of
the
resurrection
of
the
some
and
others
We
will
hear
thee
again
of
this
matter
.
Acts17:33
So
Paul
departed
from
among
Acts17:34
Howbeit
certain
men
clave
unto
and
among
the
which
was
Dionysius
the
Areopagite,
and
a
woman
named
Damaris
,
and
others
with
Acts18:1
After
these
things
Paul
departed
from
and
came
to
Acts18:2
And
found
a
certain
Jew
named
born
in
lately
come
from
with
his
wife
(because
that
Claud
ius
had
commanded
all
Jews
to
depart
from
Rome:)
and
came
unto
Acts18:3
And
because
he
was
of
the
same
he
abode
with
and
for
by
their
occupation
they
were
tentmakers.
Acts18:4
And
he
reasoned
in
the
synagogue
every
and
persuaded
the
Jews
and
the
Acts18:5
And
when
Silas
and
Timotheus
were
come
from
Paul
was
pressed
in
the
and
testified
to
the
Jews
that
Jesu
s
was
Acts18:6
And
when
they
opposed
and
he
shook
his
and
said
unto
Your
blood
be
upon
your
own
he
I
am
from
henceforth
I
will
go
unto
the
Acts18:7
And
he
departed
and
entered
into
a
certain
man's
named
Justus,
one
that
worshipped
whose
house
joined
hard
to
the
Acts18:8
And
Crispus,
the
chief
ruler
of
the
believed
on
the
Lord
with
all
his
and
many
of
the
Corinthians
hearin
g
and
were
Acts18:9
Then
spake
the
Lord
to
Paul
in
the
night
by
a
Be
not
but
and
hold
not
thy
Acts18:10
For
I
am
with
and
no
man
shall
set
on
thee
to
hurt
for
I
have
much
people
in
this
Acts18:11
And
he
continued
there
a
year
and
six
teaching
the
word
of
God
among
Acts18:12
And
when
Gallio
was
the
deputy
of
Achaia,
the
Jews
made
insurrection
with
one
accord
against
and
brought
him
to
the
judgment
Acts18:13
This
fellow
persuadeth
men
to
worship
God
contrary
to
the
Acts18:14
And
when
Paul
was
now
about
to
open
his
Gallio
said
unto
the
If
it
were
a
matter
of
wrong
or
wicked
lewdness
,
O
ye
reason
would
that
I
should
bear
with
Acts18:15
But
if
it
be
a
question
of
words
and
and
of
your
look
ye
to
for
I
will
be
no
judge
of
such
Acts18:16
And
he
drave
them
from
the
judgment
Acts18:17
Then
all
the
Greeks
took
Sosthenes,
the
chief
ruler
of
the
and
beat
him
before
the
judgment
And
Gallio
c
ared
for
none
of
those
Acts18:18
And
Paul
after
this
tarried
there
yet
a
good
and
then
took
his
leave
of
the
and
sailed
thence
into
Syria
,
and
with
him
Priscilla
and
having
shorn
his
head
in
Cenchrea:
for
he
had
a
Acts18:19
And
he
came
to
and
left
them
but
he
himself
entered
into
the
and
reasoned
with
the
Acts18:20
When
they
desired
him
to
tarry
longer
time
with
he
consented
Acts18:21
But
bade
them
I
must
by
all
means
keep
this
feast
that
cometh
in
but
I
will
return
again
unt
o
if

And
he
sailed
from
Acts18:22
And
when
he
had
landed
at
and
gone
and
saluted
the
he
went
down
to
Acts18:23
And
after
he
had
spent
some
time
he
and
went
over
all
the
country
of
Galatia
and
Phrygia
in
stren
gthening
all
the
Acts18:24
And
a
certain
Jew
named
Apollos,
born
at
an
eloquent
and
mighty
in
the
came
to
Acts18:25
This
man
was
instructed
in
the
way
of
the
and
being
fervent
in
the
he
spake
and
taught
diligently
the
thing
s
of
the
knowing
only
the
baptism
of
Acts18:26
And
he
began
to
speak
boldly
in
the
whom
when
Aquila
and
Priscilla
had
they
took
him
unto
and
exp
ounded
unto
him
the
way
of
God
more
Acts18:27
And
when
he
was
disposed
to
pass
into
Achaia,
the
brethren
exhorting
the
disciples
to
receive
when
he
wa
s
helped
them
much
which
had
believed
through
Acts18:28
For
he
mightily
convinced
the
and
that
publickly,
shewing
by
the
scriptures
that
Jesus
was
Acts19:1
And
it
came
to
while
Apollos
was
at
Paul
having
passed
through
the
upper
coasts
came
to
and
finding
certain
Acts19:2
He
said
unto
Have
ye
received
the
Holy
Ghost
since
ye
And
they
said
unto
We
have
not
so
much
as
heard
whether
there
be
any
Holy
Acts19:3
And
he
said
unto
Unto
what
then
were
ye
And
they
Unto
John's
Acts19:4
Then
said
John
verily
baptized
with
the
baptism
of
saying
unto
the
that
they
should
believe
on
h
im
which
should
come
after
that
on
Christ
Acts19:5
When
they
heard
they
were
baptized
in
the
name
of
the
Lord
Acts19:6
And
when
Paul
had
laid
his
hands
upon
the
Holy
Ghost
came
on
and
they
spake
with
and
Acts19:7
And
all
the
men
were
about
Acts19:8
And
he
went
into
the
and
spake
boldly
for
the
space
of
three
disputing
and
persuading
the
things
concer
ning
the
kingdom
of
Acts19:9
But
when
divers
were
and
believed
but
spake
evil
of
that
way
before
the
he
departed
from
a
nd
separated
the
disputing
daily
in
the
school
of
one
Tyrannus.
Acts19:10
And
this
continued
by
the
space
of
two
so
that
all
they
which
dwelt
in
Asia
heard
the
word
of
the
Lord
both
Jews
and
Acts19:11
And
God
wrought
special
miracles
by
the
hands
of
Acts19:12
So
that
from
his
body
were
brought
unto
the
sick
handkerchiefs
or
and
the
diseases
departed
from
and
the
ev
il
spirits
went
out
of
Acts19:13
Then
certain
of
the
vagabond
exorcists,
took
upon
them
to
call
over
them
which
had
evil
spirits
the
name
of
the
LOR
D
We
adjure
you
by
Jesus
whom
Paul
preacheth.
Acts19:14
And
there
were
seven
sons
of
one
Sceva,
a
and
chief
of
the
which
did
Acts19:15
And
the
evil
spirit
answered
and
Jesus
I
and
Paul
I
but
who
are
Acts19:16
And
the
man
in
whom
the
evil
spirit
was
leaped
on
and
overcame
and
prevailed
against
so
that
they
fled
out
of
that
house
naked
and
Acts19:17
And
this
was
known
to
all
the
Jews
and
Greeks
also
dwelling
at
and
fear
fell
on
them
and
the
name
of
the
Lo
rd
Jesus
was
Acts19:18
And
many
that
believed
and
and
shewed
their
Acts19:19
Many
of
them
also
which
used
curious
arts
brought
their
books
and
burned
them
before
all
and
they
counted
the
price
of
and
found
it
fifty
thousand
pieces
of
Acts19:20
So
mightily
grew
the
word
of
God
and
Acts19:21
After
these
things
were
Paul
purposed
in
the
when
he
had
passed
through
Macedonia
and
Achaia,
to
go
to
Jer
usalem,
After
I
have
been
I
must
also
see
Acts19:22
So
he
sent
into
Macedonia
two
of
them
that
ministered
unto
Timotheus
and
but
he
himself
stayed
in
Asia
for
a
Acts19:23
And
the
same
time
there
arose
no
small
stir
about
that
Acts19:24
For
a
certain
man
named
Demetrius,
a
which
made
silver
shrines
for
brought
no
small
gain
unto
the
cra
ftsmen;
Acts19:25
Whom
he
called
together
with
the
workmen
of
like
and
ye
know
that
by
this
craft
we
have
our
wealt
h.
Acts19:26
Moreover
ye
see
and
that
not
alone
at
but
almost
throughout
all
this
Paul
hath
persuaded
and
turned
away
much
saying
that
they
be
no
which
are
made
with
Acts19:27
So
that
not
only
this
our
craft
is
in
danger
to
be
set
at
but
also
that
the
temple
of
the
great
goddess
Diana
sho
uld
be
and
her
magnificence
should
be
whom
all
Asia
and
the
world
worshippeth.
Acts19:28
And
when
they
heard
these
they
were
full
of
and
cried
Great
is
Diana
of
the
Acts19:29
And
the
whole
city
was
filled
with
and
having
caught
Gaius
and
men
of
Paul's
companion
s
in
they
rushed
with
one
accord
into
the
Acts19:30
And
when
Paul
would
have
entered
in
unto
the
the
disciples
suffered
him
Acts19:31
And
certain
of
the
chief
of
which
were
his
sent
unto
desiring
him
that
he
would
not
adventure
himself
into
the
Acts19:32
Some
therefore
cried
one
and
some
for
the
assembly
was
and
the
more
part
knew
not
wherefore
the
y
were
come
Acts19:33
And
they
drew
Alexander
out
of
the
the
Jews
putting
him
And
Alexander
beckoned
with
the
and
wou
ld
have
made
his
defence
unto
the
Acts19:34
But
when
they
knew
that
he
was
a
all
with
one
voice
about
the
space
of
two
hours
cried
Great
is
Diana
of
the
Ep
hesians.
Acts19:35
And
when
the
townclerk
had
appeased
the
he
Ye
men
of
what
man
is
there
that
knoweth
not
how
that
t
he
city
of
the
Ephesians
is
a
worshipper
of
the
great
goddess
and
of
the
image
which
fell
down
from
Acts19:36
Seeing
then
that
these
things
cannot
be
spoken
ye
ought
to
be
and
to
do
nothing
Acts19:37
For
ye
have
brought
hither
these
which
are
neither
robbers
of
nor
yet
blasphemers
of
your
Acts19:38
Wherefore
if
Demetrius,
and
the
craftsmen
which
are
with
have
a
matter
against
any
the
law
is
and
there
a
re
let
them
implead
one
Acts19:39
But
if
ye
enquire
any
thing
concerning
other
it
shall
be
determined
in
a
lawful
Acts19:40
For
we
are
in
danger
to
be
called
in
question
for
this
day's
there
being
no
cause
whereby
we
may
give
an
account
of
this
Acts19:41
And
when
he
had
thus
he
dismissed
the
Acts20:1
And
after
the
uproar
was
Paul
called
unto
him
the
and
embraced
and
departed
for
to
go
into
Macedo
nia.
Acts20:2
And
when
he
had
gone
over
those
and
had
given
them
much
he
came
into
Acts20:3
And
there
abode
three
And
when
the
Jews
laid
wait
for
as
he
was
about
to
sail
into
he
purposed
to
retu

through
Acts20:4
And
there
accompanied
him
into
Asia
Sopater
of
and
of
the
Aristarchus
and
Secundus;
and
Gaius
of
Der
and
Timotheus;
and
of
Tychicus
and
Trophimus.
Acts20:5
These
going
before
tarried
for
us
at
Acts20:6
And
we
sailed
away
from
Philippi
after
the
days
of
unleavened
and
came
unto
them
to
Troas
in
five
where
we
ab
ode
seven
Acts20:7
And
upon
the
first
day
of
the
when
the
disciples
came
together
to
break
Paul
preached
unto
ready
to
dep
art
on
the
and
continued
his
speech
until
Acts20:8
And
there
were
many
lights
in
the
upper
where
they
were
gathered
Acts20:9
And
there
sat
in
a
window
a
certain
young
man
named
Eutychus,
being
fallen
into
a
deep
and
as
Paul
was
long
preachi
ng,
he
sunk
down
with
and
fell
down
from
the
third
and
was
taken
up
Acts20:10
And
Paul
went
and
fell
on
and
embracing
him
Trouble
not
for
his
life
is
in
Acts20:11
When
he
therefore
was
come
up
and
had
broken
and
and
talked
a
long
even
till
break
of
so
he
Acts20:12
And
they
brought
the
young
man
and
were
not
a
little
Acts20:13
And
we
went
before
to
and
sailed
unto
Assos,
there
intending
to
take
in
for
so
had
he
minding
hims
elf
to
go
Acts20:14
And
when
he
met
with
us
at
Assos,
we
took
him
and
came
to
Mitylene.
Acts20:15
And
we
sailed
and
came
the
next
day
over
against
and
the
next
day
we
arrived
at
and
tarried
at
Trog
yllium;
and
the
next
day
we
came
to
Acts20:16
For
Paul
had
determined
to
sail
by
because
he
would
not
spend
the
time
in
for
he
if
it
were
possib
le
for
to
be
at
Jerusalem
the
day
of
Acts20:17
And
from
Miletus
he
sent
to
and
called
the
elders
of
the
Acts20:18
And
when
they
were
come
to
he
said
unto
Ye
from
the
first
day
that
I
came
into
after
what
manner
I
have
been
with
you
at
all
Acts20:19
Serving
the
LORD
with
all
humility
of
and
with
many
and
which
befell
me
by
the
lying
in
wait
of
the
Acts20:20
And
how
I
kept
back
nothing
that
was
profitable
unto
but
have
shewed
and
have
taught
you
publickly,
and
from
ho
use
to
Acts20:21
Testifying
both
to
the
and
also
to
the
repentance
toward
and
faith
toward
our
Lord
Jesus
Acts20:22
And
I
go
bound
in
the
spirit
unto
not
knowing
the
things
that
shall
befall
me
Acts20:23
Save
that
the
Holy
Ghost
witnesseth
in
every
saying
that
bonds
and
afflictions
abide
Acts20:24
But
none
of
these
things
move
neither
count
I
my
life
dear
unto
so
that
I
might
finish
my
course
with
an
d
the
which
I
have
received
of
the
Lord
to
testify
the
gospel
of
the
grace
of
Acts20:25
And
I
know
that
ye
among
whom
I
have
gone
preaching
the
kingdom
of
shall
see
my
face
no
Acts20:26
Wherefore
I
take
you
to
record
this
that
I
am
pure
from
the
blood
of
all
Acts20:27
For
I
have
not
shunned
to
declare
unto
you
all
the
counsel
of
Acts20:28
Take
heed
therefore
unto
and
to
all
the
over
the
which
the
Holy
Ghost
hath
made
you
to
feed
the
church
of
which
he
hath
purchased
with
his
own
Acts20:29
For
I
know
that
after
my
departing
shall
grievous
wolves
enter
in
among
not
sparing
the
Acts20:30
Also
of
your
own
selves
shall
men
speaking
perverse
to
draw
away
disciples
after
Acts20:31
Therefore
and
that
by
the
space
of
three
years
I
ceased
not
to
warn
every
one
night
and
day
with
Acts20:32
And
I
commend
you
to
and
to
the
word
of
his
which
is
able
to
build
you
and
to
give
you
an
inheritance
among
all
them
which
are
Acts20:33
I
have
coveted
no
man's
or
or
Acts20:34
ye
yourselves
that
these
hands
have
ministered
unto
my
and
to
them
that
were
with
Acts20:35
I
have
shewed
you
all
how
that
so
labouring
ye
ought
to
support
the
and
to
remember
the
words
of
the
Lord
J
esus,
how
he
It
is
more
blessed
to
give
than
to
Acts20:36
And
when
he
had
thus
he
kneeled
and
prayed
with
them
Acts20:37
And
they
all
wept
and
fell
on
Paul's
and
kissed
Acts20:38
Sorrowing
most
of
all
for
the
words
which
he
that
they
should
see
his
face
no
And
they
accompanied
him
unto
the
Acts21:1
And
it
came
to
that
after
we
were
gotten
from
and
had
we
came
with
a
straight
course
unto
Coos,
and
the
day
following
unto
and
from
thence
unto
Patara:
Acts21:2
And
finding
a
ship
sailing
over
unto
Phenicia,
we
went
and
set
Acts21:3
Now
when
we
had
discovered
we
left
it
on
the
left
and
sailed
into
and
landed
at
for
there
the
s
hip
was
to
unlade
her
Acts21:4
And
finding
we
tarried
there
seven
who
said
to
Paul
through
the
that
he
should
not
go
up
to
Jerus
alem.
Acts21:5
And
when
we
had
accomplished
those
we
departed
and
went
our
and
they
all
brought
us
on
our
with
wives
and
till
we
were
out
of
the
and
we
kneeled
down
on
the
and
Acts21:6
And
when
we
had
taken
our
leave
one
of
we
took
and
they
returned
home
Acts21:7
And
when
we
had
finished
our
course
from
we
came
to
Ptolemais,
and
saluted
the
and
abode
with
them
one
day
.
Acts21:8
And
the
next
day
we
that
were
of
Paul's
company
and
came
unto
and
we
entered
into
the
house
of
Philip
the
which
was
one
of
the
and
abode
with
Acts21:9
And
the
same
man
had
four
which
did
Acts21:10
And
as
we
tarried
there
many
there
came
down
from
Judaea
a
certain
named
Agabus.
Acts21:11
And
when
he
was
come
unto
he
took
Paul's
and
bound
his
own
hands
and
and
Thus
saith
the
Holy
Ghos
t,
So
shall
the
Jews
at
Jerusalem
bind
the
man
that
owneth
this
and
shall
deliver
him
into
the
hands
of
the
Acts21:12
And
when
we
heard
these
both
and
they
of
that
besought
him
not
to
go
up
to
Acts21:13
Then
Paul
What
mean
ye
to
weep
and
to
break
mine
for
I
am
ready
not
to
be
bound
but
also
to
die
at
Jerusalem
for
the
name
of
the
Lord
Acts21:14
And
when
he
would
not
be
we
The
will
of
the
Lord
be
Acts21:15
And
after
those
days
we
took
up
our
and
went
up
to
Acts21:16
There
went
with
us
also
certain
of
the
disciples
of
and
brought
with
them
one
Mnason
of
an
old
disciple
,
with
whom
we
should
Acts21:17
And
when
we
were
come
to
the
brethren
received
us
Acts21:18
And
the
day
following
Paul
went
in
with
us
unto
and
all
the
elders
were
Acts21:19
And
when
he
had
saluted
he
declared
particularly
what
things
God
had
wrought
among
the
Gentiles
by
his
Acts21:20
And
when
they
heard
they
glorified
the
and
said
unto
Thou
seest,
how
many
thousands
of
Jews
there
are
which
and
they
are
all
zealous
of
the
Acts21:21
And
they
are
informed
of
that
thou
teachest
all
the
Jews
which
are
among
the
Gentiles
to
forsake
saying
that
they
ought
not
to
circumcise
their
neither
to
walk
after
the
Acts21:22
What
is
it
the
multitude
must
needs
come
for
they
will
hear
that
thou
art
Acts21:23
Do
therefore
this
that
we
say
to
We
have
four
men
which
have
a
vow
on
Acts21:24
Them
and
purify
thyself
with
and
be
at
charges
with
that
they
may
shave
their
and
all
may
know
t
hat
those
whereof
they
were
informed
concerning
are
but
that
thou
thyself
also
walkest
and
keepest
the
Acts21:25
As
touching
the
Gentiles
which
we
have
written
and
concluded
that
they
observe
no
such
save
only
that
the
y
keep
themselves
from
things
offered
to
and
from
and
from
and
from
Acts21:26
Then
Paul
took
the
and
the
next
day
purifying
himself
with
them
entered
into
the
to
signify
the
accomplishme
nt
of
the
days
of
until
that
an
offering
should
be
offered
for
every
one
of
Acts21:27
And
when
the
seven
days
were
almost
the
Jews
which
were
of

they
saw
him
in
the
stirred
up
all
t

and
laid
hands
on
Acts21:28
Crying
Men
of

teacheth
all
men
every

this

further
brought
Greeks
also
into
the
and
hath
polluted
this
holy
Acts21:29
(For
they
had
seen
before
with
him
in
the
city
Trophimus
an
whom
they
supposed
that
Paul
had
brought
into
the
t
emple.)
Acts21:30
And
all
the
city
was
and
the
people
ran
and
they
took
and
drew
him
out
of
the
and
forthwit
h
the
doors
were
Acts21:31
And
as
they
went
about
to
kill
tidings
came
unto
the
chief
captain
of
the
that
all
Jerusalem
was
in
an
Acts21:32
Who
immediately
took
soldiers
and
centurions,
and
ran
down
unto
and
when
they
saw
the
chief
captain
and
the
soldier
s,
they
left
beating
of
Acts21:33
Then
the
chief
captain
came
and
took
and
commanded
him
to
be
bound
with
two
and
demanded
who
he
a
nd
what
he
had
Acts21:34
And
some
cried
one
some
among
the
and
when
he
could
not
know
the
certainty
for
the
he
commanded
him
to
be
carried
into
the
Acts21:35
And
when
he
came
upon
the
so
it
that
he
was
borne
of
the
soldiers
for
the
violence
of
the
Acts21:36
For
the
multitude
of
the
people
followed
Away
with
Acts21:37
And
as
Paul
was
to
be
led
into
the
he
said
unto
the
chief
May
I
speak
unto
Who
Canst
thou
sp
eak
Acts21:38
Art
not
thou
that
which
before
these
days
madest
an
and
leddest
out
into
the
wilderness
four
thousand
m

that
were

But
Paul
I
am
a
man
which
am
a
Jew
of
a
city
in
a
citizen
of
no
mean
I
beseech
su
ffer
me
to
speak
unto
the
Acts21:40
And
when
he
had
given
him
Paul
stood
on
the
and
beckoned
with
the
hand
unto
the
And
when
there
w
as
made
a
great
he
spake
unto
them
in
the
Hebrew
Acts22:1
and
hear
ye
my
defence
which
I
make
now
unto
Acts22:2
(And
when
they
heard
that
he
spake
in
the
Hebrew
tongue
to
they
kept
the
more
and
he
saith,)
Acts22:3
I
am
verily
a
man
which
am
a
born
in
a
city
in
yet
brought
up
in
this
city
at
the
feet
of
Gamaliel,
and
taught
according
to
the
perfect
manner
of
the
law
of
the
and
was
zealous
toward
as
ye
all
are
this
Acts22:4
And
I
persecuted
this
way
unto
the
binding
and
delivering
into
prisons
both
men
and
Acts22:5
As
also
the
high
priest
doth
bear
me
and
all
the
estate
of
the
from
whom
also
I
received
letters
unto
the
and
went
to
to
bring
them
which
were
there
bound
unto
for
to
be
Acts22:6
And
it
came
to
as
I
made
my
and
was
come
nigh
unto
Damascus
about
suddenly
there
shone
from
hea
ven
a
great
light
round
about
Acts22:7
And
I
fell
unto
the
and
heard
a
voice
saying
unto
why
persecutest
thou
Acts22:8
And
I
Who
art
And
he
said
unto
I
am
Jesus
of
whom
thou
persecutest.
Acts22:9
And
they
that
were
with
me
saw
indeed
the
and
were
but
they
heard
not
the
voice
of
him
that
spake
to
Acts22:10
And
I
What
shall
I
And
the
Lord
said
unto
and
go
into
and
there
it
shall
be
told
the
e
of
all
things
which
are
appointed
for
thee
to
Acts22:11
And
when
I
could
not
see
for
the
glory
of
that
being
led
by
the
hand
of
them
that
were
with
I
came
into
Damasc
Acts22:12
And
one
a
devout
man
according
to
the
having
a
good
report
of
all
the
Jews
which
dwelt
Acts22:13
Came
unto
and
and
said
unto
Brother
receive
thy
And
the
same
hour
I
looked
up
upon
Acts22:14
And
he
The
God
of
our
fathers
hath
chosen
that
thou
shouldest
know
his
and
see
that
Just
and
shoul
dest
hear
the
voice
of
his
Acts22:15
For
thou
shalt
be
his
witness
unto
all
men
of
what
thou
hast
seen
and
Acts22:16
And
now
why
tarriest
and
be
and
wash
away
thy
calling
on
the
name
of
the
Acts22:17
And
it
came
to
when
I
was
come
again
to
even
while
I
prayed
in
the
I
was
in
a
Acts22:18
And
saw
him
saying
unto
Make
and
get
thee
quickly
out
of
for
they
will
not
receive
thy
testimony
co
ncerning
Acts22:19
And
I
they
know
that
I
imprisoned
and
beat
in
every
synagogue
them
that
believed
on
Acts22:20
And
when
the
blood
of
thy
martyr
Stephen
was
I
also
was
standing
and
consenting
unto
his
and
kept
the
ra
iment
of
them
that
slew
Acts22:21
And
he
said
unto
for
I
will
send
thee
far
hence
unto
the
Acts22:22
And
they
gave
him
audience
unto
this
and
then
lifted
up
their
and
Away
with
such
a
fellow
from
the
ea
rth:
for
it
is
not
fit
that
he
should
Acts22:23
And
as
they
cried
and
cast
off
their
and
threw
dust
into
the
Acts22:24
The
chief
captain
commanded
him
to
be
brought
into
the
and
bade
that
he
should
be
examined
by
that
he
might
know
wherefore
they
cried
so
against
Acts22:25
And
as
they
bound
him
with
thongs,
Paul
said
unto
the
centurion
that
stood
Is
it
lawful
for
you
to
scourge
a
man
that
is
a
and
uncondemned?
Acts22:26
When
the
centurion
heard
he
went
and
told
the
chief
Take
heed
what
thou
doest:
for
this
man
is
a
R
Acts22:27
Then
the
chief
captain
and
said
unto
Tell
art
thou
a
He
Acts22:28
And
the
chief
captain
With
a
great
sum
obtained
I
this
And
Paul
But
I
was
free
Acts22:29
Then
straightway
they
departed
from
him
which
should
have
examined
and
the
chief
captain
also
was
after
he
k
new
that
he
was
a
and
because
he
had
bound
Acts22:30
On
the
because
he
would
have
known
the
certainty
wherefore
he
was
accused
of
the
he
loosed
him
from
his
ban
ds,
and
commanded
the
chief
priests
and
all
their
council
to
and
brought
Paul
and
set
him
before
Acts23:1
And
earnestly
beholding
the
Men
and
I
have
lived
in
all
good
conscience
before
God
until
th
is
Acts23:2
And
the
high
priest
Ananias
commanded
them
that
stood
by
him
to
smite
him
on
the
Acts23:3
Then
said
Paul
unto
God
shall
smite
thou
whited
for
sittest
thou
to
judge
me
after
the
and
commandes
t
me
to
be
smitten
contrary
to
the
Acts23:4
And
they
that
stood
by
Revilest
thou
God's
high
Acts23:5
Then
said
I
wist
that
he
was
the
high
for
it
is
Thou
shalt
not
speak
evil
of
the
rul
er
of
thy
Acts23:6
But
when
Paul
perceived
that
the
one
part
were
Sadducees,
and
the
other
Pharisees,
he
cried
out
in
the
Men
and
br
ethren,
I
am
a
the
son
of
a
of
the
hope
and
resurrection
of
the
dead
I
am
called
in
Acts23:7
And
when
he
had
so
there
arose
a
dissension
between
the
Pharisees
and
the
Sadducees:
and
the
multitude
was
Acts23:8
For
the
Sadducees
say
that
there
is
no
neither
nor
but
the
Pharisees
confess
Acts23:9
And
there
arose
a
great
and
the
scribes
that
were
of
the
Pharisees'
part
and
We
find
no
evil
i
n
this
but
if
a
spirit
or
an
angel
hath
spoken
to
let
us
not
fight
against
Acts23:10
And
when
there
arose
a
great
the
chief
fearing
lest
Paul
should
have
been
pulled
in
pieces
of
commanded
the
soldiers
to
go
and
to
take
him
by
force
from
among
and
to
bring
him
into
the
Acts23:11
And
the
night
following
the
Lord
stood
by
and
Be
of
good
for
as
thou
hast
testified
of
me
in
Jeru
so
must
thou
bear
witness
also
at
Acts23:12
And
when
it
was
certain
of
the
Jews
banded
and
bound
themselves
under
a
saying
that
they
would
neit
her
eat
nor
drink
till
they
had
killed
Acts23:13
And
they
were
more
than
forty
which
had
made
this
Acts23:14
And
they
came
to
the
chief
priests
and
and
We
have
bound
ourselves
under
a
great
that
we
will
eat
no
thing
until
we
have
slain
Acts23:15
Now
therefore
ye
with
the
council
signify
to
the
chief
captain
that
he
bring
him
down
unto
you
to
as
though
ye
wo
uld
enquire
something
more
perfectly
concerning
and
or
ever
he
come
are
ready
to
kill
Acts23:16
And
when
Paul's
sister's
son
heard
of
their
lying
in
he
went
and
entered
into
the
and
told
Acts23:17
Then
Paul
called
one
of
the
centurions
unto
and
Bring
this
young
man
unto
the
chief
for
he
hath
a
cer
tain
thing
to
tell
Acts23:18
So
he
took
and
brought
him
to
the
chief
and
Paul
the
prisoner
called
me
unto
and
prayed
me
to
br
ing
this
young
man
unto
who
hath
something
to
say
unto
Acts23:19
Then
the
chief
captain
took
him
by
the
and
went
with
him
aside
and
asked
What
is
that
thou
hast
to
tell
Acts23:20
And
he
The
Jews
have
agreed
to
desire
thee
that
thou
wouldest
bring
down
Paul
to
morrow
into
the
as
though
they
would
enquire
somewhat
of
him
more
Acts23:21
But
do
not
thou
yield
unto
for
there
lie
in
wait
for
him
of
them
more
than
forty
which
have
bound
themselves
w
ith
an
that
they
will
neither
eat
nor
drink
till
they
have
killed
and
now
are
they
looking
for
a
promise
from
the
e.
Acts23:22
So
the
chief
captain
then
let
the
young
man
and
charged
See
thou
tell
no
man
that
thou
hast
shewed
these
thi
ngs
to
Acts23:23
And
he
called
unto
him
two
centurions,
Make
ready
two
hundred
soldiers
to
go
to
and
horsemen
threescore
and
and
spearmen
two
at
the
third
hour
of
the
Acts23:24
And
provide
them
that
they
may
set
Paul
and
bring
him
safe
unto
Felix
the
Acts23:25
And
he
wrote
a
letter
after
this
Acts23:26
Claudius
Lysias
unto
the
most
excellent
governor
Felix
sendeth
Acts23:27
This
man
was
taken
of
the
and
should
have
been
killed
of
then
came
I
with
an
and
rescued
having
un
derstood
that
he
was
a
Acts23:28
And
when
I
would
have
known
the
cause
wherefore
they
accused
I
brought
him
forth
into
their
Acts23:29
Whom
I
perceived
to
be
accused
of
questions
of
their
but
to
have
nothing
laid
to
his
charge
worthy
of
death
or
of
bo
nds.
Acts23:30
And
when
it
was
told
me
how
that
the
Jews
laid
wait
for
the
I
sent
straightway
to
and
gave
commandment
to
his
accusers
also
to
say
before
thee
what
they
had
against
Acts23:31
Then
the
as
it
was
commanded
took
and
brought
him
by
night
to
Antipatris.
Acts23:32
On
the
morrow
they
left
the
horsemen
to
go
with
and
returned
to
the
Acts23:33
when
they
came
to
and
delivered
the
epistle
to
the
presented
Paul
also
before
Acts23:34
And
when
the
governor
had
read
the
he
asked
of
what
province
he
And
when
he
understood
that
he
was
of
Cilici
Acts23:35
I
will
hear
said
when
thine
accusers
are
also
And
he
commanded
him
to
be
kept
in
Herod's
judgment
Acts24:1
And
after
five
days
Ananias
the
high
priest
descended
with
the
and
with
a
certain
orator
named
Tertullus,
who
info
rmed
the
governor
against
Acts24:2
And
when
he
was
called
Tertullus
began
to
accuse
Seeing
that
by
thee
we
enjoy
great
and
tha
t
very
worthy
deeds
are
done
unto
this
nation
by
thy
Acts24:3
We
accept
it
and
in
all
most
noble
with
all
Acts24:4
that
I
be
not
further
tedious
unto
I
pray
thee
that
thou
wouldest
hear
us
of
thy
clemency
a
few
wor
ds.
Acts24:5
For
we
have
found
this
man
a
pestilent
and
a
mover
of
sedition
among
all
the
Jews
throughout
the
and
a
ring
leader
of
the
sect
of
the
Nazarenes:
Acts24:6
Who
also
hath
gone
about
to
profane
the
whom

and
would
have
judged
according
to
our
Acts24:7
But
the
chief
captain
Lysias
came
upon
and
with
great
violence
took
him
away
out
of
our
Acts24:8
Commanding
his
accusers
to
come
unto
by
examining
of
whom
thyself
mayest
take
knowledge
of
all
these
whereof
we
accuse
Acts24:9
And
the
Jews
also
saying
that
these
things
were
Acts24:10
Then
after
that
the
governor
had
beckoned
unto
him
to
Forasmuch
as
I
know
that
thou
hast
been
of
m
any
years
a
judge
unto
this
I
do
the
more
cheerfully
answer
for
Acts24:11
Because
that
thou
mayest
that
there
are
yet
but
twelve
days
since
I
went
up
to
Jerusalem
for
to
Acts24:12
And
they
neither
found
me
in
the
temple
disputing
with
any
neither
raising
up
the
neither
in
the
nor
in
the
Acts24:13
Neither
can
they
prove
the
things
whereof
they
now
accuse
Acts24:14
But
this
I
confess
unto
that
after
the
way
which
they
call
so
worship
I
the
God
of
my
believing
al
l
things
which
are
written
in
the
law
and
in
the
Acts24:15
And
have
hope
toward
which
they
themselves
also
that
there
shall
be
a
resurrection
of
the
both
of
the
j
ust
and
Acts24:16
And
herein
do
I
exercise
to
have
always
a
conscience
void
of
offence
toward
and
toward
Acts24:17
Now
after
many
years
I
came
to
bring
alms
to
my
and
Acts24:18
Whereupon
certain
Jews
from
Asia
found
me
purified
in
the
neither
with
nor
with
Acts24:19
Who
ought
to
have
been
here
before
and
if
they
had
ought
against
Acts24:20
Or
else
let
these
same
here
if
they
have
found
any
evil
doing
in
while
I
stood
before
the
Acts24:21
Except
it
be
for
this
one
that
I
cried
standing
among
Touching
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
I
am
called
in
q
uestion
by
you
this
Acts24:22
And
when
Felix
heard
these
having
more
perfect
knowledge
of
that
he
deferred
and
When
Lysias
the
chief
captain
shall
come
I
will
know
the
uttermost
of
your
Acts24:23
And
he
commanded
a
centurion
to
keep
and
to
let
him
have
and
that
he
should
forbid
none
of
his
acquaintanc
e
to
minister
or
come
unto
Acts24:24
And
after
certain
when
Felix
came
with
his
wife
Drusilla,
which
was
a
he
sent
for
and
heard
him
conce
rning
the
faith
in
Acts24:25
And
as
he
reasoned
of
and
judgment
to
Felix
and
Go
thy
way
for
this
when
I
have
a
convenient
I
will
call
for
Acts24:26
He
hoped
also
that
money
should
have
been
given
him
of
that
he
might
loose
wherefore
he
sent
for
him
the
often
er,
and
communed
with
Acts24:27
But
after
two
years
Porcius
Festus
came
into
and
willing
to
shew
the
Jews
a
left
Paul
bound
.
Acts25:1
Now
when
Festus
was
come
into
the
after
three
days
he
ascended
from
Caesarea
to
Acts25:2
Then
the
high
priest
and
the
chief
of
the
Jews
informed
him
against
and
besought
Acts25:3
And
desired
favour
against
that
he
would
send
for
him
to
laying
wait
in
the
way
to
kill
Acts25:4
But
Festus
that
Paul
should
be
kept
at
and
that
he
himself
would
depart
shortly
Acts25:5
Let
them
said
which
among
you
are
go
down
with
and
accuse
this
if
there
be
any
wickedness
in
Acts25:6
And
when
he
had
tarried
among
them
more
than
ten
he
went
down
unto
and
the
next
day
sitting
on
the
judgmen
t
seat
commanded
Paul
to
be
Acts25:7
And
when
he
was
the
Jews
which
came
down
from
Jerusalem
stood
round
and
laid
many
and
grievous
complaints
aga
inst
which
they
could
not

While
he
answered
for
Neither
against
the
law
of

neither
against
the
nor
yet
against

ve
I
offended
any
thing
at
Acts25:9
But
Festus,
willing
to
do
the
Jews
a
answered
and
Wilt
thou
go
up
to
and
there
be
judged
of
these
things
before
Acts25:10
Then
said
I
stand
at
Caesar's
judgment
where
I
ought
to
be
to
the
Jews
have
I
done
no
as
thou
very
well
knowest.
Acts25:11
For
if
I
be
an
or
have
committed
any
thing
worthy
of
I
refuse
not
to
but
if
there
be
none
of
these
things
whereof
these
accuse
no
man
may
deliver
me
unto
I
appeal
unto
Acts25:12
Then
Festus,
when
he
had
conferred
with
the
Hast
thou
appealed
unto
unto
Caesar
shalt
thou
Acts25:13
And
after
certain
days
king
Agrippa
and
Bernice
came
unto
Caesarea
to
salute
Festus.
Acts25:14
And
when
they
had
been
there
many
Festus
declared
Paul's
cause
unto
the
There
is
a
certain
man
left
i
n
bonds
by
Acts25:15
About
when
I
was
at
the
chief
priests
and
the
elders
of
the
Jews
informed
desiring
to
have
judgment
against
Acts25:16
To
whom
I
It
is
not
the
manner
of
the
Romans
to
deliver
any
man
to
before
that
he
which
is
accused
have
th
e
accusers
face
to
and
have
licence
to
answer
for
himself
concerning
the
crime
laid
against
Acts25:17
when
they
were
come
without
any
delay
on
the
morrow
I
sat
on
the
judgment
and
commanded
the
man
to
be
brought
Acts25:18
Against
whom
when
the
accusers
stood
they
brought
none
accusation
of
such
things
as
I
Acts25:19
But
had
certain
questions
against
him
of
their
own
and
of
one
which
was
whom
Paul
affirmed
to
be
Acts25:20
And
because
I
doubted
of
such
manner
of
I
asked
him
whether
he
would
go
to
and
there
be
judged
of
t
hese
Acts25:21
But
when
Paul
had
appealed
to
be
reserved
unto
the
hearing
of
I
commanded
him
to
be
kept
till
I
might
send
him
to
Acts25:22
Then
Agrippa
said
unto
Festus,
I
would
also
hear
the
man
To
said
thou
shalt
hear
Acts25:23
And
on
the
when
Agrippa
was
and
with
great
and
was
entered
into
the
place
of
with
t
he
chief
and
principal
men
of
the
at
Festus'
commandment
Paul
was
brought
Acts25:24
And
Festus
King
and
all
men
which
are
here
present
with
ye
see
this
about
whom
all
the
multitude
of
the
Jews
have
dealt
with
both
at
and
also
crying
that
he
ought
not
to
live
any
Acts25:25
But
when
I
found
that
he
had
committed
nothing
worthy
of
and
that
he
himself
hath
appealed
to

have
det
ermined
to
send

Of

I
have
no

I
have
brought
him
forth
before
and
specially
befor

O
king
after
examination
I
might
have
somewhat
to
Acts25:27
For
it
seemeth
to
me
unreasonable
to
send
a

not
withal
to
signify
the
crimes
laid
against
Acts26:1
Then
Agrippa
said
unto
Thou
art
permitted
to
speak
for
Then
Paul
stretched
forth
the
and
answered
for
Acts26:2
I
think
myself
king
because
I
shall
answer
for
myself
this
day
before
thee
touching
all
the
things
whereof
I
am
accused
of
the
Acts26:3
Especially
because
I
know
thee
to
be
expert
in
all
customs
and
questions
which
are
among
the

I
beseech
the

to
hear

manner
of
life
from
my

the
first

Which
knew
me
from
the

they
would

after
the
most
straitest
sect
of
our
religion
I
lived
a
Phar

Acts26:6
And
now
I
stand
and
am
judged
for
the
hope
of
the
promise
made
of
God
unto
our
Acts26:7
Unto
which
promise
our
twelve
instantly
serving
God

and
hope
to
For
which
hope's
king
Agrip
I
am
accused
of
the
Acts26:8
Why
should
it
be
thought
a
thing
incredible
with
that
God
should
raise
the
Acts26:9
I
verily
thought
with
that
I
ought
to
do
many
things
contrary
to
the
name
of
Jesus
of
Acts26:10
Which
thing
I
also
did
in
and
many
of
the
saints
did
I
shut
up
in
having
received
authority
from
the
c
hief
and
when
they
were
put
to
I
gave
my
voice
against
Acts26:11
And
I
punished
them
oft
in
every
and
compelled
them
to
and
being
exceedingly
mad
against

pe
rsecuted
them
even
unto
strange
Acts26:12
Whereupon
as
I
went
to
Damascus
with
authority
and
commission
from
the
chief
Acts26:13
At
O
I
saw
in
the
way
a
light
from
above
the
brightness
of
the
shining
round
about
me
and
them
which
journeyed
with
Acts26:14
And
when
we
were
all
fallen
to
the
I
heard
a
voice
speaking
unto
and
saying
in
the
Hebrew
why
persecutest
thou
it
is
hard
for
thee
to
kick
against
the
Acts26:15
And
I
Who
art
And
he
I
am
Jesus
whom
thou
persecutest.
Acts26:16
But
and
stand
upon
thy
for
I
have
appeared
unto
thee
for
this
to
make
thee
a
minister
and
a
witness
both
of
these
things
which
thou
hast
and
of
those
things
in
the
which
I
will
appear
unto
Acts26:17
Delivering
thee
from
the
and
from
the
unto
whom
now
I
send
Acts26:18
To
open
their
and
to
turn
them
from
darkness
to
and
from
the
power
of
Satan
unto
that
they
may
receive
forgiveness
of
and
inheritance
among
them
which
are
sanctified
by
faith
that
is
in
Acts26:19
O
king
I
was
not
disobedient
unto
the
heavenly
Acts26:20
But
shewed
first
unto
them
of
and
at
and
throughout
all
the
coasts
of
and
then
to
the
Gentil
es,
that
they
should
repent
and
turn
to
and
do
works
meet
for
Acts26:21
For
these
causes
the
Jews
caught
me
in
the
and
went
about
to
kill
Acts26:22
Having
therefore
obtained
help
of
I
continue
unto
this
witnessing
both
to
small
and
saying
none
other
th
ings
than
those
which
the
prophets
and
Moses
did
say
should
Acts26:23
That
Christ
should
and
that
he
should
be
the
first
that
should
rise
from
the
and
should
shew
light
unto
the
and
to
the
Acts26:24
And
as
he
thus
spake
for
Festus
said
with
a
loud

art
beside
much
learning

make
t
hee
Acts26:25
But
he
I
am
not
most
noble
Festus;
but
speak
forth
the
words
of
truth
and
Acts26:26
For
the
king
knoweth
of
these
before
whom
also
I
speak
for
I
am
persuaded
that
none
of
these
things
are
h
idden
from

this
thing
was
not
done
in
a
Acts26:27
King
believest
thou

know
that
thou
believest.
Acts26:28
Then
Agrippa
said
unto
Almost
thou
persuadest
me
to
be
a
Acts26:29
And
Paul
I
would
to
that
not
only
but
also
all
that
hear
me

were
both
and
altogether
s
uch
as
I
except
these
Acts26:30
And
when
he
had
thus
the
king
rose
and
the
and
and
they
that
sat
with
Acts26:31
And
when
they
were
gone
they
talked
between
This
man
doeth
nothing
worthy
of
death
or
of
bonds
.
Acts26:32
Then
said
Agrippa
unto
Festus,
This
man
might
have
been
set
at
if
he
had
not
appealed
unto
Acts27:1
And
when
it
was
determined
that
we
should
sail
into
they
delivered
Paul
and
certain
other
prisoners
unto
one
named
a
centurion
of
Acts27:2
And
entering
into
a
ship
of
Adramyttium,
we
meaning
to
sail
by
the
coasts
of
one
a
Macedonian
of
Thessalonica,
being
with
Acts27:3
And
the
next
day
we
touched
at
And
Julius
courteously
entreated
and
gave
him
liberty
to
go
unto
his
friends
t
o
refresh
Acts27:4
And
when
we
had
launched
from
we
sailed
under
because
the
winds
were
Acts27:5
And
when
we
had
sailed
over
the
sea
of
Cilicia
and
we
came
to
a
city
of
Acts27:6
And
there
the
centurion
found
a
ship
of
Alexandria
sailing
into
and
he
put
us
Acts27:7
And
when
we
had
sailed
slowly
many
and
scarce
were
come
over
against
the
wind
not
suffering
we
sailed
un
der
over
against
Salmone;
Acts27:8
hardly
passing
came
unto
a
place
which
is
called
The
fair
nigh
whereunto
was
the
city
of
Lasea.
Acts27:9
Now
when
much
time
was
and
when
sailing
was
now
because
the
fast
was
now
already
Paul
admonished
t
Acts27:10
And
said
unto
I
perceive
that
this
voyage
will
be
with
hurt
and
much
not
only
of
the
lading
and
but
also
of
our
Acts27:11
Nevertheless
the
centurion
believed
the
master
and
the
owner
of
the
more
than
those
things
which
were
spoken
by
Pau
l.
Acts27:12
And
because
the
haven
was
not
commodious
to
winter
the
more
part
advised
to
depart
thence
if
by
any
means
they
might
attain
to
Phenice,
and
there
to
which
is
an
haven
of
and
lieth
toward
the
south
west
and
north
Acts27:13
And
when
the
south
wind
blew
supposing
that
they
had
obtained
their
loosing
they
sailed
close
by
Acts27:14
But
not
long
after
there
arose
against
it
a
tempestuous
called
Acts27:15
And
when
the
ship
was
and
could
not
bear
up
into
the
we
let
her
Acts27:16
And
running
under
a
certain
island
which
is
called
Clauda,
we
had
much
work
to
come
by
the
Acts27:17
Which
when
they
had
taken
they
used
undergirding
the
fearing
lest
they
should
fall
into
the
quicksa
nds,
strake
and
so
were
Acts27:18
And
we
being
exceedingly
tossed
with
a
the
next
day
they
lightened
the
Acts27:19
And
the
third
day
we
cast
out
with
our
own
hands
the
tackling
of
the
Acts27:20
And
when
neither
sun
nor
stars
in
many
days
and
no
small
tempest
lay
on
all
hope
that
we
should
be
saved
wa
s
then
taken
Acts27:21
But
after
long
abstinence
Paul
stood
forth
in
the
midst
of
and
ye
should
have
hearkened
unto
and
no
t
have
loosed
from
and
to
have
gained
this
harm
and
Acts27:22
And
now
I
exhort
you
to
be
of
good
for
there
shall
be
no
loss
of
any
man's
life
among
but
of
the
Acts27:23
For
there
stood
by
me
this
night
the
angel
of
whose
I
and
whom
I

Fear
thou
must
be
brought
before
God
hath
given
thee
all
them
that
sail
with
Acts27:25
be
of
good
for
I
believe
that
it
shall
be
even
as
it
was
told
Acts27:26
Howbeit
we
must
be
cast
upon
a
certain
Acts27:27
But
when
the
fourteenth
night
was
as
we
were
driven
up
and
down
in
Adria,
about
midnight
the
shipmen
deemed
that
th
ey
drew
near
to
some
Acts27:28
And
and
found
it
twenty
and
when
they
had
gone
a
little
they
sounded
and
found
it
fifte
en
Acts27:29
Then
fearing
lest
we
should
have
fallen
upon
they
cast
four
anchors
out
of
the
and
wished
for
the
Acts27:30
And
as
the
shipmen
were
about
to
flee
out
of
the
when
they
had
let
down
the
boat
into
the
under
colour
as
thou

they
would
have
cast
anchors
out
of

foreship,

Paul
said
to
the
centurion
and
to
the
Except
these
abide
in
the

cannot
be

Then
the
soldiers
cut
off
the
ropes
of
the
and
let
her
fall
Acts27:33
And
while
the
day
was
coming
Paul
besought
them
all
to
take
This
day
is
the
fourteenth
day

have
tarried
and
continued

when

began
to

Then
were
they
all
of

and
they
also
took
some

And
we
were
in

sixteen

And
when
they

they
lightened

And
when
it

they
were

the
counsel
was
to

But
the

so
it
came
to
that

And
when

they
knew
that

And
the
barbarous
people
shewed
us
no

And
when
Paul

came
a

And
when

In

possessions
of

of

name
was
Publius;
who
received

lodged
us
three
days

And
it
came
to
that
the
father
of
Publius
lay
sick
of
a
fever
and
of
a
bloody

Paul
entered

also
honoured

with
many

when

with
such
things
as
were

And
after
three
months
we
departed
in

tarried

came

and
after

we
came

next

to
Puteoli:
Acts28:14
Where
we
found
and
were
desired
to
tarry
with
them
seven
and
so
we
went
toward
Acts28:15
And
from
when
the
brethren
heard
of

came
to
meet
us
as
far
as
Appii
and
The
three
whom
w

Paul
he
thanked
and
took

And
when
we

Paul
was
suffered
to

himself
with
a
soldier
that
kept

And
it
came
to
that
after
three
days
Paul
called
the
chief
of
the
Jews
and
when
they
were
come
he
said
unto
Men
and
though
I
have
committed
nothing
against
the

customs
of

when
they
had
examined

have
let
me

there
was
no
cause
of
death
in
Acts28:19
But
when
the
Jews
spake
against

was
constrained
to
appeal
unto
not
that
I
had
ought
to
accuse
my
nation
Acts28:20
For
this
cause
therefore
have
I
called
for
to
see
and
to
speak
with

that
for
the
hope
of
Israel
I
am
bound

And
they
said
unto
We
neither
received
letters
out
of
Judaea
concerning
neither
any
of
the
brethren
that
came
shewed
or
spake
any
harm
of
Acts28:22
But
we
desire
to
hear
of
thee
what
thou
thinkest:
for

concerning

we
know

And
when
they
had
appointed
him

came
many
to
him
into
his
to
whom
he
expounded
and
testified
the
ki

of
persuading
them
concerning

out
of

law

out
of

from
morning
till

And
some
believed
the
things
which
were
and
some
believed
Acts28:25
And
when
they
agreed
not
among
they
after
that
Paul
had
spoken
one
Well

Holy

Esaias

For
the

of

And
when

had
said
these

Jews
and
had
great
reasoning
among

And
Paul
dwelt
two
whole
years
in

received
all
that
came

Preaching
the

of

teaching
those
things
which
concern
the
Lord
Jesus
with
all
no
man
forbidding
Rom1:1
a
servant
of
Jesus
called
to
be
an
separated
unto
the
gospel
of
Rom1:2
(Which
he
had
promised
afore
by
his
prophets
in
the
holy
scriptures,)
Rom1:3
Concerning
his
Son
Jesus
Christ
our
which
was
made
of
the
seed
of
David
according
to
the
Rom1:4
And
declared
to
be
the
Son
of
God
with
according
to
the
spirit
of
by
the
resurrection
from

Rom1:5
By
whom
we
have
received
grace
and
for
obedience
to
the
faith
among
all
for
his
Rom1:6
Among
whom
are
ye
also

called
of

Rom1:7
To
all
that

called
to

Grace
to
you
and
peace
from
God
our
and
the
Lord
Jesus
Rom1:8
I
thank
my
God
through
Jesus
Christ
for
you
that
your
faith
is
spoken
of
throughout
the
whole
Rom1:9
For
God
is
my
whom
I
serve
with
my
spirit
in
the
gospel
of
his
that
without
ceasing
I
make
mention
of
you
alwa
ys
in
my
Rom1:10
Making
if
by
any
means
now
at
length
I
might
have
a
prosperous
journey
by
the
will
of
God
to
come
unto
Rom1:11
For
I
long
to
see
that
I
may
impart
unto
you
some
spiritual
to
the
end
ye
may
be
Rom1:12
That
that
I
may
be
comforted
together
with
you
by
the
mutual
faith
both
of
you
and
Rom1:13
Now
I
would
not
have
you
that
oftentimes
I
purposed
to
come
unto
(but
was
let
hitherto,)
that
I
mi
ght
have
some
fruit
among
you
even
as
among
other
Rom1:14
I
am
debtor
both
to
the
and
to
the
both
to
the
and
to
the
Rom1:15
as
much
as
in
me
I
am
ready
to
preach
the
gospel
to
you
that
are
at
Rome
Rom1:16
For
I
am
not
ashamed
of
the
gospel
of
for
it
is
the
power
of
God
unto
salvation
to
every
one
that
believeth;
to
the
Jew
and
also
to
the
Rom1:17
For
therein
is
the
righteousness
of
God
revealed
from
faith
to
as
it
is
The
just
shall
live
by
Rom1:18
For
the
wrath
of
God
is
revealed
from
heaven
against
all
ungodliness
and
unrighteousness
of
who
hold
the
truth
in
unri
ghteousness;
Rom1:19
Because
that
which
may
be
known
of
God
is
manifest
in
for
God
hath
shewed
it
unto
Rom1:20
For
the
invisible
things
of
him
from
the
creation
of
the
world
are
clearly
being
understood
by
the
things
that
are
ma
even
his
eternal
power
and
so
that
they
are
without
Rom1:21
Because
when
they
knew
they
glorified
him
not
as
neither
were
but
became
vain
in
their
imaginatio
ns,
and
their
foolish
heart
was
Rom1:22
Professing
themselves
to
be
they
became
Rom1:23
And
changed
the
glory
of
the
uncorruptible
God
into
an
image
made
like
to
corruptible
and
to
and
fourfooted
bea
sts,
and
creeping
Rom1:24
Wherefore
God
also
gave
them
up
to
uncleanness
through
the
lusts
of
their
own
to
dishonour
their
own
bodies
between
Rom1:25
Who
changed
the
truth
of
God
into
a
and
worshipped
and
served
the
creature
more
than
the
who
is
blessed
for
e
ver.
Rom1:26
For
this
cause
God
gave
them
up
unto
vile
for
even
their
women
did
change
the
natural
use
into
that
which
is
ag
ainst
Rom1:27
And
likewise
also
the
leaving
the
natural
use
of
the
burned
in
their
lust
one
toward
men
with
men
work
ing
that
which
is
and
receiving
in
themselves
that
recompence
of
their
error
which
was
Rom1:28
And
even
as
they
did
not
like
to
retain
God
in
their
God
gave
them
over
to
a
reprobate
to
do
those
things
which
are
not
Rom1:29
Being
filled
with
all
full
of
whisperers,
Rom1:30
Backbiters,
haters
of
inventors
of
evil
disobedient
to
Rom1:31
Without
covenantbreakers,
without
natural
Rom1:32
Who
knowing
the
judgment
of
that
they
which
commit
such
things
are
worthy
of
not

have
ple

in
them
that

Therefore
thou
art
O
whosoever
thou
art
that
judgest:
for
wherein
thou
judgest
thou
condemnest
th

for
thou
that
judgest
doest
the
same
Rom2:2
But
we
are
sure
that
the
judgment
of
God
is
according
to
truth
against
them
which
commit
such
Rom2:3
And
thinkest
thou
O
that
judgest
them
which
do
such
and
doest
the
that
thou
shalt
escape
the
judgme

of
Rom2:4
Or
despisest
thou
the
riches
of
his
goodness
and
forbearance
and
longsuffering;
not
knowing
that
the
goodness
of
God
leadeth
thee
to
Rom2:5
But
after
thy
hardness
and
impenitent
heart
treasurest
up
unto
thyself
wrath
against
the
day
of
wrath
and
revelation
of
the
righteous
judgment
of
Rom2:6
Who
will
render
to
every
man
according
to
his
Rom2:7
To
them
who
by
patient
continuance
in
well
doing
seek
for
glory
and
honour
and
eternal
Rom2:8
But
unto
them
that
are
and
do
not
obey
the
but
obey
indignation
and
Rom2:9
Tribulation
and
upon
every
soul
of
man
that
doeth
of
the
Jew
and
also
of
the
Rom2:10
But
and
to
every
man
that
worketh
to
the
Jew
and
also
to
the
Rom2:11
For
there
is
no
respect
of
persons
with
Rom2:12
For
as
many
as
have
sinned
without
law
shall
also
perish
without
and
as
many
as
have
sinned
in
the
law
shall
be
judged
by
the
Rom2:13
(For
not
the
hearers
of
the
law
are
just
before
but
the
doers
of

For
when
the
which

the
things
contained

their

Rom2:16
In
the
day
when
God
shall
judge
the
secrets
of
men
by
Jesus
Christ
according
to
my
Rom2:17
thou
art
called

restest
in

makest
thy

And
knowest
his
and
approvest
the
things
that
are

being
instructed
out
of

And
art
confident
that
thou
thyself
art
a
guide
of
the
a
light
of
them
which
are
in
Rom2:20
An
instructor
of

a
teacher
of
which
hast
the
form
of
knowledge
and
of
the
truth
in

Thou

Thou

acrilege?
Rom2:23
Thou
that
makest
thy
boast
of

through
breaking
the
law
dishonourest
thou
Rom2:24
For
the
name
of
God
is
blasphemed
among
the
Gentiles
through
as
it
is
Rom2:25
For
circumcision
verily
profiteth,
if
thou
keep

but
if
thou
be
a
breaker
of

thy
circumcision
is
made
unci
rcumcision.
Rom2:26
Therefore
if
the
uncircumcision
keep
the
righteousness
of
the
shall
not
his
uncircumcision
be
counted
for
circumcision
?
Rom2:27
And
shall
not
uncircumcision
which
is
by
if
it
fulfil
the
judge
who
by
the
letter
and
circumcision
dost
transgress

Rom2:28
For
he
is
not
a
which
is
one
neither
is
that
which
is
outward
in
the
Rom2:29
But
he
is
a
which
is
one
and
circumcision
is
that
of
the
in
the
and
not
in
the
whose
praise
is
not
of
but
of
Rom3:1
What
advantage
then
hath
the
or
what
profit
is
there
of
Rom3:2
Much
every
because
that
unto
them
were
committed
the
oracles
of

For
what
if
some
did

their
unbelief
make
the
faith
of
God
without

God
let

a
as
it
is
That
thou
mightest
be
justified
in

But
if

unrighteousness
commend
the
righteousness
of

shall
we
Is
God
unrighteous
who
taketh
(I
speak
as
a
Rom3:6
God
for
then
how
shall
God
judge
the
Rom3:7
For
if
the
truth
of
God
hath
more
abounded
through
my
lie
unto
his
why
yet
am
I
also
judged
as
a

And
not
(as
we
be
slanderously
and
as
some
affirm
that
we
say,)
Let
us
do
that
good
may
whose
damnation
is
Rom3:9
What
are
we
better
than
in
no
for
we
have
before
proved
both
Jews
and
that
they
are
all
unde

Rom3:10
As
it
is
There
is
none
not
Rom3:11
There
is
none
that
understandeth,
there
is
none
that
seeketh
after
Rom3:12
They
are
all
gone
out
of
the
they
are
together
become
there
is
none
that
doeth
not
Rom3:13
Their
throat
is
an
open
with
their
tongues
they
have
used
the
poison
of
asps
is
under
their
Rom3:14
Whose
mouth
is
full
of
cursing
and
Rom3:15
Their
feet
are
swift
to
shed
Rom3:16
Destruction
and
misery
are
in
their

And
the
way
of
peace
have
they
not
Rom3:18
There
is
no
fear
of
God
before

Now
we
know
that
what
things
soever
the
law
it
saith
to
them
who
are
under

that
every
mouth
may
be

all

Therefore
by
the
deeds
of

shall
no

be
justified
in
his
for
by
the
law
is
the
knowledge
of
Rom3:21
But
now
the
righteousness
of
God
without
the
law
is
being
witnessed
by
the
law
and
the
Rom3:22
Even
the
righteousness
of
God
which
is
by
faith
of
Jesus
Christ
unto
all
and
upon
all
them
that
for
there
is
no
di
fference:
Rom3:23
For
all
have
and
come
short
of
the
glory
of
Rom3:24
Being
justified
freely
by
his
grace
through
the
redemption
that
is
in
Christ
Rom3:25
Whom
God
hath
set
forth
to
be
a
propitiation
through
faith
in
his
to
declare
his
righteousness
for
the
remission
of
sins
that
are
through
the
forbearance
of
Rom3:26
To
I
at
this
time
his
that
he
might
be
and
the
justifier
of
him
which
believeth
in
Jesus
.
Rom3:27
Where
is
boasting
It
is
By
what
of
but
by
the
law
of
Rom3:28
Therefore
we
conclude
that
a
man
is
justified
by
faith
without
the
deeds
of
the
Rom3:29
Is
he
the
God
of
the
Jews
is
he
not
also
of
the
of
the
Gentiles
Rom3:30
Seeing
it
is
one
which
shall
justify
the
circumcision
by
and
uncircumcision
through
Rom3:31
Do
we
then
make
void
the
law
through
God
we
establish
the
Rom4:1
What
shall
we
say
then
that
Abraham
our
as
pertaining
to
the
hath
Rom4:2
For
if
Abraham
were
justified
by
he
hath
whereof
to
but
not
before
Rom4:3
For
what
saith
the
Abraham
believed
and
it
was
counted
unto
him
for
Rom4:4
Now
to
him
that
worketh
is
the
reward
not
reckoned
of
but
of
Rom4:5
But
to
him
that
worketh
but
believeth
on
him
that
justifieth
the
his
faith
is
counted
for
Rom4:6
Even
as
David
also
describeth
the
blessedness
of
the
unto
whom
God
imputeth
righteousness
without
Rom4:7
Blessed
are
they
whose
iniquities
are
and
whose
sins
are
Rom4:8
Blessed
is
the
man
to
whom
the
Lord
will
not
impute
Rom4:9
Cometh
this
blessedness
then
upon
the
circumcision
or
upon
the
uncircumcision
for
we
say
that
faith
was
reckoned
to
Abraham
for
Rom4:10
How
was
it
then
when
he
was
in
or
in
Not
in
but
in
Rom4:11
And
he
received
the
sign
of
a
seal
of
the
righteousness
of
the
faith
which
he
had
yet
being
th
at
he
might
be
the
father
of
all
them
that
though
they
be
not
that
righteousness
might
be
imputed
unto
them
a
lso:
Rom4:12
And
the
father
of
circumcision
to
them
who
are
not
of
the
circumcision
but
who
also
walk
in
the
steps
of
that
faith
o
f
our
father
which
he
had
being
yet
Rom4:13
For
the
that
he
should
be
the
heir
of
the
was
not
to
or
to
his
through
the
but
through
the
righteousness
of
Rom4:14
For
if
they
which
are
of
the
law
be
faith
is
made
and
the
promise
made
of
none
Rom4:15
Because
the
law
worketh
for
where
no
law
there
is
no
Rom4:16
Therefore
it
is
of
that
it
might
be
by
to
the
end
the
promise
might
be
sure
to
all
the
not
to
that
only
which
is
of
the
but
to
that
also
which
is
of
the
faith
of
who
is
the
father
of
us
Rom4:17
(As
it
is
I
have
made
thee
a
father
of
many
nations,)
before
him
whom
he
even
who
quickeneth
the
de
and
calleth
those
things
which
be
not
as
though
they
Rom4:18
Who
against
hope
believed
in
that
he
might
become
the
father
of
many
according
to
that
which
was
So
shall
thy
seed
Rom4:19
And
being
not
weak
in
he
considered
not
his
own
body
now
when
he
was
about
an
hundred
years
neither
yet
t
he
deadness
of
Sarah's
Rom4:20
He
staggered
not
at
the
promise
of
God
through
but
was
strong
in
giving
glory
to
Rom4:21
And
being
fully
persuaded
what
he
had
he
was
able
also
to
Rom4:22
And
therefore
it
was
imputed
to
him
for
Rom4:23
Now
it
was
not
written
for
his
sake
that
it
was
imputed
to
Rom4:24
But
for
us
to
whom
it
shall
be
if
we
believe
on
him
that
raised
up
Jesus
our
Lord
from
the
Rom4:25
Who
was
delivered
for
our
and
was
raised
again
for
our
Rom5:1
Therefore
being
justified
by
we
have
peace
with
God
through
our
Lord
Jesus
Rom5:2
By
whom
also
we
have
access
by
faith
into
this
grace
wherein
we
and
rejoice
in
hope
of
the
glory
of
Rom5:3
And
not
only
but
we
glory
in
tribulations
knowing
that
tribulation
worketh
Rom5:4
And
and
Rom5:5
And
hope
maketh
not
because
the
love
of
God
is
shed
abroad
in
our
hearts
by
the
Holy
Ghost
which
is
given
unto
Rom5:6
For
when
we
were
yet
without
in
due
time
Christ
died
for
the
Rom5:7
For
scarcely
for
a
righteous
man
will
one
yet
peradventure
for
a
good
man
some
would
even
dare
to
Rom5:8
But
God
commendeth
his
love
toward
in
while
we
were
yet
Christ
died
for
Rom5:9
Much
more
being
now
justified
by
his
we
shall
be
saved
from
wrath
through
Rom5:10
For
when
we
were
we
were
reconciled
to
God
by
the
death
of
his
much
being
we
shall
be
s
aved
by
his
Rom5:11
And
not
only
but
we
also
joy
in
God
through
our
Lord
Jesus
by
whom
we
have
now
received
the
Rom5:12
as
by
one
man
sin
entered
into
the
and
death
by
and
so
death
passed
upon
all
for
that
all
have
Rom5:13
(For
until
the
law
sin
was
in
the
but
sin
is
not
imputed
when
there
is
no
Rom5:14
Nevertheless
death
reigned
from
Adam
to
even
over
them
that
had
not
sinned
after
the
similitude
of
Adam's
transgress
who
is
the
figure
of
him
that
was
to
Rom5:15
But
not
as
the
so
also
is
the
free
For
if
through
the
offence
of
one
many
be
much
more
the
grace
of
Go
d,
and
the
gift
by
which
is
by
one
Jesus
hath
abounded
unto
Rom5:16
And
not
as
it
was
by
one
that
so
is
the
for
the
judgment
was
by
one
to
but
the
free
gift
is
of
many
offences
unto
Rom5:17
For
if
by
one
man's
offence
death
reigned
by
much
more
they
which
receive
abundance
of
grace
and
of
the
gift
of
righte
ousness
shall
reign
in
life
by
Jesus
Christ.)
Rom5:18
Therefore
as
by
the
offence
of
one
judgment
came
upon
all
men
to
even
so
by
the
righteousness
of
one
the
free
gift
came
upon
all
men
unto
justification
of
Rom5:19
For
as
by
one
man's
disobedience
many
were
made
so
by
the
obedience
of
one
shall
many
be
made
Rom5:20
Moreover
the
law
that
the
offence
might
But
where
sin
grace
did
much
more
Rom5:21
That
as
sin
hath
reigned
unto
even
so
might
grace
reign
through
righteousness
unto
eternal
life
by
Jesus
Christ
our
Rom6:1
What
shall
we
say
Shall
we
continue
in
that
grace
may
Rom6:2
God
How
shall
that
are
dead
to
live
any
longer
Rom6:3
Know
ye
that
so
many
of
us
as
were
baptized
into
Jesus
Christ
were
baptized
into
his
Rom6:4
Therefore
we
are
buried
with
him
by
baptism
into
that
like
as
Christ
was
raised
up
from
the
dead
by
the
glory
of
the
even
so
we
also
should
walk
in
newness
of
Rom6:5
For
if
we
have
been
planted
together
in
the
likeness
of
his
we
shall
be
also
in
the
likeness
of
his
Rom6:6
Knowing
that
our
old
man
is
crucified
with
that
the
body
of
sin
might
be
that
henceforth
we
should
not
serve
Rom6:7
For
he
that
is
dead
is
freed
from
Rom6:8
Now
if
we
be
dead
with
we
believe
that
we
shall
also
live
with
Rom6:9
Knowing
that
Christ
being
raised
from
the
dead
dieth
no
death
hath
no
more
dominion
over
Rom6:10
For
in
that
he
he
died
unto
sin
but
in
that
he
he
liveth
unto
Rom6:11
Likewise
reckon
ye
also
yourselves
to
be
dead
indeed
unto
but
alive
unto
God
through
Jesus
Christ
our
Rom6:12
Let
not
sin
therefore
reign
in
your
mortal
that
ye
should
obey
it
in
the
lusts
Rom6:13
Neither
yield
ye
your
members
as
instruments
of
unrighteousness
unto
but
yield
yourselves
unto
as
those
that
are
alive
from
the
and
your
members
as
instruments
of
righteousness
unto
Rom6:14
For
sin
shall
not
have
dominion
over
for
ye
are
not
under
the
but
under
Rom6:15
What
shall
we
because
we
are
not
under
the
but
under
God
Rom6:16
Know
ye
that
to
whom
ye
yield
yourselves
servants
to
his
servants
ye
are
to
whom
ye
whether
of
sin
unto
de
ath,
or
of
obedience
unto
Rom6:17
But
God
be
that
ye
were
the
servants
of
but
ye
have
obeyed
from
the
heart
that
form
of
doctrine
which
was
del
ivered
Rom6:18
Being
then
made
free
from
ye
became
the
servants
of
Rom6:19
I
speak
after
the
manner
of
men
because
of
the
infirmity
of
your
for
as
ye
have
yielded
your
members
servants
to
unc
leanness
and
to
iniquity
unto
even
so
now
yield
your
members
servants
to
righteousness
unto
Rom6:20
For
when
ye
were
the
servants
of
ye
were
free
from
Rom6:21
What
fruit
had
ye
then
in
those
things
whereof
ye
are
now
for
the
end
of
those
things
is
Rom6:22
But
now
being
made
free
from
and
become
servants
to
ye
have
your
fruit
unto
and
the
end
everlasting
lif
e.
Rom6:23
For
the
wages
of
sin
is
but
the
gift
of
God
is
eternal
life
through
Jesus
Christ
our
Rom7:1
Know
ye
(for
I
speak
to
them
that
know
the
law,)
how
that
the
law
hath
dominion
over
a
man
as
long
as
he
live
Rom7:2
For
the
woman
which
hath
an
husband
is
bound
by
the
law
to
her
husband
so
long
as
he
but
if
the
husband
be
she
is
loosed
from
the
law
of
her
Rom7:3
So
then
while
her
husband
she
be
married
to
another
she
shall
be
called
an
but
if
her
husband
b
e
she
is
free
from
that
so
that
she
is
no
though
she
be
married
to
another
Rom7:4
my
ye
also
are
become
dead
to
the
law
by
the
body
of
that
ye
should
be
married
to
even
to
him
who
is
raised
from
the
that
we
should
bring
forth
fruit
unto
Rom7:5
For
when
we
were
in
the
the
motions
of
which
were
by
the
did
work
in
our
members
to
bring
forth
fruit
unto
Rom7:6
But
now
we
are
delivered
from
the
that
being
dead
wherein
we
were
that
we
should
serve
in
newness
of
and
not
in
the
oldness
of
the
Rom7:7
What
shall
we
say
Is
the
law
God
I
had
not
known
but
by
the
for
I
had
not
known
exce
pt
the
law
had
Thou
shalt
not
Rom7:8
But
taking
occasion
by
the
wrought
in
me
all
manner
of
For
without
the
law
sin
was
Rom7:9
For
I
was
alive
without
the
law
but
when
the
commandment
sin
and
I
Rom7:10
And
the
which
was
ordained
to
I
found
to
be
unto
Rom7:11
For
taking
occasion
by
the
deceived
and
by
it
slew
Rom7:12
Wherefore
the
law
is
and
the
commandment
and
and
Rom7:13
Was
then
that
which
is
good
made
death
unto
God
But
that
it
might
appear
working
death
in
me
by
that
which
is
that
sin
by
the
commandment
might
become
exceeding
Rom7:14
For
we
know
that
the
law
is
but
I
am
sold
under
Rom7:15
For
that
which
I
do
I
allow
for
what
I
that
do
I
but
what
I
that
do
Rom7:16
If
then
I
do
that
which
I
would
I
consent
unto
the
law
that
it
is
Rom7:17
Now
then
it
is
no
more
I
that
do
but
sin
that
dwelleth
in
Rom7:18
For
I
know
that
in
me
(that
in
my
flesh,)
dwelleth
no
good
for
to
will
is
present
with
but
how
to
perform
th
at
which
is
good
I
find
Rom7:19
For
the
good
that
I
would
I
do
but
the
evil
which
I
would
that
I
Rom7:20
Now
if
I
do
that
I
would
it
is
no
more
I
that
do
but
sin
that
dwelleth
in
Rom7:21
I
find
then
a
when
I
would
do
evil
is
present
with
Rom7:22
For
I
delight
in
the
law
of
God
after
the
inward
Rom7:23
But
I
see
another
law
in
my
warring
against
the
law
of
my
and
bringing
me
into
captivity
to
the
law
of
sin
w
hich
is
in
my
Rom7:24
O
wretched
man
that
I
who
shall
deliver
me
from
the
body
of
this
Rom7:25
I
thank
God
through
Jesus
Christ
our
So
then
with
the
mind
I
myself
serve
the
law
of
but
with
the
flesh
the
law
of
Rom8:1
There
is
therefore
now
no
condemnation
to
them
which
are
in
Christ
who
walk
not
after
the
but
after
the
Spirit
.
Rom8:2
For
the
law
of
the
Spirit
of
life
in
Christ
Jesus
hath
made
me
free
from
the
law
of
sin
and
Rom8:3
For
what
the
law
could
not
in
that
it
was
weak
through
the
God
sending
his
own
Son
in
the
likeness
of
sinful
fles
h,
and
for
condemned
sin
in
the
Rom8:4
That
the
righteousness
of
the
law
might
be
fulfilled
in
who
walk
not
after
the
but
after
the
Rom8:5
For
they
that
are
after
the
flesh
do
mind
the
things
of
the
but
they
that
are
after
the
Spirit
the
things
of
the
Spir
Rom8:6
For
to
be
carnally
minded
is
but
to
be
spiritually
minded
is
life
and
Rom8:7
Because
the
carnal
mind
is
enmity
against
for
it
is
not
subject
to
the
law
of
neither
indeed
can
Rom8:8
So
then
they
that
are
in
the
flesh
cannot
please
Rom8:9
But
ye
are
not
in
the
but
in
the
if
so
be
that
the
Spirit
of
God
dwell
in
Now
if
any
man
have
not
the
Sp
irit
of
he
is
none
of
Rom8:10
And
if
Christ
be
in
the
body
is
dead
because
of
but
the
Spirit
is
life
because
of
Rom8:11
But
if
the
Spirit
of
him
that
raised
up
Jesus
from
the
dead
dwell
in
he
that
raised
up
Christ
from
the
dead
shall
also
quicken
your
mortal
bodies
by
his
Spirit
that
dwelleth
in
Rom8:12
we
are
not
to
the
to
live
after
the
Rom8:13
For
if
ye
live
after
the
ye
shall
but
if
ye
through
the
Spirit
do
mortify
the
deeds
of
the
ye
shall
Rom8:14
For
as
many
as
are
led
by
the
Spirit
of
they
are
the
sons
of
Rom8:15
For
ye
have
not
received
the
spirit
of
bondage
again
to
but
ye
have
received
the
Spirit
of
whereby
we
Rom8:16
The
Spirit
itself
beareth
witness
with
our
that
we
are
the
children
of
Rom8:17
And
if
then
heirs
of
and
joint-heirs
with
if
so
be
that
we
suffer
with
that
we
may
be
al
so
glorified
Rom8:18
For
I
reckon
that
the
sufferings
of
this
present
time
are
not
worthy
to
be
compared
with
the
glory
which
shall
be
revealed
in
Rom8:19
For
the
earnest
expectation
of
the
creature
waiteth
for
the
manifestation
of
the
sons
of
Rom8:20
For
the
creature
was
made
subject
to
not
but
by
reason
of
him
who
hath
subjected

I
say
that
Jesus
Christ
was
a
minister
of
the
circumcision
for
the
truth
of
to
confirm
the
promises
made
unto
the
Rom15:9
And
that
the
Gentiles
might
glorify
God
for
his
as
it
is
For
this
cause
I
will
confess
to
thee
among

the

I
have
written
the
more
boldly
unto
you
in
some
as
putting
you
in
because
of
the
grace
that
is
given
to
me
of
Rom15:16
That
I
should
be
the
minister
of
Jesus
Christ
to
the
ministering

gospel
of
that
the
offering
up
of
the
Gentiles
might
be
being
sanctified
by
the
Holy
Rom15:17
I
have
therefore
whereof
I
may
glory
through
Jesus
Christ
in
those
things
which
pertain
to
Rom15:18
For
I
will
not
dare
to
speak
of
any
of
those
things
which
Christ
hath
not
wrought
by
to
make
the
Gentiles
by
word
and
Rom15:19
Through
mighty
signs
and
by
the
power
of
the
Spirit
of
so
that
from
and
round
about
unto
Illyricu
m,
I
have
fully
preached
the
gospel
of
Rom15:20
so
have
I
strived
to
preach
the
not
where
Christ
was
lest
I
should
build
upon
another
man's
foundation
:
Rom15:21
But
as
it
is
To
whom
he
was
not
spoken
they
shall

that

not
heard
shall
Rom15:22
For
which
cause
also
I
have
been
much
hindered
from
coming
to
Rom15:23
But
now
having
no
more
place
in
these
and
having
a
great
desire
these
many
years
to
come
unto
Rom15:24
Whensoever
I
take
my
journey
into
I
will
come
to

I
trust
to
see
you
in

to

way
thitherward

first
I
be
somewhat
filled
with
your
Rom15:25
But
now
I
go
unto
Jerusalem
to
minister
unto
the
Rom15:26
For
it
hath
pleased
them
of
Macedonia
and
Achaia
to
make
a
certain
contribution
for
the
poor
saints
which
are
at
Jerusalem
.
Rom15:27
It
hath
pleased
them
and
their
debtors
they
For
if
the
Gentiles
have
been
made
partakers
of
their
spiritual
t
hings,
their
duty
is
also
to
minister
unto
them
in
carnal
Rom15:28
When
therefore
I
have
performed
and
have
sealed
to
them
this
I
will
come
by
you
into
Rom15:29
And
I
am
sure
when
I
come
unto
I
shall
come
in
the
fulness
of
the
blessing
of
the
gospel
of
Rom15:30
Now
I
beseech
for
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ's
and
for
the
love
of
the
that
ye
strive
together
wit
h
me
in
your
prayers
to
God
for
Rom15:31
That
I
may
be
delivered
from
them
that
do
not
believe
in
and
that
my
service
which
I
have
for
Jerusalem
may
be
acc
epted
of
the
Rom15:32

I
may
come

you

joy

For
the

1Cor1:23
But
we
preach
Christ
unto
the
Jews
a
stumblingblock,
and
unto
the
Greeks
1Cor1:24
But
unto
them
which
are
both
Jews
and
Christ
the
power
of
and
the
wisdom
of
1Cor1:25
Because
the
foolishness
of
God
is
wiser
than
and
the
weakness
of
God
is
stronger
than
1Cor1:26
For
ye
see
your
how
that
not
many
wise
men
after
the
not
many
not
many
are
called
:
1Cor1:27
But
God
hath
chosen
the
foolish
things
of
the
world
to
confound
the
and
God
hath
chosen
the
weak
things
of
the
world
to
confound
the
things
which
are
1Cor1:28
And
base
things
of
the
and
things
which
are
hath
God
and
things
which
are
to
bring
to
n
ought
things
that
1Cor1:29
That
no
flesh
should
glory
in
his
1Cor1:30
But
of
him
are
ye
in
Christ
who
of
God
is
made
unto
us
and
and
and
redemptio
n:
1Cor1:31
according
as
it
is
He
that
glorieth,
let
him
glory
in
the
1Cor2:1
And
when
I
came
to
came
not
with
excellency
of
speech
or
of
declaring
unto
you
the
testimony
of
G
od.
1Cor2:2
For
I
determined
not
to
know
any
thing
among
save
Jesus
and
him
1Cor2:3
And
I
was
with
you
in
and
in
and
in
much
1Cor2:4
And
my
speech
and
my
preaching
was
not
with
enticing
words
of
man's
but
in
demonstration
of
the
Spirit
and
of
power
:
1Cor2:5
That
your
faith
should
not
stand
in
the
wisdom
of
but
in
the
power
of
1Cor2:6
Howbeit
we
speak
wisdom
among
them
that
are
yet
not
the
wisdom
of
this
nor
of
the
princes
of
this
th
at
come
to
1Cor2:7
But
we
speak
the
wisdom
of
God
in
a
even
the
hidden
which
God
ordained
before
the
world
unto
our
1Cor2:8
Which
none
of
the
princes
of
this
world
for
had
they
known
they
would
not
have
crucified
the
Lord
of
1Cor2:9
But
as
it
is
Eye
hath
not
nor
ear
neither
have
entered
into
the
heart
of
the
things
which
God
ha
th
prepared
for
them
that
love
1Cor2:10
But
God
hath
revealed
them
unto
us
by
his
for
the
Spirit
searcheth
all
the
deep
things
of
1Cor2:11
For
what
man
knoweth
the
things
of
a
save
the
spirit
of
man
which
is
in
even
so
the
things
of
God
knoweth
no
man
,
but
the
Spirit
of
1Cor2:12
Now
we
have
not
the
spirit
of
the
but
the
spirit
which
is
of
that
we
might
know
the
things
that
are
freely
given
to
us
of
1Cor2:13
Which
things
also
we
not
in
the
words
which
man's
wisdom
teacheth,
but
which
the
Holy
Ghost
teacheth;
comparing
spi
ritual
things
with
1Cor2:14
But
the
natural
man
receiveth
not
the
things
of
the
Spirit
of
for
they
are
foolishness
unto
neither
can
he
know
because
they
are
spiritually
1Cor2:15
But
he
that
is
spiritual
judgeth
all
yet
he
himself
is
judged
of
no
1Cor2:16
For
who
hath
known
the
mind
of
the
that
he
may
instruct
But
we
have
the
mind
of
1Cor3:1
And
could
not
speak
unto
you
as
unto
but
as
unto
even
as
unto
babes
in
1Cor3:2
I
have
fed
you
with
and
not
with
for
hitherto
ye
were
not
able
to
bear
neither
yet
now
are
ye
1Cor3:3
For
ye
are
yet
for
whereas
there
is
among
you
and
and
are
ye
not
and
walk
as
me
n?
1Cor3:4
For
while
one
I
am
of
and
I
am
of
Apollos;
are
ye
not
1Cor3:5
Who
then
is
and
who
is
Apollos,
but
ministers
by
whom
ye
even
as
the
Lord
gave
to
every
1Cor3:6
I
have
Apollos
but
God
gave
the
1Cor3:7
So
then
neither
is
he
that
planteth
any
neither
he
that
watereth;
but
God
that
giveth
the
1Cor3:8
Now
he
that
planteth
and
he
that
watereth
are
and
every
man
shall
receive
his
own
reward
according
to
his
own
1Cor3:9
For
we
are
labourers
together
with
ye
are
God's
ye
are
God's
1Cor3:10
According
to
the
grace
of
God
which
is
given
unto
as
a
wise
masterbuilder,
I
have
laid
the
and
another
bui
ldeth
But
let
every
man
take
heed
how
he
buildeth
1Cor3:11
For
other
foundation
can
no
man
lay
than
that
is
which
is
Jesus
1Cor3:12
Now
if
any
man
build
upon
this
foundation
precious
1Cor3:13
Every
man's
work
shall
be
made
for
the
day
shall
declare
because
it
shall
be
revealed
by
and
the
fire
shall
try
every
man's
work
of
what
sort
it
1Cor3:14
If
any
man's
work
abide
which
he
hath
built
he
shall
receive
a
1Cor3:15
If
any
man's
work
shall
be
he
shall
suffer
but
he
himself
shall
be
yet
so
as
by
1Cor3:16
Know
ye
not
that
ye
are
the
temple
of
and
that
the
Spirit
of
God
dwelleth
in
1Cor3:17
If
any
man
defile
the
temple
of
him
shall
God
for
the
temple
of
God
is
which
temple
ye
1Cor3:18
Let
no
man
deceive
If
any
man
among
you
seemeth
to
be
wise
in
this
let
him
become
a
that
he
may
be
w
ise.
1Cor3:19
For
the
wisdom
of
this
world
is
foolishness
with
For
it
is
He
taketh
the
wise
in
their
own
1Cor3:20
And
The
Lord
knoweth
the
thoughts
of
the
that
they
are
1Cor3:21
Therefore
let
no
man
glory
in
For
all
things
are
1Cor3:22
Whether
or
Apollos,
or
Cephas,
or
the
or
or
or
things
or
things
to
all
are
1Cor3:23
And
ye
are
Christ's;
and
Christ
is
1Cor4:1
Let
a
man
so
account
of
as
of
the
ministers
of
and
stewards
of
the
mysteries
of
1Cor4:2
Moreover
it
is
required
in
that
a
man
be
found
1Cor4:3
But
with
me
it
is
a
very
small
thing
that
I
should
be
judged
of
or
of
man's
I
judge
not
mine
own
1Cor4:4
For
I
know
nothing
by
yet
am
I
not
hereby
but
he
that
judgeth
me
is
the
1Cor4:5
Therefore
judge
nothing
before
the
until
the
Lord
who
both
will
bring
to
light
the
hidden
things
of
a
nd
will
make
manifest
the
counsels
of
the
and
then
shall
every
man
have
praise
of
1Cor4:6
And
these
I
have
in
a
figure
transferred
to
myself
and
to
Apollos
for
your
that
ye
might
learn
in
us
not
to
think
of
men
above
that
which
is
that
no
one
of
you
be
puffed
up
for
one
against
1Cor4:7
For
who
maketh
thee
to
differ
from
and
what
hast
thou
that
thou
didst
not
now
if
thou
didst
receive
w
hy
dost
thou
as
if
thou
hadst
not
received
1Cor4:8
Now
ye
are
now
ye
are
ye
have
reigned
as
kings
without
and
I
would
to
God
ye
did
that
we
also
might
reign
with
1Cor4:9
For
I
think
that
God
hath
set
forth
us
the
apostles
as
it
were
appointed
to
for
we
are
made
a
spectacle
unto
t
he
and
to
and
to
1Cor4:10
We
are
fools
for
Christ's
but
ye
are
wise
in
we
are
but
ye
are
ye
are
but
we
are
d
espised.
1Cor4:11
Even
unto
this
present
hour
we
both
and
and
are
and
are
and
have
no
certain
dwellingplace
;
1Cor4:12
And
working
with
our
own
being
we
being
we
suffer
1Cor4:13
Being
we
we
are
made
as
the
filth
of
the
and
are
the
offscouring
of
all
things
unto
this
1Cor4:14
I
write
not
these
things
to
shame
but
as
my
beloved
sons
I
warn
1Cor4:15
For
though
ye
have
ten
thousand
instructors
in
yet
have
ye
not
many
for
in
Christ
Jesus
I
have
begotten
y
ou
through
the
1Cor4:16
Wherefore
I
beseech
be
ye
followers
of
1Cor4:17
For
this
cause
have
I
sent
unto
you
Timotheus,
who
is
my
beloved
and
faithful
in
the
who
shall
bring
you
into
r
emembrance
of
my
ways
which
be
in
as
I
teach
every
where
in
every
1Cor4:18
Now
some
are
puffed
as
though
I
would
not
come
to
1Cor4:19
But
I
will
come
to
you
if
the
Lord
and
will
not
the
speech
of
them
which
are
puffed
but
the
power
.
1Cor4:20
For
the
kingdom
of
God
is
not
in
but
in
1Cor4:21
What
will
shall
I
come
unto
you
with
a
or
in
and
in
the
spirit
of
1Cor5:1
It
is
reported
commonly
that
there
is
fornication
among
and
such
fornication
as
is
not
so
much
as
named
among
the
Gent
iles,
that
one
should
have
his
father's
1Cor5:2
And
ye
are
puffed
and
have
not
rather
that
he
that
hath
done
this
deed
might
be
taken
away
from
among
1Cor5:3
For
I
as
absent
in
but
present
in
have
judged
as
though
I
were
concerning
him
that
hath
so
done
this
1Cor5:4
In
the
name
of
our
Lord
Jesus
when
ye
are
gathered
and
my
with
the
power
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
,
1Cor5:5
To
deliver
such
an
one
unto
Satan
for
the
destruction
of
the
that
the
spirit
may
be
saved
in
the
day
of
the
Lord
Jes
1Cor5:6
Your
glorying
is
not
Know
ye
not
that
a
little
leaven
leaveneth
the
whole
1Cor5:7
Purge
out
therefore
the
old
that
ye
may
be
a
new
as
ye
are
For
even
Christ
our
passover
is
sacrif
iced
for
1Cor5:8
Therefore
let
us
keep
the
not
with
old
neither
with
the
leaven
of
malice
and
but
with
the
unleav
ened
bread
of
sincerity
and
1Cor5:9
I
wrote
unto
you
in
an
epistle
not
to
company
with
1Cor5:10
Yet
not
altogether
with
the
fornicators
of
this
or
with
the
or
extortioners,
or
with
idolaters;
for
then
must
ye
needs
go
out
of
the
1Cor5:11
But
now
I
have
written
unto
you
not
to
keep
if
any
man
that
is
called
a
brother
be
a
or
or
an

a
or
a
or
an

such
an
one
no
not

1Cor5:12
For
what
have
I
to
do
to
judge
them
also
that
are
do
not
ye
judge
them
that
are
1Cor5:13
But
them
that
are
without
God
judgeth.
Therefore
put
away
from
among
yourselves
that
wicked
1Cor6:1
Dare
any
of
having
a
matter
against
go
to
law
before
the
and
not
before
the
1Cor6:2
Do
ye
not
know
that
the
saints
shall
judge
the

if
the
world
shall
be
judged
by

ye
unworthy
to
judge
the
smallest
1Cor6:3
Know
ye
not
that
we
shall
judge
how
much
more
things
that
pertain
to
this
1Cor6:4
If
then
ye
have
judgments
of
things
pertaining
to
this
set
them
to
judge
who
are
least
esteemed
in
the
1Cor6:5
I
speak
to
your

it
that
there
is
not
a
wise
man
among

that
shall
be
able
to
judge
between

1Cor6:6
But
brother
goeth
to
law
with
and
that
before
the
unbelievers.
1Cor6:7
Now
therefore
there
is
utterly
a
fault
among
because
ye
go
to
law
one
with
Why
do
ye
not
rather
take
w
hy
do
ye
not
rather
suffer
yourselves
to
be
1Cor6:8
ye
do
and
and
that

ye
not
that
the
unrighteous
shall
not
inherit
the
kingdom
of

not
neither
nor
idolaters,
nor
nor
nor
abusers
of
themselves
with
1Cor6:10
Nor
nor
nor
nor
revilers,
nor
extortioners,
shall
inherit
the
kingdom
of
1Cor6:11
And
such
were
some
of
but
ye
are
but
ye
are
but
ye
are
justified
in
the
name
of
the
Lord

the
Spirit
of

All
things

Now
the

is
not

for

Lord
for

And
God
hath
both
raised
up

also
raise
up

concerning

is
good
for
a

not

say
therefore
to
the
unmarried

is
good
for
them

But
if
they

better

him
not
become
Is
any
called
in
let
him
not
be
cir
cumcised.
1Cor7:19
Circumcision
is
and
uncircumcision
is
but
the
keeping
of
the
commandments
of
1Cor7:20
Let
every
man
abide
in
the
same
calling
wherein
he
was
1Cor7:21
Art
thou
called
being
a
care
not
for
but
if
thou
mayest
be
made
use
it
1Cor7:22
For
he
that
is
called
in
the
being
a
is
the
Lord's
likewise
also
he
that
is
being
is
Christ's
1Cor7:23
Ye
are
bought
with
a
be
not
ye
the
servants
of
1Cor7:24
let
every
wherein
he
is
therein
abide
with
1Cor7:25
Now
concerning
virgins
I
have
no
commandment
of
the
yet
I
give
my
as
one
that
hath
obtained
mercy
of
the
L
ord
to
be
1Cor7:26
I
suppose
therefore
that
this
is
good
for
the
present
I
that
it
is
good
for
a
man
so
to
1Cor7:27
Art
thou
bound
unto
a
seek
not
to
be
Art
thou
loosed
from
a
seek
not
a
1Cor7:28
But
and
if
thou
thou
hast
not
and
if
a
virgin
she
hath
not
Nevertheless
such
shall
have
trou
ble
in
the
but
I
spare
1Cor7:29
But
this
I
the
time
is
it
remaineth,
that
both
they
that
have
wives
be
as
though
they
had
1Cor7:30
And
they
that
as
though
they
wept
and
they
that
as
though
they
rejoiced
and
they
that
as
tho
ugh
they
possessed
1Cor7:31
And
they
that
use
this
as
not
abusing
for
the
fashion
of
this
world
passeth
1Cor7:32
But
I
would
have
you
without
He
that
is
unmarried
careth
for
the
things
that
belong
to
the
how
he
may
p
lease
the
1Cor7:33
But
he
that
is
married
careth
for
the
things
that
are
of
the
how
he
may
please
his
1Cor7:34
There
is
difference
also
between
a
wife
and
a
The
unmarried
woman
careth
for
the
things
of
the
that
she
may
be
holy
both
in
body
and
in
but
she
that
is
married
careth
for
the
things
of
the
how
she
may
please
her
1Cor7:35
And
this
I
speak
for
your
own
not
that
I
may
cast
a
snare
upon
but
for
that
which
is
and
that
ye
may
attend
upon
the
Lord
without
1Cor7:36
But
if
any
man
think
that
he
behaveth
himself
uncomely
toward
his
if
she
pass
the
flower
of
her
and
need
so
r
equire,
let
him
do
what
he
he
sinneth
let
them
1Cor7:37
Nevertheless
he
that
standeth
stedfast
in
his
having
no
but
hath
power
over
his
own
and
hath
so
de
creed
in
his
heart
that
he
will
keep
his
doeth
1Cor7:38
So
then
he
that
giveth
her
in
marriage
doeth
but
he
that
giveth
her
not
in
marriage
doeth
1Cor7:39
The
wife
is
bound
by
the
law
as
long
as
her
husband
but
if
her
husband
be
she
is
at
liberty
to
be
married
to
whom
she
only
in
the
1Cor7:40
But
she
is
happier
if
she
so
after
my
and
I
think
also
that
I
have
the
Spirit
of
1Cor8:1
Now
as
touching
things
offered
unto
we
know
that
we
all
have
Knowledge
puffeth
but
charity
edifieth.
1Cor8:2
And
if
any
man
think
that
he
knoweth
any
he
knoweth
nothing
yet
as
he
ought
to
1Cor8:3
But
if
any
man
love
the
same
is
known
of
1Cor8:4
As
concerning
therefore
the
eating
of
those
things
that
are
offered
in
sacrifice
unto
we
know
that
an
idol
is
nothin
g
in
the
and
that
there
is
none
other
God
but
1Cor8:5
For
though
there
be
that
are
called
whether
in
heaven
or
in
(as
there
be
gods
and
lords
many,)
1Cor8:6
But
to
us
there
is
but
one
the
of
whom
are
all
and
we
in
and
one
Lord
Jesus
by
whom
are
a
ll
and
we
by
1Cor8:7
Howbeit
there
is
not
in
every
man
that
for
some
with
conscience
of
the
idol
unto
this
hour
eat
it
as
a
thing
off
ered
unto
an

their
conscience
being
weak
is
1Cor8:8
But
meat
commendeth
us
not
to

if
we
are
we
the
if
we
eat
are
we
the
1Cor8:9
But
take
heed
lest
by
any
means
this
liberty
of
yours
become
a
stumblingblock
to
them
that
are
1Cor8:10
For
if
any
man
see
thee
which
hast
knowledge
sit
at
meat
in
the
idol's
shall
not
the
conscience
of
him
which
is
we
ak
be
emboldened
to
eat
those
things
which
are
offered
to
1Cor8:11
And
through
thy
knowledge

But
when

Mine
answer
to

Have

Have

of

1Cor9:6
Or
I

have
not

to

1Cor9:7
Who

that

If
we
have
sown

you

it
a
great
thing
if
we
shall
reap

If
others
be
partakers
of
this
power

not

Nevertheless
we
have
not
used
this
but
suffer
all
lest
we
should
hinder
the
gospel
of
1Cor9:13
Do
ye
not
know
that
they
which
minister
about
holy
things
live
of
the
things
of
the
and
they
which
wait
at

are
partakers
with

Even
so
hath
the
Lord
ordained
that
they
which
preach
the
gospel
should
live
of
the

But
I
have
used
none
of
these
neither
have
I
written
these
that
it
should
be
so
done
unto
for
it
were
better
for
me
to
than
that
any
man
should
make
my
glorying
1Cor9:16
For
though
I
preach

I
have
nothing
to
glory
for
necessity
is
laid
upon
woe
is
unto
if
I
preac

not

For
if
I
do
this
thing
I
have
a
but
if
against
my
a
dispensation
of
the
gospel
is
committed
unto
1Cor9:18
What
is
my
reward
Verily
when
I
preach
the
I
may
make
the
gospel
of
Christ
without
that
I
abus
e
not
my
power
in
the
1Cor9:19
For
though
I
be
free
from
all
yet
have
I
made
myself
servant
unto
that
I
might
gain
the
1Cor9:20
And
unto
the
Jews
I
became
as
a
that
I
might
gain

them
that
are
under

I

To

that
are

not
without
law
to

under

law
to
Christ,)
that
I
might

To
the

became
I
as
that
I
might
gain
the
I
am
made
all
things
to
all
that
I
might
by
all
means
save
1Cor9:23
And
this
I
do
for
the
gospel's
that
I
might
be
partaker
thereof
with
1Cor9:24
Know
ye
not
that

I
therefore
so
not
as
so
fight
not
as
one
that
beateth
the
1Cor9:27
But
I
keep
under
my
and
bring
it
into
lest
that
by
any
when
I
have
preached
to
I
myself
s
hould
be
a
1Cor10:1
I
would
not
that
ye
should
be
how
that
all
our
fathers
were
under
the
and
all
passed
through
the
1Cor10:2
And
were
all
baptized
unto
Moses
in
the
cloud
and
in
the
1Cor10:3
And
did
all
eat
the
same
spiritual
1Cor10:4
And
did
all
drink
the
same
spiritual
for
they
drank
of
that
spiritual
Rock
that
followed
and
that
Rock
was
Ch
rist.
1Cor10:5
But
with
many
of
them
God
was
not
well
for
they
were
overthrown
in
the
1Cor10:6
Now
these
things
were
our
to
the
intent
we
should
not
lust
after
evil
as
they
also
lusted.
1Cor10:7
Neither
be
ye
idolaters,
as
were
some
of
as
it
is
The
people
sat
down
to
eat
and
and
rose
up
to
play

1Cor10:8
Neither
let
us
commit
as
some
of
them
and
fell
in
one
day
three
and
twenty
1Cor10:9
Neither
let
us
tempt
as
some
of
them
also
and
were
destroyed
of
1Cor10:10
Neither
murmur
as
some
of
them
also
and
were
destroyed
of
the
1Cor10:11
Now
all
these
things
happened
unto
them
for
ensamples:
and
they
are
written
for
our
upon
whom
the
ends
of
the
world
are
1Cor10:12
Wherefore
let
him
that
thinketh
he
standeth
take
heed
lest
he
1Cor10:13
There
hath
no
temptation
taken
you
but
such
as
is
common
to
but
God
is
who
will
not
suffer
you
to
be
tempt
ed
above
that
ye
are
but
will
with
the
temptation
also
make
a
way
to
that
ye
may
be
able
to
bear
1Cor10:14
my
dearly
flee
from
1Cor10:15
I
speak
as
to
wise
judge
ye
what
I
1Cor10:16
The
cup
of
blessing
which
we
is
it
not
the
communion
of
the
blood
of
The
bread
which
we
is
it
not
t
he
communion
of
the
body
of
1Cor10:17
For
we
being
many
are
one
and
one
for
we
are
all
partakers
of
that
one
1Cor10:18
Behold
Israel
after
the
are
not
they
which
eat
of
the
sacrifices
partakers
of
the
1Cor10:19
What
say
I
that
the
idol
is
any
or
that
which
is
offered
in
sacrifice
to
idols
is
any
1Cor10:20
But
I
that
the
things
which
the
Gentiles
they
sacrifice
to
and
not
to
and
I
would
not
that
y

should
have
fellowship
with
1Cor10:21
Ye
cannot
drink
the
cup
of

the
cup
of
ye
cannot
be
partakers
of
the
Lord's
and
of
the
table
of
1Cor10:22
Do
we
provoke
the
Lord
to
are
we
stronger
than
1Cor10:23
All
things
are
lawful
for
but
all
things
are
not
all
things
are
lawful
for
but
all
things
edify
1Cor10:24
Let
no
man
seek
his
but
every
man
another's
1Cor10:25
Whatsoever
is
sold
in
the
that
asking
no
question
for
conscience
1Cor10:26
For
the
earth
is
the
and
the
fulness
1Cor10:27
If
any
of
them
that
believe
not
bid
you
to

and
ye
be
disposed
to
whatsoever
is
set
before
asking
n
o
question
for
conscience
1Cor10:28
But
if
any
man
say
unto
This
is
offered
in
sacrifice
unto

not
for
his
sake
that
shewed
and
for
consci
ence
for
the
earth
is
the
and
the
fulness
1Cor10:29
I
not
thine
but
of
the
for
why
is
my
liberty
judged
of
another
man's
1Cor10:30
For
if
I
by
grace
be
a
why
am
I
evil
spoken
of
for
that
for
which
I
give
1Cor10:31
Whether
therefore
ye
or
or
whatsoever
ye
do
all
to
the
glory
of
1Cor10:32
Give
none
neither
to
the
nor
to
the
nor
to
the
church
of
1Cor10:33
Even
as
I
please
all
men
in
all
not
seeking
mine
own
but
the
profit
of
that
they
may
be
1Cor11:1
Be
ye
followers
of
even
as
I
also
am
of
1Cor11:2
Now
I
praise
that
ye
remember
me
in
all
and
keep
the
as
I
delivered
them
to
1Cor11:3
But
I
would
have
you
that
the
head
of
every
man
is
and
the
head
of
the
woman
is
the
and
the
head
of
Chr
ist
is
1Cor11:4
Every
man
praying
or
having
his
head
dishonoureth
his
1Cor11:5
But
every
woman
that
prayeth
or
prophesieth
with
her
head
uncovered
dishonoureth
her
for
that
is
even
all
one
as
if
she
were
1Cor11:6
For
if
the
woman
be
not
let
her
also
be
but
if
it
be
a
shame
for
a
woman
to
be
shorn
or
let
her
be
1Cor11:7
For
a
man
indeed
ought
not
to
cover
his
forasmuch
as
he
is
the
image
and
glory
of
but
the
woman
is
the
glory
of
the
1Cor11:8
For
the
man
is
not
of
the
but
the
woman
of
the
1Cor11:9
Neither
was
the
man
created
for
the
but
the
woman
for
the
1Cor11:10
For
this
cause
ought
the
woman
to
have
power
on
her
head
because
of
the
1Cor11:11
Nevertheless
neither
is
the
man
without
the
neither
the
woman
without
the
in
the
1Cor11:12
For
as
the
woman
is
of
the
even
so
is
the
man
also
by
the
but
all
things
of
1Cor11:13
Judge
in
is
it
comely
that
a
woman
pray
unto
God
1Cor11:14
Doth
not
even
nature
itself
teach
if
a
man
have
long
it
is
a
shame
unto
1Cor11:15
But
if
a
woman
have
long
it
is
a
glory
to
for
her
hair
is
given
her
for
a
1Cor11:16
But
if
any
man
seem
to
be
we
have
no
such
neither
the
churches
of
1Cor11:17
Now
in
this
that
I
declare
unto
you
I
praise
you
that
ye
come
together
not
for
the
but
for
the
1Cor11:18
For
first
of
when
ye
come
together
in
the
I
hear
that
there
be
divisions
among
and
I
partly
believe
1Cor11:19
For
there
must
be
also
heresies
among
that
they
which
are
approved
may
be
made
manifest
among
1Cor11:20
When
ye
come
together
therefore
into
one
this
is
not
to
eat
the
Lord's
1Cor11:21
For
in
eating
every
one
taketh
before
other
his
own
and
one
is
and
another
is
1Cor11:22
have
ye
not
houses
to
eat
and
to
drink
or
despise
ye
the
church
of
and
shame
them
that
have
What
shal
l
I
say
to
shall
I
praise
you
in
I
praise
you
1Cor11:23
For
I
have
received
of
the
Lord
that
which
also
I
delivered
unto
That
the
Lord
Jesus
the
same
night
in
which
he
was

this
is

of

After
the
same
manner

This
cup
is
the
new
testament
in
my
this
d
o
as
oft
as
ye
drink
in
remembrance
of
1Cor11:26
For
as
often
as
ye
eat
this
and
drink
this
ye
do
shew
the
Lord's
death
till

Wherefore
whosoever
shall
eat
this
and
drink
this
cup
of
the
shall
be
guilty
of
the
body
and
blo

of

But
let
a
man
examine
and
so
let
him
eat
of
that
and
drink
of
that
1Cor11:29
For
he
that
eateth
and
drinketh
eateth
and
drinketh
damnation
to
not
discerning
the
Lord's
1Cor11:30
For
this
cause
many
are
weak
and
sickly
among
and
many
1Cor11:31
For
if
we
would
judge
we
should
not
be
1Cor11:32
But
when
we
are
we
are
chastened
of
the
that
we
should
not
be
condemned
with
the
1Cor11:33
my
when
ye
come
together
to
tarry

for

And
if
any
man
let
him
eat
at

ye
come
not
together

And
the
rest
will
I
set
in
order
when
I
1Cor12:1
Now
concerning
spiritual
I
would
not
have
you
1Cor12:2
Ye
know
that
ye
were
carried
away
unto
these
dumb
even
as
ye
were
1Cor12:3
Wherefore
I
give
you
to
that
no
man
speaking
by
the
Spirit
of
God
calleth
Jesus
and
that
no
man
can
say
that
Jesus
is
the
but
by
the
Holy
1Cor12:4
Now
there
are
diversities
of
but
the
same
1Cor12:5
And
there
are
differences
of
but
the
same
1Cor12:6
And
there
are
diversities
of
but
it
is
the
same
God
which
worketh
all
in
1Cor12:7
But
the
manifestation
of
the
Spirit
is
given
to
every
man
to
profit
1Cor12:8
For
to
one
is
given
by
the
Spirit
the
word
of
to
another
the
word
of
knowledge
by
the
same
1Cor12:9
To
another
faith
by
the
same
to
another
the
gifts
of
healing
by
the
same
1Cor12:10
To
another
the
working
of
to
another
to
another
discerning
of
to
another
divers
kinds
of
ton
gues;
to
another
the
interpretation
of
1Cor12:11
But
all
these
worketh
that
one
and
the
selfsame
dividing
to
every
man
severally
as
he
1Cor12:12
For
as
the
body
is
and
hath
many
and
all
the
members
of
that
one
being
are
one
so
also
is
1Cor12:13
For
by
one
Spirit
are
we
all
baptized
into
one
whether
we
be
Jews
or
whether
we
be
bond
or
and
have
been
all
made
to
drink
into
one
1Cor12:14
For
the
body
is
not
one
but
1Cor12:15
If
the
foot
shall
Because
I
am
not

therefore

And
if
the
ear
shall
Because
I
am
not

I
am
not
of

it
therefore
not
of

1Cor12:17
If
the
whole
body
were

were
the
If
the
whole
were
where
were
the
1Cor12:18
But
now
hath
God
set
the
members
every
one
of

in
the
as
it
hath
pleased
1Cor12:19
And
if
they
were
all
one
where
were
the
1Cor12:20
But
now
are
they
many
yet
but
one
1Cor12:21
And
the
eye
cannot
say
unto
the
I
have
no
need
of
nor
again
the
head
to
the
I
have
no
need
of
1Cor12:22
much
more
those
members
of
the
which
seem
to
be
more
are
1Cor12:23
And
those
members
of
the
which
we
think
to
be
less
upon
these
we
bestow
more
abundant
and
our
u
ncomely
parts
have
more
abundant
1Cor12:24
For
our
comely
parts
have
no
but
God
hath
tempered
the
body
having
given
more
abundant
honour
to
that
par
t
which
1Cor12:25
That
there
should
be
no
schism
in
the
but
that
the
members
should
have
the
same
care
one
for
1Cor12:26
And
whether
one
member
all
the
members
suffer
with
or
one
member
be
all
the
members
rejoice
with
it
.
1Cor12:27
Now
ye
are
the
body
of
and
members
in
1Cor12:28
And
God
hath
set
some
in

But
when

that

the
greatest
of

rather
that

For
he
that
speaketh
in
an
unknown
tongue
speaketh
not
unto
but
unto
for
no
man
understandeth
howbeit
in
th
e
spirit
he
speaketh
1Cor14:3
But
he
that
prophesieth
speaketh
unto
men
to

1Cor14:4
He
that
speaketh
in
an
unknown
tongue
edifieth
but
he
that
prophesieth
edifieth

I
would
that
ye
all
spake
with
but
rather
that
ye
for
greater
is
he
that
prophesieth
than
he
that
spe

with
except
he
that
the
church
may
receive
1Cor14:6
if
I
come
unto
you
speaking
with
what
shall
I
profit
except
I
shall
speak
to
you
either
by
re
velation,
or
by
or
by
or
by
1Cor14:7
And
even
things
without
life
giving
whether

except
they
give
a
distinction
in
the

shall
i

be
known

is
piped

For
if
the
trumpet
give
an
uncertain
who
shall
prepare
himself
to
the
1Cor14:9
So
likewise
except
ye
utter
by
the
tongue
words
easy
to
be
how
shall
it
be
known
what
is
for
ye
sh
all
speak
into
the
1Cor14:10
There
it
may
so
many
kinds
of
voices
in
the
and
none
of
them
is
without
1Cor14:11
Therefore
if
I
know
not
the
meaning
of
the

shall
be
unto
him
that
speaketh
a

he
that
speaketh
sha

be
a
barbarian
unto

Even
so
forasmuch
as
ye
are
zealous
of
spiritual
seek
that
ye
may
excel
to
the
edifying
of
the
1Cor14:13
Wherefore
let
him
that
speaketh
in
an
unknown
tongue
pray
that
he
may

For
if
I
pray
in
an
unknown
my
spirit
prayeth,
but
my
understanding
is
1Cor14:15
What
is
it
I
will
pray
with

I

pray
with

when
thou

of
the
unlearned
say
Amen
at
thy

of

not
what
thou

1Cor14:17
For
thou
verily

I
thank
my

speak
with

more
than

1Cor14:19
Yet
in
the
church
I
had
rather
speak
five
words
with
my

by
my
voice
I
might
teach
others
than

In
the
law
it
is
With
men
of
other
tongues

other
lips
will
I
speak
unto
this

yet
for
all

the
1Cor14:22
Wherefore

are

to
them
that

prophesying
serveth
not
for

that

for

If
therefore
the
whole
church

together
into

all

there

those

thus
are
the
secrets
of

all
things
be
done
unto
1Cor14:27
If
any
man
speak

an
unknown

it
be

at
the

that
by

But
if
there
be
no
let
him
keep
silence
in

let
him
speak

1Cor14:29
Let
the
prophets
speak
two
or
and
let

other

If
any
thing
be
revealed
to
another
that

For
ye
may
all
prophesy

all
may

all
may
be

And
the
spirits
of
the
prophets
are
subject
to

For
God
is
not
the
author
of
but
of
as
in
all
churches
of
the

Let
your
women
keep
silence

it
is
not
permitted
unto
them
to

they
are
commanded
to

as
also
saith
the
1Cor14:35
And
if
they
will
learn
any
let
them
ask
their
husbands
at
for
it
is
a
shame
for
women
to
speak
in
the
church

1Cor14:36
came
the
word
of
God
out
from
or
came
it
unto
you
1Cor14:37
If
any
man
think
himself
to
be
a
or
let
him
acknowledge
that
the
things
that
I
write
unto
you
are
the
commandments
of
the
1Cor14:38
But
if
any
man
be
let
him
be
1Cor14:39
covet
to
and
forbid
not
to
speak
with
1Cor14:40
Let
all
things
be
done
decently
and
in
1Cor15:1
I
declare
unto
you
the
gospel
which
I
preached
unto
which
also
ye
have
and
wherein
ye
s
tand;
1Cor15:2
By
which
also
ye
are
if
ye
keep
in
memory
what
I
preached
unto
unless
ye
have
believed
in
1Cor15:3
For
I
delivered
unto
you
first
of
all
that
which
I
also
how
that
Christ
died
for
our
sins
according
to
the
scrip
tures;
1Cor15:4
And
that
he
was
and
that
he
rose
again
the
third
day
according
to
the
1Cor15:5
And
that
he
was
seen
of
Cephas,
then
of
the
1Cor15:6
After
he
was
seen
of
above
five
hundred
brethren
at
of
whom
the
greater
part
remain
unto
this
but
som
e
are
fallen
1Cor15:7
After
he
was
seen
of
then
of
all
the
1Cor15:8
And
last
of
all
he
was
seen
of
me
as
of
one
born
out
of
due
1Cor15:9
For
I
am
the
least
of
the
that
am
not
meet
to
be
called
an
because
I
persecuted
the
church
of
1Cor15:10
But
by
the
grace
of
God
I
am
what
I
and
his
grace
which
was
bestowed
upon
me
was
not
in
but
I
laboured
more
abu
ndantly
than
they
yet
not
but
the
grace
of
God
which
was
with
1Cor15:11
Therefore
whether
it
were
I
or
so
we
and
so
ye
1Cor15:12
Now
if
Christ
be
preached
that
he
rose
from
the
how
say
some
among
you
that
there
is
no
resurrection
of
the
1Cor15:13
But
if
there
be
no
resurrection
of
the
then
is
Christ
not
1Cor15:14
And
if
Christ
be
not
then
is
our
preaching
and
your
faith
is
also
1Cor15:15
and
we
are
found
false
witnesses
of
because
we
have
testified
of
God
that
he
raised
up
whom
he
raised
n
ot
if
so
be
that
the
dead
rise
1Cor15:16
For
if
the
dead
rise
then
is
not
Christ
1Cor15:17
And
if
Christ
be
not
your
faith
is
ye
are
yet
in
your
1Cor15:18
Then
they
also
which
are
fallen
asleep
in
Christ
are
1Cor15:19
If
in
this
life
only
we
have
hope
in
we
are
of
all
men
most
1Cor15:20
But
now
is
Christ
risen
from
the
and
become
the
firstfruits
of
them
that
1Cor15:21
For
since
by
man
came
by
man
came
also
the
resurrection
of
the
1Cor15:22
For
as
in
Adam
all
even
so
in
Christ
shall
all
be
made
1Cor15:23
But
every
man
in
his
own
Christ
the
afterward
they
that
are
Christ's
at
his
1Cor15:24
Then
cometh
the
when
he
shall
have
delivered
up
the
kingdom
to
even
the
when
he
shall
have
put
down
all
rule
and
all
authority
and
1Cor15:25
For
he
must
till
he
hath
put
all
enemies
under
his
1Cor15:26
The
last
enemy
that
shall
be
destroyed
is
1Cor15:27
For
he
hath
put
all
things
under
his
But
when
he
saith
all
things
are
put
under
it
is
manifest
that
he
is
exce
pted,
which
did
put
all
things
under
1Cor15:28
And
when
all
things
shall
be
subdued
unto
then
shall
the
Son
also
himself
be
subject
unto
him
that
put
all
things
un
der
that
God
may
be
all
in
1Cor15:29
Else
what
shall
they
do
which
are
baptized
for
the
if
the
dead
rise
not
at
why
are
they
then
baptized
for
the
1Cor15:30
And
why
stand
we
in
jeopardy
every
1Cor15:31
I
protest
by
your
rejoicing
which
I
have
in
Christ
Jesus
our
I
die
1Cor15:32
If
after
the
manner
of
men
I
have
fought
with
beasts
at
what
advantageth
it
if
the
dead
rise
let
us
eat
and
for
to
morrow
we

Be
not
evil
communications
corrupt
good

Awake
to
and
sin
for
some

not
the
knowledge
of

speak
this

But
some
man

How
are
the
dead
raised
and
with
what
body
do
they
1Cor15:36
Thou
that
which
thou
sowest
is
not
except
it
1Cor15:37
And
that
which
thou
sowest,
thou
sowest
not
that
body
that
shall
but
bare
it
may
chance
of

of
some

1Cor15:38
But
God
giveth
it
a
body
as
it
hath
pleased
and
to
every
seed
his
own
1Cor15:39
All
flesh
is
not
the
same
but
there
is
one
kind
of
flesh
of
another
flesh
of
another
of
and
a
nother
of
1Cor15:40
There
are
also
celestial
and
bodies
but
the
glory
of
the
celestial
is
and
the
glory
of
the
terr
estrial
is
1Cor15:41
There
is
one
glory
of
the
and
another
glory
of
the
and
another
glory
of
the
for
one
star
differeth
from
another
star
in
1Cor15:42
So
also
is
the
resurrection
of

It
is
sown
in

is
raised
in
1Cor15:43
It
is
sown

raised
in

sown
in
it
is
raised
in
1Cor15:44
It
is
sown

it
is
raised

spiritual
There
is
a
natural
and
there
is
a
spiritual
1Cor15:45
And
so
it
is
The
first
man
Adam
was
made
a
living
the
last
Adam
was
made
a
quickening
1Cor15:46
Howbeit
that
was
not
first
which
is
but
that
which
is
and
afterward
that
which
is
1Cor15:47
The
first
man
is
of
the
the
second

the
Lord
from
1Cor15:48
As
is
the
such
are
they
also
that
are
and
as
is
the
such
are
they
also
that
are
1Cor15:49
And
as
we
have
borne
the
image
of
the

shall
also
bear
the
image
of

Now

For

So
when

Now
concerning

for
the
as
I
have
given
order
to
the
churches
of
even
so
do
1Cor16:2
Upon
the
first
day
of
the
week
let
every
one
of
you
lay
by
him
in
as
God
hath
prospered
that
there
be
no

when
I

And
when
I
whomsoever
ye
shall
approve
by
your

will
I
send
to
bring
your
liberality
unto
1Cor16:4
And
if
it
be
meet
that
I
go
they
shall
go
with
1Cor16:5
Now
I
will
come
unto
when
I
shall
pass
through

I
do
pass
through
1Cor16:6
And
it
may
be
that
I
will

that
ye
may
bring
me
on
my
journey

I

I

while

I
will
tarry
at
Ephesus
until

For
a
great
door
and
effectual
is
opened
unto
and
there
are
many
1Cor16:10
Now
if
Timotheus
see
that
he
may
be
with
you
without

he
worketh
the
work
of

as
I
also
1Cor16:11
Let
no
man
therefore
despise
but
conduct
him
forth
in
that
he
may
come
unto
for
I
look
for
him
with
the
b
rethren.
1Cor16:12
As
touching
our
brother
Apollos,
I
greatly
desired
him
to
come
unto
you
with
the
but
his
will
was
not
at
all

come
at
this

will

Let
all
your
things
be
done
with
1Cor16:15
I
beseech
(ye
know
the
house
of
Stephanas,
that
it
is
the
firstfruits
of
Achaia,
and
that
they
have
addict
ed
themselves
to
the
ministry
of
the
saints,)
1Cor16:16
That
ye
submit
yourselves
unto
and
to
every
one
that
helpeth
with
and
laboureth.
1Cor16:17
I
am
glad
of
the
coming
of
Stephanas
and
Fortunatus
and
Achaicus:
for
that
which
was
lacking
on
your
part
they
have
suppl
ied.
1Cor16:18
For
they
have
refreshed
my
spirit
and
therefore
acknowledge
ye
them
that

churches

which
is
at

2Cor1:2
Grace
be
to
you
and
peace
from
God
our
and
from
the
Lord
Jesus
2Cor1:3
Blessed
be
even
the
Father
of
our
Lord
Jesus
the
Father
of
and
the
God
of
all
2Cor1:4
Who
comforteth
us
in
all
our
that
we
may
be
able
to
comfort
them
which
are
in
any
by
the
comfort
wher
ewith
we
ourselves
are
comforted
of
2Cor1:5
For
as
the
sufferings
of
Christ
abound
in
so
our
consolation
also
aboundeth
by
2Cor1:6
And
whether
we
be
it
is
for
your
consolation
and
which
is
effectual
in
the
enduring
of
the
same
suffe
rings
which
we
also
or
whether
we
be
it
is
for
your
consolation
and
2Cor1:7
And
our
hope
of
you
is
that
as
ye
are
partakers
of
the
so
shall
ye
be
also
of
the
consolatio
n.
2Cor1:8
For
we
would
have
you
ignorant
of
our
trouble
which
came
to
us
in
that
we
were
pressed
out
of
above
insomuch
that
we
despaired
even
of
2Cor1:9
But
we
had
the
sentence
of
death
in
that
we
should
not
trust
in
but
in
God
which
raiseth
the
2Cor1:10
Who
delivered
us
from
so
great
a
and
doth
in
whom
we
trust
that
he
will
yet
deliver
2Cor1:11
Ye
also
helping
together
by
prayer
for
that
for
the
gift
bestowed
upon
us
by
the
means
of
many
persons
thanks
may
be
g
iven
by
many
on
our
2Cor1:12
For
our
rejoicing
is
the
testimony
of
our
that
in
simplicity
and
godly
not
with
fleshly
wisdo
m,
but
by
the
grace
of
we
have
had
our
conversation
in
the
and
more
abundantly
to
you-ward.
2Cor1:13
For
we
write
none
other
things
unto
than
what
ye
read
or
and
I
trust
ye
shall
acknowledge
even
to
the
en
d;
2Cor1:14
As
also
ye
have
acknowledged
us
in
that
we
are
your
even
as
ye
also
are
ours
in
the
day
of
the
Lord
Jesus
.
2Cor1:15
And
in
this
confidence
I
was
minded
to
come
unto
you
that
ye
might
have
a
second
2Cor1:16
And
to
pass
by
you
into
and
to
come
again
out
of
Macedonia
unto
and
of
you
to
be
brought
on
my
way
toward
2Cor1:17
When
I
therefore
was
thus
did
I
use
or
the
things
that
I
do
I
purpose
according
to
the
that
with
me
there
should
be
yea
and
nay
2Cor1:18
But
as
God
is
our
word
toward
you
was
not
yea
and
2Cor1:19
For
the
Son
of
Jesus
who
was
preached
among
you
by
even
by
me
and
Silvanus
and
Timotheus,
was
not
yea
and
but
in
him
was
2Cor1:20
For
all
the
promises
of
God
in
him
are
and
in
him
unto
the
glory
of
God
by
2Cor1:21
Now
he
which
stablisheth
us
with
you
in
and
hath
anointed
is
2Cor1:22
Who
hath
also
sealed
and
given
the
earnest
of
the
Spirit
in
our
2Cor1:23
Moreover
I
call
God
for
a
record
upon
my
that
to
spare
you
I
came
not
as
yet
unto
2Cor1:24
Not
for
that
we
have
dominion
over
your
but
are
helpers
of
your
for
by
faith
ye
2Cor2:1
But
I
determined
this
with
that
I
would
not
come
again
to
you
in
2Cor2:2
For
if
I
make
you
who
is
he
then
that
maketh
me
but
the
same
which
is
made
sorry
by
2Cor2:3
And
I
wrote
this
same
unto
when
I
I
should
have
sorrow
from
them
of
whom
I
ought
to
having
confid
ence
in
you
that
my
joy
is
the
joy
of
you
2Cor2:4
For
out
of
much
affliction
and
anguish
of
heart
I
wrote
unto
you
with
many
not
that
ye
should
be
but
that
y
e
might
know
the
love
which
I
have
more
abundantly
unto
2Cor2:5
But
if
any
have
caused
he
hath
not
grieved
but
in
that
I
may
not
overcharge
you
2Cor2:6
Sufficient
to
such
a
man
is
this
which
was
inflicted
of
2Cor2:7
So
that
contrariwise
ye
ought
rather
to
forgive
and
comfort
lest
perhaps
such
a
one
should
be
swallowed
up
with
o
vermuch
2Cor2:8
Wherefore
I
beseech
you
that
ye
would
confirm
your
love
toward
2Cor2:9
For
to
this
end
also
did
I
that
I
might
know
the
proof
of
whether
ye
be
obedient
in
all
2Cor2:10
To
whom
ye
forgive
any
I
forgive
for
if
I
forgave
any
to
whom
I
forgave
for
your
sakes
forgave
I
i
t
in
the
person
of
2Cor2:11
Lest
Satan
should
get
an
advantage
of
for
we
are
not
ignorant
of
his
2Cor2:12
when
I
came
to
Troas
to
preach
Christ's
and
a
door
was
opened
unto
me
of
the
2Cor2:13
I
had
no
rest
in
my
because
I
found
not
Titus
my
but
taking
my
leave
of
I
went
from
thence
into
Mac
edonia.
2Cor2:14
Now
thanks
be
unto
which
always
causeth
us
to
triumph
in
and
maketh
manifest
the
savour
of
his
knowledge
by
u
s
in
every
2Cor2:15
For
we
are
unto
God
a
sweet
savour
of
in
them
that
are
and
in
them
that
2Cor2:16
To
the
one
we
are
the
savour
of
death
unto
and
to
the
other
the
savour
of
life
unto
And
who
is
sufficient
for
these
2Cor2:17
For
we
are
not
as
which
corrupt
the
word
of
but
as
of
but
as
of
in
the
sight
of
God
speak
we
in
2Cor3:1
Do
we
begin
again
to
commend
or
need
as
some
epistles
of
commendation
to
or
letters
of
commenda
tion
from
2Cor3:2
Ye
are
our
epistle
written
in
our
known
and
read
of
all
2Cor3:3
Forasmuch
as
ye
are
manifestly
declared
to
be
the
epistle
of
Christ
ministered
by
written
not
with
but
with
the
Sp
irit
of
the
living
not
in
tables
of
but
in
fleshy
tables
of
the
2Cor3:4
And
such
trust
have
we
through
Christ
to
God-ward:
2Cor3:5
Not
that
we
are
sufficient
of
ourselves
to
think
any
thing
as
of
but
our
sufficiency
is
of
2Cor3:6
Who
also
hath
made
us
able
ministers
of
the
new
not
of
the
but
of
the
for
the
letter
killeth,
bu
t
the
spirit
giveth
2Cor3:7
But
if
the
ministration
of
written
and
engraven
in
was
so
that
the
children
of
Israel
could
not
st
edfastly
behold
the
face
of
Moses
for
the
glory
of
his
which
glory
was
to
be
done
2Cor3:8
How
shall
not
the
ministration
of
the
spirit
be
rather
2Cor3:9
For
if
the
ministration
of
condemnation
be
much
more
doth
the
ministration
of
righteousness
exceed
in
2Cor3:10
For
even
that
which
was
made
glorious
had
no
glory
in
this
by
reason
of
the
glory
that
excelleth.
2Cor3:11
For
if
that
which
is
done
away
was
much
more
that
which
remaineth
is
2Cor3:12
Seeing
then
that
we
have
such
we
use
great
plainness
of
2Cor3:13
And
not
as
which
put
a
vail
over
his
that
the
children
of
Israel
could
not
stedfastly
look
to
the
end
of
that
which
is
2Cor3:14
But
their
minds
were
for
until
this
day
remaineth
the
same
vail
untaken
away
in
the
reading
of
the
old
which
vail
is
done
away
in
2Cor3:15
But
even
unto
this
when
Moses
is
the
vail
is
upon
their
2Cor3:16
Nevertheless
when
it
shall
turn
to
the
the
vail
shall
be
taken
2Cor3:17
Now
the
Lord
is
that
and
where
the
Spirit
of
the
Lord
there
is
2Cor3:18
But
we
with
open
face
beholding
as
in
a
glass
the
glory
of
the
are
changed
into
the
same
image
from
glory
to
gl
ory,
even
as
by
the
Spirit
of
the
2Cor4:1
Therefore
seeing
we
have
this
as
we
have
received
we
faint
2Cor4:2
But
have
renounced
the
hidden
things
of
not
walking
in
nor
handling
the
word
of
God
bu
t
by
manifestation
of
the
truth
commending
ourselves
to
every
man's
conscience
in
the
sight
of
2Cor4:3
But
if
our
gospel
be
it
is
hid
to
them
that
are
2Cor4:4
In
whom
the
god
of
this
world
hath
blinded
the
minds
of
them
which
believe
lest
the
light
of
the
glorious
gospel
of
Ch
rist,
who
is
the
image
of
should
shine
unto
2Cor4:5
For
we
preach
not
but
Christ
Jesus
the
and
ourselves
your
servants
for
2Cor4:6
For
who
commanded
the
light
to
shine
out
of
hath
shined
in
our
to
give
the
light
of
the
knowledge
of
the
glory
of
God
in
the
face
of
Jesus
2Cor4:7
But
we
have
this
treasure
in
earthen
that
the
excellency
of
the
power
may
be
of
and
not
of
2Cor4:8
We
are
troubled
on
every
yet
not
we
are
but
not
in
2Cor4:9
but
not
cast
but
not
2Cor4:10
Always
bearing
about
in
the
body
the
dying
of
the
Lord
that
the
life
also
of
Jesus
might
be
made
manifest
in
our
bo
dy.
2Cor4:11
For
we
which
live
are
alway
delivered
unto
death
for
that
the
life
also
of
Jesus
might
be
made
manifest
in
ou
r
mortal
2Cor4:12
So
then
death
worketh
in
but
life
in
2Cor4:13
We
having
the
same
spirit
of
according
as
it
is
I
and
therefore
have
I
we
also
and
therefore
2Cor4:14
Knowing
that
he
which
raised
up
the
Lord
Jesus
shall
raise
up
us
also
by
and
shall
present
us
with
2Cor4:15
For
all
things
are
for
your
that
the
abundant
grace
might
through
the
thanksgiving
of
many
redound
to
the
glory
of
2Cor4:16
For
which
cause
we
faint
but
though
our
outward
man
yet
the
inward
man
is
renewed
day
by
2Cor4:17
For
our
light
which
is
but
for
a
worketh
for
us
a
far
more
exceeding
and
eternal
weight
of
2Cor4:18
While
we
look
not
at
the
things
which
are
but
at
the
things
which
are
not
for
the
things
which
are
seen
are
te
mporal;
but
the
things
which
are
not
seen
are
2Cor5:1
For
we
know
that
if
our
earthly
house
of
this
tabernacle
were
we
have
a
building
of
an
house
not
made
with
eternal
in
the
2Cor5:2
For
in
this
we
earnestly
desiring
to
be
clothed
upon
with
our
house
which
is
from
2Cor5:3
If
so
be
that
being
clothed
we
shall
not
be
found
2Cor5:4
For
we
that
are
in
this
tabernacle
do
being
not
for
that
we
would
be
but
clothed
that
mor
tality
might
be
swallowed
up
of
2Cor5:5
Now
he
that
hath
wrought
us
for
the
selfsame
thing
is
who
also
hath
given
unto
us
the
earnest
of
the
2Cor5:6
Therefore
we
are
always
knowing
whilst
we
are
at
home
in
the
we
are
absent
from
the
2Cor5:7
(For
we
walk
by
not
by
sight:)
2Cor5:8
We
are
I
and
willing
rather
to
be
absent
from
the
and
to
be
present
with
the
2Cor5:9
Wherefore
we
whether
present
or
we
may
be
accepted
of
2Cor5:10
For
we
must
all
appear
before
the
judgment
seat
of
that
every
one
may
receive
the
things
done
in
his
accordi
ng
to
that
he
hath
whether
it
be
good
or
2Cor5:11
Knowing
therefore
the
terror
of
the
we
persuade
but
we
are
made
manifest
unto
and
I
trust
also
are
made
ma
nifest
in
your
2Cor5:12
For
we
commend
not
ourselves
again
unto
but
give
you
occasion
to
glory
on
our
that
ye
may
have
somewhat
to
an
swer
them
which
glory
in
and
not
in
2Cor5:13
For
whether
we
be
beside
it
is
to
or
whether
we
be
it
is
for
your
2Cor5:14
For
the
love
of
Christ
constraineth
because
we
thus
that
if
one
died
for
then
were
all
2Cor5:15
And
that
he
died
for
that
they
which
live
should
not
henceforth
live
unto
but
unto
him
which
died
for
the
m,
and
rose
2Cor5:16
Wherefore
henceforth
know
we
no
man
after
the
though
we
have
known
Christ
after
the
yet
now
henceforth
know
we
him
no
2Cor5:17
Therefore
if
any
man
be
in
he
is
a
new
old
things
are
passed
all
things
are
become
2Cor5:18
And
all
things
are
of
who
hath
reconciled
us
to
himself
by
Jesus
and
hath
given
to
us
the
ministry
of
reconci
liation;
2Cor5:19
To
that
God
was
in
reconciling
the
world
unto
not
imputing
their
trespasses
unto
and
hath
comm
itted
unto
us
the
word
of
2Cor5:20
Now
then
we
are
ambassadors
for
as
though
God
did
beseech
you
by
we
pray
you
in
Christ's
be
ye
reconcil
ed
to
2Cor5:21
For
he
hath
made
him
to
be
sin
for
who
knew
no
that
we
might
be
made
the
righteousness
of
God
in
2Cor6:1
We
as
workers
together
with
beseech
you
also
that
ye
receive
not
the
grace
of
God
in
2Cor6:2
(For
he
I
have
heard
thee
in
a
time
and
in
the
day
of
salvation
have
I
succoured
now
is
the
accepted
now
is
the
day
of
salvation.)
2Cor6:3
Giving
no
offence
in
any
that
the
ministry
be
not
2Cor6:4
But
in
all
things
approving
ourselves
as
the
ministers
of

Now

a
recompence
in

speak
as

2Cor6:14
Be
ye
not

for
what
fellowship

what
communion
hath
light
with

And
what
concord

Christ
with

what

And

Having

Nevertheless

And
not
by
his
coming
but
by
the
consolation
wherewith
he
was
comforted
in
when
he
told
us
your
earnest
your
your
fervent
mind
toward

that
I
rejoiced

For
though
I
made
you
sorry
with

I

I

that
the

epistle
hath
made

Now
I
not
that
ye

that
ye
sorrowed

ye
were
made
sorry
after
a
godly
manner
,
that
ye
might
receive
damage
by

in

For
godly
sorrow
worketh
repentance
to

the
sorrow
of

For
behold
this

sorrowed

carefulness

in
what

In
all
things
ye
have
approved
yourselves
to

unto

it
not

cause
that
had

for
his
cause
that
suffered

but
that
our
care
for
you
in
the
sight
of
God
might
appear
unto
2Cor7:13
Therefore
we
were
comforted
in
your
and
exceedingly
the
more
joyed
we
for
the
joy
of
because
his
spir
it
was
refreshed
by
you
2Cor7:14
For
if
I
have
boasted
any
thing
to
him
of
I
am
not
but
as
we
spake
all
things
to
you
in
even
so
our
b

which
I
made
before
is
found

And
his
inward
affection
is
more
abundant
toward
whilst
he
remembereth
the
obedience
of
you
how
with
fear
and
tr
embling
ye
received
2Cor7:16
I
rejoice
therefore
that
I
have
confidence
in
you
in
all
2Cor8:1
we
do
you
to
wit
of
the
grace
of
God
bestowed
on
the
churches
of
2Cor8:2
How
that
in
a
great
trial
of
affliction
the
abundance
of
their
joy
and
their
deep
poverty
abounded
unto
the
riches
of
their
2Cor8:3
For
to
their
I
bear
and
beyond
their
power
they
were
willing
of
2Cor8:4
Praying
us
with
much
intreaty
that
we
would
receive
the
and
take
upon
us
the
fellowship
of
the
ministering
to
the
sai
nts.
2Cor8:5
And
this
they
not
as
we
but
first
gave
their
own
selves
to
the
and
unto
us
by
the
will
of
2Cor8:6
Insomuch
that
we
desired
that
as
he
had
so
he
would
also
finish
in
you
the
same
grace
2Cor8:7
as
ye
abound
in
every
in
and
and
and
in
all
and
in
your
love
to
u
s,
see
that
ye
abound
in
this
grace
2Cor8:8
I
speak
not
by
but
by
occasion
of
the
forwardness
of
and
to
prove
the
sincerity
of
your
2Cor8:9
For
ye
know
the
grace
of
our
Lord
Jesus
though
he
was
yet
for
your
sakes
he
became
that
ye
throug
h
his
poverty
might
be
2Cor8:10
And
herein
I
give
my
for
this
is
expedient
for
who
have
begun
not
only
to
but
also
to
be
forward
a
year
2Cor8:11
Now
therefore
perform
the
doing
of
that
as
there
was
a
readiness
to
so
there
may
be
a
performance
also
out
of
th
at
which
ye

For
if
there
be
first
a
willing
it
is
accepted
according
to
that
a
man
and
not
according
to
that
he
hath
2Cor8:13
For
I
mean
not
that
other
men
be
and
ye
2Cor8:14
But
by
an
that
now
at
this
time
your
abundance
may
be
a
supply
for
their
that
their
abundance
also
may
be
a
supply
for
your
that
there
may
be
2Cor8:15
As
it
is
He
that
had
gathered
much
had
nothing
and
he
that
had
gathered
little
had
no
2Cor8:16
But
thanks
be
to
which
put
the
same
earnest
care
into
the
heart
of
Titus
for
2Cor8:17
For
indeed
he
accepted
the
but
being
more
of
his
own
accord
he
went
unto
2Cor8:18
And
we
have
sent
with
him
the
whose
praise
is
in
the
gospel
throughout
all
the
2Cor8:19
And
not
that
but
who
was
also
chosen
of
the
churches
to
travel
with
us
with
this
which
is
administered
by
us
to
the
glory
of
the
same
and
declaration
of
your
ready
2Cor8:20
Avoiding
that
no
man
should
blame
us
in
this
abundance
which
is
administered
by
2Cor8:21
Providing
for
honest
not
only
in
the
sight
of
the
but
also
in
the
sight
of
2Cor8:22
And
we
have
sent
with
them
our
whom
we
have
oftentimes
proved
diligent
in
many
but
now
much
more
diligent
,
upon
the
great
confidence
which
I
have
in

Whether
any

enquire
of

partner
and
fellowhelper

brethren

glory

Wherefore
shew
ye
to

proof
of
your

of
our
boasting
on
your

For
as
touching
the
ministering
to
the

is
superfluous
for
me
to
write
to
2Cor9:2
For
I
know
the
forwardness
of
your

I
boast
of
you
to

meekness

gentleness
of
who
in
presence
am
base

being
absen

bold

But
I
beseech
that
I
may
not
be
bold
when
I
am
present
with
that
wherewith
I
think
to
be
bold
against
som

which
think
of
us
as
if
we
walked
according
to
the

For
though
we
walk

do
not
war
after

the
weapons
of
our
warfare

Casting

For
though
I
should
boast
somewhat
more
of
our
which
the
Lord
hath
given
us
for
and
not
for
your
d
estruction,
I
should
not
be

That
I
may
not
seem
as
if
I
would
terrify
you

For
his

are
weighty

but
his
bodily
presence

Let
such
an
one
think
such
as
we
are
in
word
by
letters
when
we
are

we
be
also
in
deed
when
we
are

For
we
dare
not
make
ourselves
of
the

compare
ourselves
with
some
that
commend
but
they
measuring
themselves
by
and
comparing
themselves
among
are
not
2Cor10:13
But
we
will
not
boast
of
things
without
our

according
to
the
measure
of
the
rule
which
God
hath
distributed
to
a
measure
to
reach
even
unto
2Cor10:14
For
we
stretch
not
ourselves
beyond
our
as
though
we
reached
not
unto
for
we
are
come
as
far
as
to
you
also
in
preaching
the
gospel
of

Not
boasting
of
things
without

shall
be
enlarged
by
you
according
to
our
rule

To
preach
the
gospel
in
the
regions
beyond
and
not
to
boast

Would
to

with
me
a

For
I
am
jealous
over

for
I

espoused
you

But
I
lest

I

I

But
though
I

not

we

been
throughly
made

Have
I
committed
an
offence

by

And
all
the
brethren
which
are
with

the
churches
of

Grace
be
to
you
and
peace
from
God

and
from
our
Lord
Jesus
Gal1:4
Who
gave
himself
for
our
that
he
might
deliver
us
from
this
present
evil
according
to
the
will
of
God
and
our
F
ather:
Gal1:5
To
whom
be
glory
for
ever
and
Gal1:6
I
marvel
that
ye
are
so
soon
removed
from
him
that
called
you
into
the
grace
of
Christ
unto
another
Gal1:7
Which
is
not
but
there
be
some
that
trouble
and
would
pervert
the
gospel
of
Gal1:8
But
though
or
an
angel
from
preach
any
other
gospel
unto
you
than
that
which
we
have
preached
unto
let
him
be
Gal1:9
As
we
said
so
say
I
now
If
any
man
preach
any
other
gospel
unto
you
than
that
ye
have
let
him
be
ac
Gal1:10
For
do
I
now
persuade
or
or
do
I
seek
to
please
for
if
I
yet
pleased
I
should
not
be
the
servant
of
Chr
ist.
Gal1:11
But
I
certify
that
the
gospel
which
was
preached
of
me
is
not
after
Gal1:12
For
I
neither
received
it
of
neither
was
I
taught
but
by
the
revelation
of
Jesus
Gal1:13
For
ye
have
heard
of
my
conversation
in
time
past
in
the
how
that
beyond
measure
I
persecuted
the
church
of
and
wasted
Gal1:14
And
profited
in
the
religion
above
many
my
equals
in
mine
own
being
more
exceedingly
zealous
of
the
tradition
s
of
my
Gal1:15
But
when
it
pleased
who
separated
me
from
my
mother's
and
called
me
by
his
Gal1:16
To
reveal
his
Son
in
that
I
might
preach
him
among
the
immediately
I
conferred
not
with
flesh
and
Gal1:17
Neither
went
I
up
to
Jerusalem
to
them
which
were
apostles
before
but
I
went
into
and
returned
again
unto
Damas
cus.
Gal1:18
Then
after
three
years
I
went
up
to
Jerusalem
to
see
and
abode
with
him
fifteen
Gal1:19
But
other
of
the
apostles
saw
I
save
James
the
Lord's
Gal1:20
Now
the
things
which
I
write
unto
before
I
lie
Gal1:21
Afterwards
I
came
into
the
regions
of
Syria
and
Gal1:22
And
was
unknown
by
face
unto
the
churches
of
Judaea
which
were
in
Gal1:23
But
they
had
heard
That
he
which
persecuted
us
in
times
past
now
preacheth
the
faith
which
once
he
Gal1:24
And
they
glorified
God
in
Gal2:1
Then
fourteen
years
after
I
went
up
again
to
Jerusalem
with
and
took
Titus
with
me
Gal2:2
And
I
went
up
by
and
communicated
unto
them
that
gospel
which
I
preach
among
the
but
privately
to
them
which
were
of
lest
by
any
means
I
should
or
had
in
Gal2:3
But
neither
who
was
with
being
a
was
compelled
to
be
Gal2:4
And
that
because
of
false
brethren
unawares
brought
who
came
in
privily
to
spy
out
our
liberty
which
we
have
in
Christ
J
esus,
that
they
might
bring
us
into
Gal2:5
To
whom
we
gave
place
by
not
for
an
that
the
truth
of
the
gospel
might
continue
with
Gal2:6
But
of
these
who
seemed
to
be
(whatsoever
they
it
maketh
no
matter
to
God
accepteth
no
man's
person:)
fo
r
they
who
seemed
to
be
somewhat
in
conference
added
nothing
to
Gal2:7
But
when
they
saw
that
the
gospel
of
the
uncircumcision
was
committed
unto
as
the
gospel
of
the
circumcisi
on
was
unto
Gal2:8
(For
he
that
wrought
effectually
in
Peter
to
the
apostleship
of
the
the
same
was
mighty
in
me
toward
the
Genti
les:)
Gal2:9
And
when
Cephas,
and
who
seemed
to
be
perceived
the
grace
that
was
given
unto
they
gave
to
me
and
Barnabas
the
right
hands
of
that
we
should
go
unto
the
and
they
unto
the
Gal2:10
Only
they
would
that
we
should
remember
the
the
same
which
I
also
was
forward
to
Gal2:11
But
when
Peter
was
come
to
I
withstood
him
to
the
because
he
was
to
be
Gal2:12
For
before
that
certain
came
from
he
did
eat
with
the
but
when
they
were
he
withdrew
and
separated
h
imself,
fearing
them
which
were
of
the
Gal2:13
And
the
other
Jews
dissembled
likewise
with
insomuch
that
Barnabas
also
was
carried
away
with
their
Gal2:14
But
when
I
saw
that
they
walked
not
uprightly
according
to
the
truth
of
the
I
said
unto
Peter
before
them
If
t
hou,
being
a
livest
after
the
manner
of
and
not
as
do
the
why
compellest
thou
the
Gentiles
to
live
as
do
the
J
ews?
Gal2:15
We
who
are
Jews
by
and
not
sinners
of
the
Gal2:16
Knowing
that
a
man
is
not
justified
by
the
works
of
the
but
by
the
faith
of
Jesus
even
we
have
believed
in
Jes
us
that
we
might
be
justified
by
the
faith
of
and
not
by
the
works
of
the
for
by
the
works
of
the
law
shall
no
flesh
be
Gal2:17
But
while
we
seek
to
be
justified
by
we
ourselves
also
are
found
is
therefore
Christ
the
minister
of
s
God
Gal2:18
For
if
I
build
again
the
things
which
I
I
make
myself
a
Gal2:19
For
I
through
the
law
am
dead
to
the
that
I
might
live

I
am
crucified

nevertheless
I
yet
not
but
Christ
liveth
in
and
the
life
which
I
now
live
in
the

I
live
by
the
faith
of
the
Son
of
who
loved
and
gave
himself
for

I
do
not
frustrate
the
grace
of

if

are
ye
now
made
perfect
by
the
Gal3:4
Have
ye
suffered
so
many
things
in
if
it
be
yet
in
Gal3:5
He
therefore
that
ministereth
to
you
the
and
worketh
miracles
among
doeth
he
it
by
the
works
of
the
or
by
the
hearing
of
Gal3:6
Even
as
Abraham
believed
and
it
was
accounted
to
him
for
Gal3:7
Know
ye
therefore
that
they
which
are
of
the
same
are
the
children
of
Gal3:8
And
the
foreseeing
that
God
would
justify
the
heathen
through
preached
before
the
gospel
unto
say
ing,
In
thee
shall
all
nations
be
Gal3:9
So
then
they
which
be
of
faith
are
blessed
with
faithful
Gal3:10
For
as
many
as
are
of
the
works
of
the
law
are
under
the
for
it
is
Cursed
is
every
one
that
continueth
not
in
all
things
which
are
written
in
the
book
of
the
law
to
do
Gal3:11
But
that
no
man
is
justified
by
the
law
in
the
sight
of
it
is
The
just
shall
live
by
Gal3:12
And
the
law
is
not
of
The
man
that
doeth
them
shall
live
in
Gal3:13
Christ
hath
redeemed
us
from
the
curse
of
the
being
made
a
curse
for
for
it
is
Cursed
is
every
one
that
h
angeth
on
a
Gal3:14
That
the
blessing
of
Abraham
might
come
on
the
Gentiles
through
Jesus
that
we
might
receive
the
promise
of
the
Spir
it
through
Gal3:15
I
speak
after
the
manner
of
Though
it
be
but
a
man's
yet
if
it
be
no
man
disannulleth,
or
addeth
Gal3:16
Now
to
Abraham
and
his
seed
were
the
promises
He
saith
And
to
as
of
but
as
of
And
to
thy
which
is
Gal3:17
And
this
I
that
the
that
was
confirmed
before
of
God
in
the
which
was
four
hundred
and
thirty
y
ears
cannot
that
it
should
make
the
promise
of
none
Gal3:18
For
if
the
inheritance
be
of
the
it
is
no
more
of
but
God
gave
it
to
Abraham
by
Gal3:19
Wherefore
then
serveth
the
It
was
added
because
of
till
the
seed
should
come
to
whom
the
promise
was
m
ade;
and
it
was
ordained
by
angels
in
the
hand
of
a
Gal3:20
Now
a
mediator
is
not
a
mediator
of
but
God
is
Gal3:21
Is
the
law
then
against
the
promises
of
God
for
if
there
had
been
a
law
given
which
could
have
given
ver
ily
righteousness
should
have
been
by
the
Gal3:22
But
the
scripture
hath
concluded
all
under
that
the
promise
by
faith
of
Jesus
Christ
might
be
given
to
them
that
belie
ve.
Gal3:23
But
before
faith
we
were
kept
under
the
shut
up
unto
the
faith
which
should
afterwards
be
Gal3:24
Wherefore
the
law
was
our
schoolmaster
to
bring
us
unto
that
we
might
be
justified
by
Gal3:25
But
after
that
faith
is
we
are
no
longer
under
a
Gal3:26
For
ye
are
all
the
children
of
God
by
faith
in
Christ
Gal3:27
For
as
many
of
you
as
have
been
baptized
into
Christ
have
put
on
Gal3:28
There
is
neither
Jew
nor
there
is
neither
bond
nor
there
is
neither
male
nor
for
ye
are
all
one
in
Chr
ist
Gal3:29
And
if
ye
be
Christ's,
then
are
ye
Abraham's
and
heirs
according
to
the
Gal4:1
Now
I
That
the
as
long
as
he
is
a
differeth
nothing
from
a
though
he
be
lord
of
Gal4:2
But
is
under
tutors
and
governors
until
the
time
appointed
of
the
Gal4:3
Even
so
when
we
were
were
in
bondage
under
the
elements
of
the
Gal4:4
But
when
the
fulness
of
the
time
was
God
sent
forth
his
made
of
a
made
under
the
Gal4:5
To
redeem
them
that
were
under
the
that
we
might
receive
the
adoption
of
Gal4:6
And
because
ye
are
God
hath
sent
forth
the
Spirit
of
his
Son
into
your
Gal4:7
Wherefore
thou
art
no
more
a
but
a
and
if
a
then
an
heir
of
God
through
Gal4:8
Howbeit
when
ye
knew
not
ye
did
service
unto
them
which
by
nature
are
no
Gal4:9
But
after
that
ye
have
known
or
rather
are
known
of
how
turn
ye
again
to
the
weak
and
beggarly
wher
eunto
ye
desire
again
to
be
in
Gal4:10
Ye
observe
and
and
and
Gal4:11
I
am
afraid
of
lest
I
have
bestowed
upon
you
labour
in
Gal4:12
I
beseech
be
as
I
for
I
am
as
ye
ye
have
not
injured
me
at
Gal4:13
Ye
know
how
through
infirmity
of
the
flesh
I
preached
the
gospel
unto
you
at
the
Gal4:14
And
my
temptation
which
was
in
my
flesh
ye
despised
nor
but
received
me
as
an
angel
of
even
as
Christ
J
esus.
Gal4:15
Where
is
then
the
blessedness
ye
spake
for
I
bear
you
if
it
had
been
ye
would
have
plucked
out
your
own
and
have
given
them
to
Gal4:16
Am
I
therefore
become
your
because
I
tell
you
the
Gal4:17
They
zealously
affect
but
not
they
would
exclude
that
ye
might
affect
Gal4:18
But
it
is
good
to
be
zealously
affected
always
in
a
good
and
not
only
when
I
am
present
with
Gal4:19
My
little
of
whom
I
travail
in
birth
again
until
Christ
be
formed
in
Gal4:20
I
desire
to
be
present
with
you
and
to
change
my
for
I
stand
in
doubt
of
Gal4:21
Tell
ye
that
desire
to
be
under
the
do
ye
not
hear
the
Gal4:22
For
it
is
that
Abraham
had
two
the
one
by
a
the
other
by
a
freewoman.
Gal4:23
But
he
who
was
of
the
bondwoman
was
born
after
the
but
he
of
the
freewoman
was
by
Gal4:24
Which
things
are
an
for
these
are
the
two
the
one
from
the
mount
which
gendereth
to
wh
ich
is
Gal4:25
For
this
Agar
is
mount
Sinai
in
and
answereth
to
Jerusalem
which
now
and
is
in
bondage
with
her
Gal4:26
But
Jerusalem
which
is
above
is
which
is
the
mother
of
us
Gal4:27
For
it
is
thou
barren
that
bearest
break
forth
and
thou
that
travailest
for
the
desolate
h
ath
many
more
children
than
she
which
hath
an
Gal4:28
Now
as
Isaac
are
the
children
of
Gal4:29
But
as
then
he
that
was
born
after
the
flesh
persecuted
him
that
was
born
after
the
even
so
it
is
Gal4:30
Nevertheless
what
saith
the
Cast
out
the
bondwoman
and
her
for
the
son
of
the
bondwoman
shall
not
be
heir
w
ith
the
son
of
the
freewoman.
Gal4:31
So
we
are
not
children
of
the
but
of
the
Gal5:1
Stand
fast
therefore
in
the
liberty
wherewith
Christ
hath
made
us
and
be
not
entangled
again
with
the
yoke
of
Gal5:2
I
Paul
say
unto
that
if
ye
be
Christ
shall
profit
you
Gal5:3
For
I
testify
again
to
every
man
that
is
that
he
is
a
debtor
to
do
the
whole
Gal5:4
Christ
is
become
of
no
effect
unto
whosoever
of
you
are
justified
by
the
ye
are
fallen
from
Gal5:5
For
we
through
the
Spirit
wait
for
the
hope
of
righteousness
by
Gal5:6
For
in
Jesus
Christ
neither
circumcision
availeth
any
nor
but
faith
which
worketh
by
Gal5:7
Ye
did
run
who
did
hinder
you
that
ye
should
not
obey
the
Gal5:8
This
persuasion
cometh
not
of
him
that
calleth
Gal5:9
A
little
leaven
leaveneth
the
whole
Gal5:10
I
have
confidence
in
you
through
the
that
ye
will
be
none
otherwise
but
he
that
troubleth
you
shall
bear
his
whosoever
he
Gal5:11
And
if
I
yet
preach
why
do
I
yet
suffer
then
is
the
offence
of
the
cross
Gal5:12
I
would
they
were
even
cut
off
which
trouble
Gal5:13
ye
have
been
called
unto
only
use
not
liberty
for
an
occasion
to
the
but
by
love
serve
one
a
nother.
Gal5:14
For
all
the
law
is
fulfilled
in
one
even
in
Thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbour
as
Gal5:15
But
if
ye
bite
and
devour
one
take
heed
that
ye
be
not
consumed
one
of
Gal5:16
This
I
say
Walk
in
the
and
ye
shall
not
fulfil
the
lust
of
the
Gal5:17
For
the
flesh
lusteth
against
the
and
the
Spirit
against
the
and
these
are
contrary
the
one
to
the
so
that
ye
cannot
do
the
things
that
ye
Gal5:18
But
if
ye
be
led
of
the
ye
are
not
under
the
Gal5:19
Now
the
works
of
the
flesh
are
which
are
Gal5:20
seditions,
heresies,
Gal5:21
Envyings,
and
such
of
the
which
I
tell
you
as
I
have
also
told
you
in
time
that
they
which
do
such
things
shall
not
inherit
the
kingdom
of
Gal5:22
But
the
fruit
of
the
Spirit
is
longsuffering,
Gal5:23
against
such
there
is
no
Gal5:24
And
they
that
are
Christ's
have
crucified
the
flesh
with
the
affections
and
Gal5:25
If
we
live
in
the
let
us
also
walk
in
the
Gal5:26
Let
us
not
be
desirous
of
vain
provoking
one
envying
one
Gal6:1
if
a
man
be
overtaken
in
a
ye
which
are
restore
such
an
one
in
the
spirit
of
consideri
ng
lest
thou
also
be
Gal6:2
Bear
ye
one
another's
and
so
fulfil
the
law
of
Gal6:3
For
if
a
man
think
himself
to
be
when
he
is
he
deceiveth
Gal6:4
But
let
every
man
prove
his
own
and
then
shall
he
have
rejoicing
in
himself
and
not
in
Gal6:5
For
every
man
shall
bear
his
own
Gal6:6
Let
him
that
is
taught
in
the
word
communicate
unto
him
that
teacheth
in
all
good
Gal6:7
Be
not
God
is
not
for
whatsoever
a
man
soweth,
that
shall
he
also
Gal6:8
For
he
that
soweth
to
his
flesh
shall
of
the
flesh
reap
but
he
that
soweth
to
the
Spirit
shall
of
the
Spirit
rea
p
life
Gal6:9
And
let
us
not
be
weary
in
well
for
in
due
season
we
shall
if
we
faint
Gal6:10
As
we
have
therefore
let
us
do
good
unto
all
especially
unto
them
who
are
of
the
household
of
Gal6:11
Ye
see
how
large
a
letter
I
have
written
unto
you
with
mine
own
Gal6:12
As
many
as
desire
to
make
a
fair
shew
in
the
they
constrain
you
to
be
only
lest
they
should
suffer
pers
ecution
for
the
cross
of
Gal6:13
For
neither
they
themselves
who
are
circumcised
keep
the
but
desire
to
have
you
that
they
may
glory
in
yo
ur
Gal6:14
But
God
forbid
that
I
should
save
in
the
cross
of
our
Lord
Jesus
by
whom
the
world
is
crucified
unto
and
I
unto
the
Gal6:15
For
in
Christ
Jesus
neither
circumcision
availeth
any
nor
but
a
new
Gal6:16
And
as
many
as
walk
according
to
this
peace
be
on
and
and
upon
the
Israel
of
Gal6:17
From
henceforth
let
no
man
trouble
for
I
bear
in
my
body
the
marks
of
the
Lord
Gal6:18
the
grace
of

According

To

abounded

Eph1:9
Having
made
known
unto
us
the
mystery
of
his
according
to
his
good
pleasure
which
he
hath
purposed
in
Eph1:10
That
in

dispensation

fulness

together
in

all
things
in
both
which
are

which
are
on

in
Eph1:11
In

also
we
have
obtained

predestinated
according
to
the
purpose
of
him
who
worketh
all
things
af
ter
the
counsel
of
his
own

That
we
should
be
to
the
praise
of
his
who
first
trusted
in
Eph1:13
In
whom
ye
also
after
that
ye
heard
the
word
of
the
gospel
of
your
in
whom
also
after
that
ye
be
lieved,
ye
were
sealed
with
that
holy
Spirit
of
Eph1:14
Which
is
the
earnest
of
our
inheritance
until
the
redemption
of

purchased

the
praise

Wherefore
I
after
I
heard
of
your
faith
in
the
Lord
and
love
unto
all
the
Eph1:16
Cease
not
to
give
thanks
for
making
mention
of
you
in
my
Eph1:17
That
the
God
of
our
Lord
Jesus
the
Father

unto
you
the
spirit
of
wisdom
and
revelation
in
the

The
eyes
of
your
understanding
being
that
ye
may
know
what
is
the
hope
of
his
and
what
the
riches
of
the
glory
of
his
inheritance
in
the
Eph1:19
And
what
is
the
exceeding
greatness
of
his
power
to
us-ward
who
according
to
the
working
of
his
mighty
Eph1:20
Which
he
wrought
in
when
he
raised
him
from

set
him
at
his
own
right
hand
in
the
heavenly
Eph1:21
Far
above
all

and
every
name
that
is
not
only
in
this
but
a

in
that
which
is

Eph1:22
And
hath
put
all
things
under
his

gave
him
to

over
all
things
to
the

fulness
of
him

And
you

he
who
were
dead
in
trespasses
and
Eph2:2
Wherein
in
time
past
ye
walked
according
to
the
course
of
this
according
to
the
prince
of
the
power
of
the
the
s
pirit
that
now
worketh
in
the
children
of
Eph2:3
Among
whom
also
we
all
had
our
conversation
in
times
past
in
the
lusts
of
our
fulfilling
the
desires
of
the
flesh
and
of
the

were
by
nature
the
children

as
Eph2:4
But
who
is
rich
in
for
his
great
love
wherewith
he
loved
Eph2:5
Even
when
we
were
dead
in

quickened
us
together
with
(by
grace
ye
are
saved;)
Eph2:6
And
hath
raised
us
up
and
made
us
sit
together
in
heavenly
places
in
Christ
Eph2:7
That
in
the
ages
to
come
he
might
shew
the
exceeding
riches
of
his
grace
in
his
kindness
toward
us
through
Christ
Eph2:8
For
by
grace
are
ye
saved
through
and
that
not
of
it
is
the
gift
of
Eph2:9
Not
of
lest
any
man
should

For
we
are

created
in
Christ
Jesus
unto
good
which
God
hath
before
ordained
that
we
should
walk
in
Eph2:11
Wherefore
that

who
are
called
Uncircumcision
by
that
which
is
called
the
Circumcision

That
at
that
time
ye
were

covenants
of
having
no
and
without
God
in
the
Eph2:13
But
now
in
Christ
Jesus
ye
who
sometimes
were
far
off
are
made
nigh
by
the
blood
of
Eph2:14
For
he
is
our
who
hath
made
both
and
hath
broken
down
the
middle
wall
of
partition
between
Eph2:15
Having
abolished
in
his
flesh
the
even
the
law
of
commandments
contained
in
for
to
make
in
himself
of
t
wain
one
new
so
making
Eph2:16
And
that
he
might
reconcile
both
unto
God
in
one
body
by
the
having
slain
the
enmity
Eph2:17
And
came
and
preached
peace
to
you
which
were
afar
and
to
them
that
were
Eph2:18
For
through
him
we
both
have
access
by
one
Spirit
unto
the
Eph2:19
Now
therefore
ye
are
no
more
strangers
and
but
fellowcitizens
with
the
and
of
the
household
of
Eph2:20
And
are
built
upon
the
foundation
of
the
apostles
and
Jesus
Christ
himself
being
the
chief
corner
Eph2:21
In
whom
all
the
building
fitly
framed
together
groweth
unto
an
holy
temple
in
the
Eph2:22
In
whom
ye
also
are
builded
together
for
an
habitation
of
God
through
the
Eph3:1
For
this
cause
I
the
prisoner
of
Jesus
Christ
for
you
Eph3:2
If
ye
have
heard
of
the
dispensation
of
the
grace
of
God
which
is
given
me
to
you-ward:
Eph3:3
How
that
by
revelation
he
made
known
unto
me
the
(as
I
wrote
afore
in
few
Eph3:4
when
ye
ye
may
understand
my
knowledge
in
the
mystery
of
Eph3:5
Which
in
other
ages
was
not
made
known
unto
the
sons
of
as
it
is
now
revealed
unto
his
holy
apostles
and
prophets
by
th
e
Eph3:6
That
the
Gentiles
should
be
fellowheirs,
and
of
the
same
and
partakers
of
his
promise
in
Christ
by
the
Eph3:7
Whereof
I
was
made
a
according
to
the
gift
of
the
grace
of
God
given
unto
me
by
the
effectual
working
of
his
power
.
Eph3:8
Unto
who
am
less
than
the
least
of
all
is
this
grace
that
I
should
preach
among
the
Gentiles
the
unsearch
able
riches
of
Eph3:9
And
to
make
all
men
see
what
is
the
fellowship
of
the
which
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
hath
been
hid
in
w
ho
created
all
things
by
Jesus
Eph3:10
To
the
intent
that
now
unto
the
principalities
and
powers
in
heavenly
places
might
be
known
by
the
church
the
manifold
wisd
om
of
Eph3:11
According
to
the
eternal
purpose
which
he
purposed
in
Christ
Jesus
our
Eph3:12
In
whom
we
have
boldness
and
access
with
confidence
by
the
faith
of
Eph3:13
Wherefore
I
desire
that
ye
faint
not
at
my
tribulations
for
which
is
your
Eph3:14
For
this
cause
I
bow
my
knees
unto
the
Father
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Eph3:15
Of
whom
the
whole
family
in
heaven
and
earth
is
Eph3:16
That
he
would
grant
according
to
the
riches
of
his
to
be
strengthened
with
might
by
his
Spirit
in
the
inner
man
;
Eph3:17
That
Christ
may
dwell
in
your
hearts
by
that
being
rooted
and
grounded
in
Eph3:18
May
be
able
to
comprehend
with
all
saints
what
is
the
and
and
and
Eph3:19
And
to
know
the
love
of
which
passeth
that
ye
might
be
filled
with
all
the
fulness
of
Eph3:20
Now
unto
him
that
is
able
to
do
exceeding
abundantly
above
all
that
we
ask
or
according
to
the
power
that
worketh
in
Eph3:21
Unto
him
be
glory
in
the
church
by
Christ
Jesus
throughout
all
world
without
Eph4:1
I
the
prisoner
of
the
beseech
you
that
ye
walk
worthy
of
the
vocation
wherewith
ye
are
Eph4:2
With
all
lowliness
and
with
longsuffering,
forbearing
one
another
in
Eph4:3
Endeavouring
to
keep
the
unity
of
the
Spirit
in
the
bond
of
Eph4:4
There
is
one
and
one
even
as
ye
are
called
in
one
hope
of
your
Eph4:5
One
one
one
Eph4:6
One
God
and
Father
of
who
is
above
and
through
and
in
you
Eph4:7
But
unto
every
one
of
us
is
given
grace
according
to
the
measure
of
the
gift
of
Eph4:8
Wherefore
he
When
he
ascended
up
on
he
led
captivity
and
gave
gifts
unto
Eph4:9
(Now
that
he
what
is
it
but
that
he
also
descended
first
into
the
lower
parts
of
the
Eph4:10
He
that
descended
is
the
same
also
that
ascended
up
far
above
all
that
he
might
fill
all
things.)
Eph4:11
And
he
gave
and
and
and
pastors
and
Eph4:12
For
the
perfecting
of
the
for
the
work
of
the
for
the
edifying
of
the
body
of
Eph4:13
Till
we
all
come
in
the
unity
of
the
and
of
the
knowledge
of
the
Son
of
unto
a
perfect
unto
the
measure
of
the
stature
of
the
fulness
of
Eph4:14
That
we
henceforth
be
no
more
tossed
to
and
and
carried
about
with
every
wind
of
by
the
sleight
of
and
cunning
whereby
they
lie
in
wait
to
Eph4:15
But
speaking
the
truth
in
may
grow
up
into
him
in
all
which
is
the
even
Eph4:16
From
whom
the
whole
body
fitly
joined
together
and
compacted
by
that
which
every
joint
supplieth,
according
to
the
effectua
l
working
in
the
measure
of
every
maketh
increase
of
the
body
unto
the
edifying
of
itself
in
Eph4:17
This
I
say
and
testify
in
the
that
ye
henceforth
walk
not
as
other
Gentiles
in
the
vanity
of
their
m
Eph4:18
Having
the
understanding
being
alienated
from
the
life
of
God
through
the
ignorance
that
is
in
because
of
t
he
blindness
of
their
Eph4:19
Who
being
past
feeling
have
given
themselves
over
unto
to
work
all
uncleanness
with
Eph4:20
But
ye
have
not
so
learned
Eph4:21
If
so
be
that
ye
have
heard
and
have
been
taught
by
as
the
truth
is
in
Eph4:22
That
ye
put
off
concerning
the
former
conversation
the
old
which
is
corrupt
according
to
the
deceitful
Eph4:23
And
be
renewed
in
the
spirit
of
your
Eph4:24
And
that
ye
put
on
the
new
which
after
God
is
created
in
righteousness
and
true
Eph4:25
Wherefore
putting
away
speak
every
man
truth
with
his
for
we
are
members
one
of
Eph4:26
Be
ye
and
sin
let
not
the
sun
go
down
upon
your
Eph4:27
Neither
give
place
to
the
Eph4:28
Let
him
that
stole
steal
no
but
rather
let
him
working
with
his
hands
the
thing
which
is
that
he
may
ha
ve
to
give
to
him
that
needeth.
Eph4:29
Let
no
corrupt
communication
proceed
out
of
your
but
that
which
is
good
to
the
use
of
that
it
may
minister
grace
unto
the
Eph4:30
And
grieve
not
the
holy
Spirit
of
whereby
ye
are
sealed
unto
the
day
of
Eph4:31
Let
all
and
and
and
and
evil
be
put
away
from
with
all
Eph4:32
And
be
ye
kind
one
to
forgiving
one
even
as
God
for
Christ's
sake
hath
forgiven
Eph5:1
Be
ye
therefore
followers
of
as
dear
Eph5:2
And
walk
in
as
Christ
also
hath
loved
and
hath
given
himself
for
us
an
offering
and
a
sacrifice
to
God
for
a
sweet
smelling
Eph5:3
But
and
all
or
let
it
not
be
once
named
among
as
becometh
Eph5:4
Neither
nor
foolish
nor
which
are
not
but
rather
giving
of
Eph5:5
For
this
ye
that
no
nor
unclean
nor
covetous
who
is
an
hath
any
inheritance
in
the
kingdom
of
Christ
and
of
Eph5:6
Let
no
man
deceive
you
with
vain
for
because
of
these
things
cometh
the
wrath
of
God
upon
the
children
of
disobedienc
e.
Eph5:7
Be
not
ye
therefore
partakers
with
Eph5:8
For
ye
were
sometimes
but
now
are
ye
light
in
the
walk
as
children
of
Eph5:9
(For
the
fruit
of
the
Spirit
is
in
all
goodness
and
righteousness
and
truth;)
Eph5:10
Proving
what
is
acceptable
unto
the
Eph5:11
And
have
no
fellowship
with
the
unfruitful
works
of
but
rather
reprove
Eph5:12
For
it
is
a
shame
even
to
speak
of
those
things
which
are
done
of
them
in
Eph5:13
But
all
things
that
are
reproved
are
made
manifest
by
the
for
whatsoever
doth
make
manifest
is
Eph5:14
Wherefore
he
Awake
thou
that
sleepest,
and
arise
from
the
and
Christ
shall
give
thee
Eph5:15
See
then
that
ye
walk
not
as
but
as
Eph5:16
Redeeming
the
because
the
days
are
Eph5:17
Wherefore
be
ye
not
but
understanding
what
the
will
of
the
Lord
Eph5:18
And
be
not
drunk
with
wherein
is
but
be
filled
with
the
Eph5:19
Speaking
to
yourselves
in
psalms
and
hymns
and
spiritual
singing
and
making
melody
in
your
heart
to
the
Eph5:20
Giving
thanks
always
for
all
things
unto
God
and
the
Father
in
the
name
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Eph5:21
Submitting
yourselves
one
to
another
in
the
fear
of
Eph5:22
submit
yourselves
unto
your
own
as
unto
the
Eph5:23
For
the
husband
is
the
head
of
the
even
as
Christ
is
the
head
of
the
and
he
is
the
saviour
of
the
Eph5:24
Therefore
as
the
church
is
subject
unto
so
let
the
wives
be
to
their
own
husbands
in
every
Eph5:25
love
your
even
as
Christ
also
loved
the
and
gave
himself
for
Eph5:26
That
he
might
sanctify
and
cleanse
it
with
the
washing
of
water
by
the
Eph5:27
That
he
might
present
it
to
himself
a
glorious
not
having
or
or
any
such
but
that
it
should
b
e
holy
and
without
Eph5:28
So
ought
men
to
love
their
wives
as
their
own
He
that
loveth
his
wife
loveth
Eph5:29
For
no
man
ever
yet
hated
his
own
but
nourisheth
and
cherisheth
even
as
the
Lord
the
Eph5:30
For
we
are
members
of
his
of
his
and
of
his
Eph5:31
For
this
cause
shall
a
man
leave
his
father
and
and
shall
be
joined
unto
his
and
they
two
shall
be
one
Eph5:32
This
is
a
great
but
I
speak
concerning
Christ
and
the
Eph5:33
Nevertheless
let
every
one
of
you
in
particular
so
love
his
wife
even
as
and
the
wife
see
that
she
reverence
her
h
usband.
Eph6:1
obey
your
parents
in
the
for
this

Eph6:2
Honour
thy

which
is
the
first
commandment
with
Eph6:3
That
it

be
well
with

thou
mayest

on

with

of
your

as
unto
Eph6:6
Not
with

as
the
servants
of
doing
the
will
of
God
from
the
Eph6:7
With
good
will
doing
as
to

and
not

Knowing
that

any
man
doeth,
the

shall
he
receive
of
the
whether

Put
on
the
whole
armour
of
that
ye
may
be
able
to
stand
against
the
wiles
of
the
Eph6:12
For
we
wrestle
not
against
flesh
and
but
against
against
against
the
rulers
of
the
darkness
of
this
against
spiritual
wickedness
in
high
Eph6:13
Wherefore
take
unto
you
the
whole
armour
of
that
ye
may
be
able
to
withstand
in
the
evil
and
having
done
to

Stand
having
your
loins
girt
about

on

breastplate
of
Eph6:15
And
your
feet
shod

the
preparation
of

Eph6:16
Above
taking
the
shield

For

I
thank
my
God
upon
every
remembrance
of

Always
in
every
prayer
of
mine
for
you
all
making
request
with
Phi1:5
For
your
fellowship
in
the
gospel
from
the
first
day
until
Phi1:6
Being
confident
of
this
very
that
he
which
hath
begun
a
good
work
in
you
will
perform
it
until
the
day
of
Jesus
Chris
t:
Phi1:7
Even
as
it
is
meet
for
me
to
think
this
of
you
because
I
have
you
in
my
inasmuch
as
both
in
my
and
in
the
defence
and
confirmation
of
the
ye
all
are
partakers
of
my
Phi1:8
For
God
is
my
how
greatly
I
long
after
you
all
in
the
bowels
of
Jesus
Phi1:9
And
this
I
that
your
love
may
abound
yet
more
and
more
in
knowledge
and
in
all
Phi1:10
That
ye
may
approve
things
that
are
that
ye
may
be
sincere
and
without
offence
till
the
day
of
Phi1:11
Being
filled
with
the
fruits
of
which
are
by
Jesus
unto
the
glory
and
praise
of
Phi1:12
But
I
would
ye
should
that
the
things
which
happened
unto
me
have
fallen
out
rather
unto
the
furthera
nce
of
the
Phi1:13
So
that
my
bonds
in
Christ
are
manifest
in
all
the
and
in
all
other
Phi1:14
And
many
of
the
brethren
in
the
waxing
confident
by
my
are
much
more
bold
to
speak
the
word
without
Phi1:15
Some
indeed
preach
Christ
even
of
envy
and
and
some
also
of
good
Phi1:16
The
one
preach
Christ
of
not
supposing
to
add
affliction
to
my
Phi1:17
But
the
other
of
knowing
that
I
am
set
for
the
defence
of
the
Phi1:18
What
every
whether
in
or
in
Christ
is
and
I
therein
do
and
will
Phi1:19
For
I
know
that
this
shall
turn
to
my
salvation
through
your
and
the
supply
of
the
Spirit
of
Jesus
Phi1:20
According
to
my
earnest
expectation
and
my
that
in
nothing
I
shall
be
but
that
with
all
as
so
now
also
Christ
shall
be
magnified
in
my
whether
it
be
by
or
by
Phi1:21
For
to
me
to
live
is
and
to
die
is
Phi1:22
But
if
I
live
in
the
this
is
the
fruit
of
my
yet
what
I
shall
choose
I
wot
Phi1:23
For
I
am
in
a
strait
betwixt
having
a
desire
to
and
to
be
with
which
is
far
Phi1:24
Nevertheless
to
abide
in
the
flesh
is

therefore
I

supposed
it

If

Set

For

When

Mortify
therefore
your

evil

which
is

For
which
sake
the
wrath
of
God
cometh
on

In

Lie

Put
on

Forbearing

We

in

Remembering
without

your
work

of
and
patience
of
hope
in
our

in
the

of
God
and
our
1Th1:4
brethren
your
election
of
1Th1:5
For
our
gospel
came
not
unto
you
in
word
but
also
in
and
in
the
Holy
and
in
much
as
ye
know
w
hat
manner
of
men
we
were
among
you
for
your

And
ye
became
followers
of

of

having
received
the

in
much
with
joy
of
the
Holy
1Th1:7
So
that
ye
were
ensamples
to
all
that
believe
in
Macedonia
and
Achaia.
1Th1:8
For
from
you
sounded
out
the
word
of
the
Lord
not
only
in
Macedonia
and
Achaia,
but
also
in
every
place
your
faith
to
God-wa
rd
is
spread
so
that
we
need
not
to
speak
any
1Th1:9
For
they
themselves
shew
of
us
what
manner
of
entering
in
we
had
unto
and
how
ye
turned
to
God
from
idols
to
serve
the
living
and
true
1Th1:10
And
to
wait
for
his
Son
from
whom
he
raised
from
the
even
which
delivered
us
from
the
wrath
to
1Th2:1
For
know
our
entrance
in
unto
that
it
was
not
in
1Th2:2
But
even
after
that
we
had
suffered
and
were
shamefully
as
ye
at
we
were
bold
in
our
God
to
speak
unto
you
the
gospel
of
God
with
much
1Th2:3
For
our
exhortation
was
not
of
nor
of
nor
in
1Th2:4
But
as
we
were
allowed
of
God
to
be
put
in
trust
with
the

so
we

For
neither
at
any
time

we

ye
nor
a

of

Nor
of
men
sought
we
neither
of
nor
yet
of
when
we
might
have
been
as
the
apostles
of
Christ
.
1Th2:7
But
we
were
gentle
among
even
as
a
nurse
cherisheth
her
1Th2:8
So
being
affectionately
desirous
of
we
were
willing
to
have
imparted
unto
not
the
gospel
of
God
but
also
our
own
because
ye
were
dear
unto
1Th2:9
For
ye
our
labour
and
for
labouring
night
and
because
we
would
not
be
chargeable
unto
any
of
we
preached
unto
you
the
gospel
of
1Th2:10
Ye
are
and
God
how
holily
and
justly
and
unblameably
we
behaved
ourselves
among
you
that
1Th2:11
As
ye
know
how
we
exhorted
and
comforted
and
charged
every
one

That
ye
would
walk
worthy
of
who
hath
called
you
unto
his
kingdom
and
1Th2:13
For
this
cause
also
thank
we
God
without
when
ye
received
the
word
of
God
which
ye
heard
of
ye
receiv
ed
it
not
as
the
word
of
but
as
it
is
in
the
word
of
which
effectually
worketh
also
in
you
that

For

followers
of
the
churches
of
God
which
in
Judaea
are
in

for
ye
also
have
suffered

things
of
your

even
as
they
have
of
the

Who
both
killed
the
Lord
and
their
own
and
have
persecuted
and
they
please
not
and
are
contrary
t
o
all
1Th2:16
Forbidding
us
to
speak
to
the
Gentiles
that
they
might
be
to
fill
up
their
sins
for
the
wrath

come
upon

But
being
taken
from

for
a
short
time
in

the
more
abundantly
to
see

our

with

Wherefore
we
would

For

of
Are
not

presence
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
at
his
coming
?
1Th2:20
For
ye
are
our
glory
and
1Th3:1
Wherefore
when
we
could
no
longer
we
thought
it
good
to
be
left
at
Athens
1Th3:2
And
sent
Timotheus,
our
and
minister
of
and
our
fellowlabourer
in
the
gospel
of
to
establish
and
to
comfort
you
concerning
your

That
no
man
should
be
moved
by
these
for
yourselves
know
that
we
are
appointed
1Th3:4
For
when
we
were
with
we
told
you
before
that
we
should
suffer
even
as
it
came
to
and
ye
kno
w.
1Th3:5
For
this
when
I
could
no
longer
I
sent
to
know
your
lest
by
some
means
the
tempter
have
tempted
and
our
labour
be
in
1Th3:6
But
now
when
Timotheus
came
from
you
unto
and
brought
us
good
tidings
of
your
faith
and
and
that
ye
have
good
r
emembrance
of
us
desiring
greatly
to
see
as
we
also
to
see
1Th3:7
we
were
comforted
over
you
in
all
our
affliction
and
distress
by
your
1Th3:8
For
now
we
if
ye
stand
fast
in
the
1Th3:9
For
what
thanks
can
we
render
to
God
again
for
for
all
the
joy
wherewith
we
joy
for
your
sakes
before
our
1Th3:10
Night
and
day
praying
exceedingly
that
we
might
see
your
and
might
perfect
that
which
is
lacking
in
your
1Th3:11
Now
God
himself
and
our
and
our
Lord
Jesus
direct
our
way
unto
1Th3:12
And
the
Lord
make
you
to
increase
and
abound
in
love
one
toward
and
toward
all
even
as
we
do
toward
1Th3:13
To
the
end
he
may
stablish
your
hearts
unblameable
in
holiness
before
even
our
at
the
coming
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
with
all
his
1Th4:1
Furthermore
then
we
beseech
and
exhort
you
by
the
Lord
that
as
ye
have
received
of
us
how
ye
ought
to
walk
and
to
please
so
ye
would
abound
more
and
1Th4:2
For
ye
know
what
commandments
we
gave
you
by
the
Lord
1Th4:3
For
this
is
the
will
of
even
your
that
ye
should
abstain
from
1Th4:4
That
every
one
of
you
should
know
how
to
possess
his
vessel
in
sanctification
and
1Th4:5
Not
in
the
lust
of
even
as
the
Gentiles
which
know
not
1Th4:6
That
no
man
go
beyond
and
defraud
his
brother
in
any
because
that
the
Lord
is
the
avenger
of
all
as
we
also
ha
ve
forewarned
you
and
1Th4:7
For
God
hath
not
called
us
unto
but
unto
1Th4:8
He
therefore
that
despiseth,
despiseth
not
but
who
hath
also
given
unto
us
his
holy
1Th4:9
But
as
touching
brotherly
love
ye
need
not
that
I
write
unto
for
ye
yourselves
are
taught
of
God
to
love
one
1Th4:10
And
indeed
ye
do
it
toward
all
the
brethren
which
are
in
all
but
we
beseech
that
ye
increase
more
and
1Th4:11
And
that
ye
study
to
be
and
to
do
your
own
and
to
work
with
your
own
as
we
commanded
1Th4:12
That
ye
may
walk
honestly
toward
them
that
are
and
that
ye
may
have
lack
of
1Th4:13
But
I
would
not
have
you
to
be
concerning
them
which
are
that
ye
sorrow
even
as
others
whi
ch
have
no
1Th4:14
For
if
we
believe
that
Jesus
died
and
rose
even
so
them
also
which
sleep
in
Jesus
will
God
bring
with
1Th4:15
For
this
we
say
unto
you
by
the
word
of
the
that
we
which
are
alive
and
remain
unto
the
coming
of
the
Lord
shall
not
prevent
them
which
are
1Th4:16
For
the
Lord
himself
shall
descend
from
heaven
with
a
with
the
voice
of
the
and
with
the
trump
of
an
d
the
dead
in
Christ
shall
rise
1Th4:17
Then
we
which
are
alive
and
remain
shall
be
caught
up
together
with
them
in
the
to
meet
the
Lord
in
the
and
so
shall
we
ever
be
with
the
1Th4:18
Wherefore
comfort
one
another
with
these
1Th5:1
But
of
the
times
and
the
ye
have
no
need
that
I
write
unto
1Th5:2
For
yourselves
know
perfectly
that
the
day
of
the
Lord
so
cometh
as
a
thief
in
the
1Th5:3
For
when
they
shall
Peace
and
then
sudden
destruction
cometh
upon
as
travail
upon
a
woman
with
and
they
shall
not

But
are
not
in
that
that
day
should
overtake
you
as
a

Ye
are
all
the
children
of
and
the
children
of
the
we
are
not
of
the
nor
of

Therefore
let
us
not
as
do
but
let
us
watch
and
be
1Th5:7
For
they
that
sleep
sleep
in
the
and
they
that
be
drunken
are
drunken
in
the
1Th5:8
But
let
who
are
of
the
be
putting
on
the
breastplate
of
faith
and
and
for
an
the
hope
of
salva

1Th5:9
For
God
hath
not
appointed
us
to
but
to
obtain
salvation
by
our
Lord
Jesus
1Th5:10
Who
died
for
whether
we
wake
or
we
should
live
together
with
1Th5:11
Wherefore
comfort
yourselves
and
edify
one
even
as
also

And
we
beseech
to
know
them
which
labour
among

And
to
esteem
them
very
highly

In

you
by

The
grace
of
our
Lord
Jesus

be
with
2Th1:1
and
and
Timotheus,
unto
the
church
of
the
Thessalonians
in

and

2Th1:2
Grace
unto
and
from
God
our
Father
and
the
Lord
Jesus
2Th1:3
We
are
bound
to
thank
God
always
for
as
it
is
because
that
your
faith
groweth
and
the
char
ity
of
every

of

toward

2Th1:4
So
that
we
ourselves

of
God
for
your
patience
and
faith
in
all
your
persecutions

2Th1:5
Which
is
a
manifest
token
of
the
righteous
judgment
of
that
ye
may
be
counted
worthy
of
the
kingdom
of
for
which
y
e
also
2Th1:6
Seeing
it
is
a
righteous
thing
with
God
to
recompense
tribulation
to
them
that
trouble
2Th1:7
And
to
you
who
are
troubled
rest
with
when
the
Lord
Jesus
shall
be
revealed
from

with
his
mighty
2Th1:8
In
flaming
fire
taking
vengeance
on
them
that
know
not
and
that
obey
not
the
gospel
of

Who
shall
be
punished
with
everlasting
destruction
from

from

of

When

shall
come
to
be
glorified
in

and
to
be
admired
in
all
them
that

our
testimony
among

Wherefore
also
we
pray
always
for
that
our
God
would
count
you
worthy
of
this
and
fulfil
all
the
good
pleasur
e
of
his

the

2Th1:12
That

ye
in

to

of

and

Lo
rd
Jesus
2Th2:1
Now
we
beseech
by
the
coming
of
our
Lord
Jesus
and
by
our
gathering
together
unto
2Th2:2
That
ye
be
not
soon
shaken
in
or
be
neither
by
nor
by
nor
by
letter
as
from
as
that
the
da

of
Christ
is
at
2Th2:3
Let
no
man
deceive
you
by
any
for
that
day
shall
not
except
there
come
a
falling
away
and
that
man
of
si
n
be
the
son
of
2Th2:4
Who
opposeth
and
exalteth
himself
above
all
that
is
called
or
that
is
so
that
he
as
God
sitteth
in
the
temp
le
of
shewing
himself
that
he
is
2Th2:5
Remember
ye
when
I
was
yet
with
I
told
you
these
2Th2:6
And
now
ye
know
what
withholdeth
that
he
might
be
revealed
in
his
2Th2:7
For
the
mystery
of
iniquity
doth
already
only
he
who
now
letteth
will
until
he
be
taken
out
of
the
2Th2:8
And
then
shall
that
Wicked
be
whom
the
Lord
shall
consume
with
the
spirit
of
his
and
shall
destroy
with
the
brightness
of
his
2Th2:9
Even
whose
coming
is
after
the
working
of
Satan
with
all
power
and
signs
and
lying
2Th2:10
And
with
all
deceivableness
of
unrighteousness
in
them
that
because
they
received
not
the
love
of
the
that
t
hey
might
be
2Th2:11
And
for
this
cause
God
shall
send
them
strong
that
they
should
believe
a
2Th2:12
That
they
all
might
be
damned
who
believed
not
the
but
had
pleasure
in
2Th2:13
But
we
are
bound
to
give
thanks
alway
to
God
for
brethren
beloved
of
the
because
God
hath
from
the
beginning
cho
sen
you
to
salvation
through
sanctification
of
the
Spirit
and
belief
of
the
2Th2:14
Whereunto
he
called
you
by
our
to
the
obtaining
of
the
glory
of
our
Lord
Jesus
2Th2:15
stand
and
hold
the
traditions
which
ye
have
been
whether
by
or
our
2Th2:16
Now
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
and
even
our
which
hath
loved
and
hath
given
us
everlasting
consolation
and
good
hope
through
2Th2:17
Comfort
your
and
stablish
you
in
every
good
word
and
2Th3:1
pray
for
that
the
word
of
the
Lord
may
have
free
and
be
even
as
it
is
with
2Th3:2
And
that
we
may
be
delivered
from
unreasonable
and
wicked
for
all
men
have
not
2Th3:3
But
the
Lord
is
who
shall
stablish
and
keep
you
from
2Th3:4
And
we
have
confidence
in
the
Lord
touching
that
ye
both
do
and
will
do
the
things
which
we
command
2Th3:5
And
the
Lord
direct
your
hearts
into
the
love
of
and
into
the
patient
waiting
for
2Th3:6
Now
we
command
in
the
name
of
our
Lord
Jesus
that
ye
withdraw
yourselves
from
every
brother
that
walk
eth
and
not
after
the
tradition
which
he
received
of
2Th3:7
For
yourselves
know
how
ye
ought
to
follow
for
we
behaved
not
ourselves
disorderly
among
2Th3:8
Neither
did
we
eat
any
man's
bread
for
but
wrought
with
labour
and
travail
night
and
that
we
might
not
be
charg
eable
to
any
of
2Th3:9
Not
because
we
have
not
but
to
make
ourselves
an
ensample
unto
you
to
follow
2Th3:10
For
even
when
we
were
with
this
we
commanded
that
if
any
would
not
neither
should
he
2Th3:11
For
we
hear
that
there
are
some
which
walk
among
you
working
not
at
but
are
busybodies.
2Th3:12
Now
them
that
are
such
we
command
and
exhort
by
our
Lord
Jesus
that
with
quietness
they
and
eat
their
own
bre
2Th3:13
But
be
not
weary
in
well
2Th3:14
And
if
any
man
obey
not
our
word
by
this
note
that
and
have
no
company
with
that
he
may
be
2Th3:15
Yet
count
him
not
as
an
but
admonish
him
as
a
2Th3:16
Now
the
Lord
of
peace
himself
give
you
peace
always
by
all
The
Lord

with
you

The
salutation
of

with
mine
own

The
grace
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
be
with
you
1Tim1:1
an
apostle
of
Jesus
Christ
by
the
commandment
of
God
our
and
Lord
Jesus
which
is
our
1Tim1:2
Unto
my
own
son
in
the
and
from
God
our
Father
and
Jesus
Christ
our
1Tim1:3
As
I
besought
thee
to
abide
still
at
when
I
went
into
that
thou
mightest
charge
some
that
they
teach
no
other
1Tim1:4
Neither
give
heed
to
fables
and
endless
which
minister
rather
than
godly
edifying
which
is
in
faith
:
so
1Tim1:5
Now
the
end
of
the
commandment
is
charity
out
of
a
pure
and
of
a
good
and
of
faith
1Tim1:6
From
which
some
having
swerved
have
turned
aside
unto
vain
1Tim1:7
Desiring
to
be
teachers
of
the
understanding
neither
what
they
nor
whereof
they
1Tim1:8
But
we
know
that
the
law
is
if
a
man
use
it
1Tim1:9
Knowing
that
the
law
is
not
made
for
a
righteous
but
for
the
lawless
and
for
the
ungodly
and
for
si
nners,
for
unholy
and
for
murderers
of
fathers
and
murderers
of
for
manslayers,
1Tim1:10
For
whoremongers,
for
them
that
defile
themselves
with
for
menstealers,
for
for
perjured
and
if
t
here
be
any
other
thing
that
is
contrary
to
sound
1Tim1:11
According
to
the
glorious
gospel
of
the
blessed
which
was
committed
to
my
1Tim1:12
And
I
thank
Christ
Jesus
our
who
hath
enabled
for
that
he
counted
me
putting
me
into
the
1Tim1:13
Who
was
before
a
and
a
and
but
I
obtained
because
I
did
it
ignorantly
in
unbelie
f.
1Tim1:14
And
the
grace
of
our
Lord
was
exceeding
abundant
with
faith
and
love
which
is
in
Christ
1Tim1:15
This
is
a
faithful
and
worthy
of
all
that
Christ
Jesus
came
into
the
world
to
save
of
whom
I
am
1Tim1:16
Howbeit
for
this
cause
I
obtained
that
in
me
first
Jesus
Christ
might
shew
forth
all
longsuffering,
for
a
pattern
t
o
them
which
should
hereafter
believe
on
him
to
life
1Tim1:17
Now
unto
the
King
the
only
wise
be
honour
and
glory
for
ever
and
1Tim1:18
This
charge
I
commit
unto
son
according
to
the
prophecies
which
went
before
on
that
thou
by
them
migh
test
war
a
good
1Tim1:19
Holding
and
a
good
which
some
having
put
away
concerning
faith
have
made
1Tim1:20
Of
whom
is
Hymenaeus
and
whom
I
have
delivered
unto
that
they
may
learn
not
to
1Tim2:1
I
exhort
first
of
supplications,
intercessions,
and
giving
of
be
made
for
all
1Tim2:2
For
and
for
all
that
are
in
that
we
may
lead
a
quiet
and
peaceable
life
in
all
godliness
and
1Tim2:3
For
this
is
good
and
acceptable
in
the
sight
of
God
our
1Tim2:4
Who
will
have
all
men
to
be
and
to
come
unto
the
knowledge
of
the
1Tim2:5
For
there
is
one
and
one
mediator
between
God
and
the
man
Christ
1Tim2:6
Who
gave
himself
a
ransom
for
to
be
testified
in
due
1Tim2:7
Whereunto
I
am
ordained
a
and
an
(I
speak
the
truth
in
and
lie
not;)
a
teacher
of
the
Gentiles
i
n
faith
and
1Tim2:8
I
will
therefore
that
men
pray
every
lifting
up
holy
without
wrath
and
1Tim2:9
In
like
manner
that
women
adorn
themselves
in
modest
with
shamefacedness
and
not
with
broided
hair
,
or
or
or
costly
1Tim2:10
But
(which
becometh
women
professing
with
good
1Tim2:11
Let
the
woman
learn
in
silence
with
all
1Tim2:12
But
I
suffer
not
a
woman
to
nor
to
usurp
authority
over
the
but
to
be
in
1Tim2:13
For
Adam
was
first
then
1Tim2:14
And
Adam
was
not
but
the
woman
being
deceived
was
in
the
1Tim2:15
Notwithstanding
she
shall
be
saved
in
if
they
continue
in
faith
and
charity
and
holiness
with
1Tim3:1
This
is
a
true
If
a
man
desire
the
office
of
a
he
desireth
a
good
1Tim3:2
A
bishop
then
must
be
the
husband
of
one
of
good
given
to
apt
to
1Tim3:3
Not
given
to
no
not
greedy
of
filthy
but
not
a
not
1Tim3:4
One
that
ruleth
well
his
own
having
his
children
in
subjection
with
all
1Tim3:5
(For
if
a
man
know
not
how
to
rule
his
own
how
shall
he
take
care
of
the
church
of
God?)
1Tim3:6
Not
a
lest
being
lifted
up
with
pride
he
fall
into
the
condemnation
of
the
1Tim3:7
Moreover
he
must
have
a
good
report
of
them
which
are
lest
he
fall
into
reproach
and
the
snare
of
the
1Tim3:8
Likewise
must
the
deacons
be
not
doubletongued,
not
given
to
much
not
greedy
of
filthy
1Tim3:9
Holding
the
mystery
of
the
faith
in
a
pure
1Tim3:10
And
let
these
also
first
be
then
let
them
use
the
office
of
a
being
found
1Tim3:11
Even
so
must
their
wives
be
not
slanderers,
faithful
in
all
1Tim3:12
Let
the
deacons
be
the
husbands
of
one
ruling
their
children
and
their
own
houses
1Tim3:13
For
they
that
have
used
the
office
of
a
deacon
well
purchase
to
themselves
a
good
and
great
boldness
in
the
faith
which
is
in
Christ
1Tim3:14
These
things
write
I
unto
hoping
to
come
unto
thee
1Tim3:15
But
if
I
tarry
that
thou
mayest
know
how
thou
oughtest
to
behave
thyself
in
the
house
of
which
is
the
church
of
the
living
the
pillar
and
ground
of
the
1Tim3:16
And
without
controversy
great
is
the
mystery
of
God
was
manifest
in
the
justified
in
the
seen
of
preached
unto
the
believed
on
in
the
received
up
into
1Tim4:1
Now
the
Spirit
speaketh
that
in
the
latter
times
some
shall
depart
from
the
giving
heed
to
seducing
spiri
ts,
and
doctrines
of
1Tim4:2
Speaking
lies
in
having
their
conscience
seared
with
a
hot
1Tim4:3
Forbidding
to
and
commanding
to
abstain
from
which
God
hath
created
to
be
received
with
thanksgiving
of
them
which
believe
and
know
the
1Tim4:4
For
every
creature
of
God
is
and
nothing
to
be
if
it
be
received
with
1Tim4:5
For
it
is
sanctified
by
the
word
of
God
and
1Tim4:6
If
thou
put
the
brethren
in
remembrance
of
these
thou
shalt
be
a
good
minister
of
Jesus
nourished
up
in
the
words
of
faith
and
of
good
whereunto
thou
hast
1Tim4:7
But
refuse
profane
and
old
and
exercise
thyself
rather
unto
1Tim4:8
For
bodily
exercise
profiteth
but
godliness
is
profitable
unto
all
having
promise
of
the
life
that
now
and
of
that
which
is
to
1Tim4:9
This
is
a
faithful
saying
and
worthy
of
all
1Tim4:10
For
therefore
we
both
labour
and
suffer
because
we
trust
in
the
living
who
is
the
Saviour
of
all
speci
ally
of
those
that
1Tim4:11
These
things
command
and
1Tim4:12
Let
no
man
despise
thy
but
be
thou
an
example
of
the
in
in
in
in
in
in
1Tim4:13
Till
I
give
attendance
to
to
to
1Tim4:14
Neglect
not
the
gift
that
is
in
which
was
given
thee
by
with
the
laying
on
of
the
hands
of
the
1Tim4:15
Meditate
upon
these
give
thyself
wholly
to
that
thy
profiting
may
appear
to
1Tim4:16
Take
heed
unto
and
unto
the
continue
in
for
in
doing
this
thou
shalt
both
save
and
them
that

Rebuke
not

The
elder
women
as
the
younger
as
with
all

Honour
widows
that
are
widows
1Tim5:4
But
if
any
widow
have
children
or
let
them
learn
first
to
shew
piety
at
and
to
requite
their

good
and
acceptable
before
1Tim5:5
Now
she
that
is
a
widow
and
trusteth
in
and
continueth
in
supplications
and
prayers
night
and
1Tim5:6
But
she
that
liveth
in
pleasure
is
dead
while
she
1Tim5:7
And
these
things
give
in
that
they
may
be
1Tim5:8
But
if
any
provide
not
for
his
and
specially
for
those
of
his
own
he
hath
denied

is
worse
than

1Tim5:9
Let
not
a
widow
be
taken
into
the
number
under
threescore
years
having
been
the
wife
of
one
1Tim5:10
Well
reported
of
for
good
if
she
have
brought
up
if
she
have
lodged
if
she
have
washed
the
sai
nts'
if
she
have
relieved
the
if
she
have
diligently
followed
every
good
1Tim5:11
But
the
younger
widows
for
when
they
have
begun
to
wax
wanton
against

will
1Tim5:12
Having
because
they
have
cast
off
their
first

And
withal
they
learn
to
be
wandering
about
from
house
to
and
not
only
but
tattlers
also
and
busybodies
,
speaking
things
which
they
ought
1Tim5:14
I
will
therefore
that
the
younger
women
bear
guide
the
give
none
occasion
to
the
adversary
to
spea

For
some
are
already
turned
aside
after

If
any
man
or
woman
that
believeth

let
them
relieve
and
let
not
the
church
be
that
it
may
reli
eve
them
that
are

1Tim5:17
Let
the
elders
that
rule
well
be
counted
worthy
of

especially
they
who
labour

the

not

Therefore
I
endure
all
things
for
the
elect's
that
they
may
also
obtain

salvation
which
is
in

In

Not

shewing

For
the

of
God
that

appeared
to
all
Titus2:12
Teaching
us
denying
ungodliness

These
things

Let
no

Put

ourselves
also
were

serving
divers
lusts

living
in
malice

But
after
that
the
kindness

of
God
our
Saviour
toward
man

Not
by
works

which
we
have

according
to
his
mercy

saved
by
the
washing
of

renewing
of
the
Holy
Titus3:6
Which
he
shed
on
us
abundantly
through

Christ
our
Titus3:7
That
being
justified
by
his
we
should
be
made
heirs

to

This
is
a
faithful
and
these

I
will
that
thou
affirm

Phmn1:4
I
thank
my
making
mention

thee
always
in
my
Phmn1:5
Hearing
of
thy
love
and
which
thou
hast
toward
the
Lord
and
toward
all
Phmn1:6
That
the
communication
of
thy
faith
may
become
effectual
by
the
acknowledging
of
every
good
thing
which
is
in
you
in
Christ
Phmn1:7
For
we
have
great
joy
and
consolation
in
thy
because
the
bowels
of
the
saints
are
refreshed
by
Phmn1:8
though
I
might
be
much
bold
in
Christ
to
enjoin
thee
that
which
is
Phmn1:9
Yet
for
love's
sake
I
rather
beseech
being
such
an
one
as
Paul
the
and
now
also
a
prisoner
of
Jesus
Phmn1:10
I
beseech
thee
for
my
son
Onesimus,
whom
I
have
begotten
in
my
Phmn1:11
Which
in
time
past
was
to
thee
but
now
profitable
to
thee
and
to
Phmn1:12
Whom
I
have
sent
thou
therefore
receive
that
mine
own
Phmn1:13
Whom
I
would
have
retained
with
that
in
thy
stead
he
might
have
ministered
unto
me
in
the
bonds
of
the
Phmn1:14
But
without
thy
mind
would
I
do
that
thy
benefit
should
not
be
as
it
were
of
but
Phmn1:15
For
perhaps
he
therefore
departed
for
a
that
thou
shouldest
receive
him
for
Phmn1:16
Not
now
as
a
but
above
a
a
brother
specially
to
but
how
much
more
unto
both
in
the
fl

and
in
the
Phmn1:17
If
thou
count
me
therefore
a
receive
him
as
Phmn1:18
If
he
hath
wronged
or
oweth
thee
put
that
on
mine
Phmn1:19
I
Paul
have
written
it
with
mine
own
I
will
repay
albeit
I
do
not
say
to
thee
how
thou
owest
unto
me
even
thine
own
self
Phmn1:20
let
me
have
joy
of
thee
in
the
refresh
my
bowels
in
the
Phmn1:21
Having
confidence
in
thy
obedience
I
wrote
unto
knowing
that
thou
wilt
also
do
more
than
I
Phmn1:22
But
withal
prepare
me
also
a
for
I
trust
that
through
your
prayers
I
shall
be
given
unto

Heb1:1
who
at
sundry
times
and
in
divers
manners
spake
in
time
past
unto
the
fathers
by
the
Heb1:2
Hath
in
these
last
days
spoken
unto
us
by
his
whom
he
hath
appointed
heir
of
all
by
whom
also
he
made
the
world

Heb1:3
Who
being
the
brightness
of
his
and
the
express
image
of
his
and
upholding
all
things
by
the
word
of
his
powe
r,
when
he
had
by
himself
purged
our
sat
down
on
the
right
hand
of
the
Majesty
on
Heb1:4
Being
made
so
much
better
than
the
as
he
hath
by
inheritance
obtained
a
more
excellent
name
than
Heb1:5
For
unto
which
of
the
angels
said
he
at
any
Thou
art
my
this
day
have
I
begotten
And
I
will
be
to
hi
m
a
and
he
shall
be
to
me
a
Heb1:6
And
when
he
bringeth
in
the
firstbegotten
into
the

And
let
all
the
angels
of
God
worship
Heb1:7
And
of
the
angels
he
Who
maketh
his
angels
and
his
ministers
a
flame
of
Heb1:8
But
unto
the
Son
he
Thy
O
is
for
ever
and
a
sceptre
of
righteousness
is
the
sceptre
of
thy
kingdom
.
Heb1:9
Thou
hast
loved
and
hated
therefore
even
thy
hath
anointed
thee
with
the
oil
of
gladness
above
thy
Heb1:10
in
the
beginning
hast
laid
the
foundation
of
the
and
the
heavens
are
the
works
of
thine
Heb1:11
They
shall
but
thou
remainest;
and
they
all
shall
wax
old
as
doth
a
Heb1:12
And
as
a
vesture
shalt
thou
fold
them
and
they
shall
be
but
thou
art
the

thy
years
shall
not

But
to
which
of
the
angels
said
he
at
any
Sit
on
my
right
until
I
make
thine
enemies
thy
Heb1:14
Are
they
not
all
ministering
sent
forth
to
minister
for
them
who
shall
be
heirs
of
Heb2:1
Therefore
we
ought
to
give
the
more
earnest
heed
to
the
things
which
we
have
lest
at
any
time
we
should
let
them
slip
.
Heb2:2
For
if
the
word
spoken
by
angels
was
and
every
transgression
and
disobedience
received
a
just
recompence
of
reward
;
Heb2:3
How
shall
we
if
we
neglect
so
great
which
at
the
first
began
to
be
spoken
by
the
and
was
confirmed
unto
us
by
them
that
heard
Heb2:4
God
also
bearing
them
both
with
signs
and
and
with
divers
and
gifts
of
the
Holy
according
to
his
own
Heb2:5
For
unto
the
angels
hath
he
not
put
in
subjection
the
world
to
whereof
we
Heb2:6
But
one
in
a
certain
place
What
is
that
thou
art
mindful
of
or
the
son
of
that
thou
visite
st
Heb2:7
Thou
madest
him
a
little
lower
than
the
thou
crownedst
him
with
glory
and
and
didst
set
him
over
the
works
o
f
thy
Heb2:8
Thou
hast
put
all
things
in
subjection
under
his
For
in
that
he
put
all
in
subjection
under
he
left
nothing
that
is
not
put
under
But
now
we
see
not
yet
all
things
put
under
Heb2:9
But
we
see
who
was
made
a
little
lower
than
the
angels
for
the
suffering
of
crowned
with
glory
and
tha
t
he
by
the
grace
of
God
should
taste
death
for
every

For
it
became
for
whom
are
all
and
by
whom
are
all
in
bringing
many
sons
unto
to
make
the
capta

of
their
salvation

For
both

that
sanctifieth
and
they
who
are
sanctified
are
all
of
for
which
cause
he
is
not
ashamed
to
call
them

Heb2:12
I
will
declare
thy
name
unto
my
in
the
midst
of
the
church

I
sing
praise
unto
Heb2:13
And
I
will
put
my
trust
in
And
Behold
I
and
the
children
which
God
hath
given
Heb2:14
Forasmuch
then
as
the
children
are
partakers
of
flesh
and
he
also
himself
likewise
took
part
of
the
that
throu

death
he
might
destroy

had
the
power
of

And
deliver
them
who
through
fear
of
death
were
all
their
lifetime
subject
to
Heb2:16
For
verily
he
took
not
on
him
the
nature
of

he
took
on
him
the
seed
of
Heb2:17
Wherefore
in
all
things
it
behoved
him
to
be
made
like
unto
his

the
Apostle
and
High
Priest
of
our
Christ
Heb3:2
Who
was
faithful
to
him
that
appointed
as
also
Moses
was
faithful
in
all
his
Heb3:3
For
this
man
was
counted
worthy
of
more
glory
than
inasmuch
as
he
who
hath
builded
the
house
hath
more
honour
than

For
every
house
is
builded
by
some
but

that
built
all
things

And
Moses
verily
was
faithful
in

were

(as

To

if
ye
will
hear

Harden
not
your
as
in

in
the
day
of
temptation
in
the
Heb3:9
When
your
fathers
tempted
proved
and
saw
my
works
forty
Heb3:10
Wherefore
I
was
grieved
with
that
and
They
do
alway
err
in
their
and
they
have
not
known
my
Heb3:11
So
I
sware
in
my
They
shall
not
enter
into
my
rest.)
Heb3:12
Take
lest
there
be
in
any
of
you
an
evil
heart
of
in
departing
from
the
living
Heb3:13
But
exhort
one
another
while
it
is
called
To
lest
any
of
you
be
hardened
through
the
deceitfulness
of
Heb3:14
For
we
are
made
partakers
of
if
we
hold
the
beginning
of
our
confidence
stedfast
unto
the
Heb3:15
While
it
is
To
day
if
ye
will
hear
his
harden
not
your
as
in
the
Heb3:16
For
when
they
had
did
howbeit
not
all
that
came
out
of
Egypt
by
Heb3:17
But
with
whom
was
he
grieved
forty
was
it
not
with
them
that
had
whose
carcases
fell
in
the
Heb3:18
And
to
whom
sware
he
that
they
should
not
enter
into
his
but
to
them
that
believed
Heb3:19
So
we
see
that
they
could
not
enter
in
because
of
Heb4:1
Let
us
therefore
a
promise
being
left
us
of
entering
into
his
any
of
you
should
seem
to
come
short
of
Heb4:2
For
unto
us
was
the
gospel
as
well
as
unto
but
the
word
preached
did
not
profit
not
being
mixed
with
f
aith
in
them
that
heard
Heb4:3
For
we
which
have
believed
do
enter
into
as
he
As
I
have
sworn
in
my
if
they
shall
enter
into
my
al
though
the
works
were
finished
from
the
foundation
of
the
Heb4:4
For
he
spake
in
a
certain
place
of
the
seventh
day
on
this
And
God
did
rest
the
seventh
day
from
all
his
Heb4:5
And
in
this
place
If
they
shall
enter
into
my
Heb4:6
Seeing
therefore
it
remaineth
that
some
must
enter
and
they
to
whom
it
was
first
preached
entered
not
in
because
of
Heb4:7
he
limiteth
a
certain
saying
in
To
after
so
long
a
as
it
is
To
day
if
ye
will
hear
his
v
oice,
harden
not
your
Heb4:8
For
if
Jesus
had
given
them
then
would
he
not
afterward
have
spoken
of
another
Heb4:9
There
remaineth
therefore
a
rest
to
the
people
of
Heb4:10
For
he
that
is
entered
into
his
he
also
hath
ceased
from
his
own
as
God
did
from
Heb4:11
Let
us
labour
therefore
to
enter
into
that
lest
any
man
fall
after
the
same
example
of
Heb4:12
For
the
word
of
God
is
and
and
sharper
than
any
twoedged
piercing
even
to
the
dividing
asunder
of
s
oul
and
and
of
the
joints
and
and
is
a
discerner
of
the
thoughts
and
intents
of
the
Heb4:13
Neither
is
there
any
creature
that
is
not
manifest
in
his
but
all
things
are
naked
and
opened
unto
the
eyes
of
him
w
ith
whom
we
have
to
Heb4:14
Seeing
then
that
we
have
a
great
high
that
is
passed
into
the
Jesus
the
Son
of
let
us
hold
fast
our
p
rofession.
Heb4:15
For
we
have
not
an
high
priest
which
cannot
be
touched
with
the
feeling
of
our
infirmities;
but
was
in
all
points
tempted
l
ike
as
we
yet
without
Heb4:16
Let
us
therefore
come
boldly
unto
the
throne
of
that
we
may
obtain
and
find
grace
to
help
in
time
of
Heb5:1
For
every
high
priest
taken
from
among
men
is
ordained
for
men
in
things
pertaining
to
that
he
may
offer
both
gifts
and
sacrifices
for
Heb5:2
Who
can
have
compassion
on
the
and
on
them
that
are
out
of
the
for
that
he
himself
also
is
compassed
with
inf
irmity.
Heb5:3
And
by
reason
hereof
he
as
for
the
so
also
for
to
offer
for
Heb5:4
And
no
man
taketh
this
honour
unto
but
he
that
is
called
of
as
was
Heb5:5
So
also
Christ
glorified
not
himself
to
be
made
an
high
but
he
that
said
unto
Thou
art
my
to
day
have
I
be
gotten
Heb5:6
As
he
saith
also
in
another
Thou
art
a
priest
for
ever
after
the
order
of
Melchisedec.
Heb5:7
Who
in
the
days
of
his
when
he
had
offered
up
prayers
and
supplications
with
strong
crying
and
tears
unto
him
that
wa
s
able
to
save
him
from
and
was
heard
in
that
he
Heb5:8
Though
he
were
a
yet
learned
he
obedience
by
the
things
which
he
Heb5:9
And
being
made
he
became
the
author
of
eternal
salvation
unto
all
them
that
obey
Heb5:10
Called
of
God
an
high
priest
after
the
order
of
Melchisedec.
Heb5:11
Of
whom
we
have
many
things
to
and
hard
to
be
seeing
ye
are
dull
of
Heb5:12
For
when
for
the
time
ye
ought
to
be
ye
have
need
that
one
teach
you
again
which
be
the
first
principles
of
the
o
racles
of

For
every

unskilful
in

But

Therefore
leaving
the
principles
of
the
doctrine

us
go
on
unto
not
laying
again
the
foundation
of
repentance
from
dead

of

Of
the
doctrine
of

of
laying
on
of

of

of

And
this
will

For
it
is
impossible
for
those
who
were
once
and
have
tasted
of
the
heavenly
and
were
made
partakers
of

And
have

of

If
they
shall
fall

again
unto

But
that
which
beareth
thorns
and
briers
is
and
is
nigh
unto
whose
end
is
to
be
Heb6:9
we
are
persuaded
better
things
of
and
things
that
accompany
though
we
thus
Heb6:10
For
God
is
not
unrighteous
to
forget
your
work
and
labour
of
which
ye
have
shewed
toward
his
in
that
ye
have
mi
nistered
to

do
Heb6:11
And
we
desire
that
every
one
of
you
do
shew
the
same
diligence
to
the
full
assurance
of
hope
unto
the
Heb6:12
That
ye
be
not
but
followers
of
them
who
through
faith
and
patience
inherit
the
Heb6:13
For
when
God
made
promise
to
because
he
could
swear
by
no
he
sware
by
Heb6:14
Surely
blessing
I
will
bless
and
multiplying
I
will
multiply
Heb6:15
And
after
he
had
patiently
he
obtained
the
Heb6:16
For
men
verily
swear
by
the
and
an
oath
for
confirmation
is
to
them
an
end
of
all
Heb6:17
Wherein
willing
more
abundantly
to
shew
unto
the
heirs
of
promise
the
immutability
of
his
confirmed
it
by
an
Heb6:18
That
by
two
immutable
in
which
it
was
impossible
for
God
to
we
might
have
a
strong
who
have
fled
for
refuge
to
lay
hold
upon
the
hope
set
before
Heb6:19
Which
hope
we
have
as
an
anchor
of
the
both
sure
and
and
which
entereth
into
that
within
the
Heb6:20
Whither
the
forerunner
is
for
us
even
made
an
high
priest
for
ever
after
the
order
of
Melchisedec.
Heb7:1
For
this
Melchisedec,
king
of
priest
of
the
most
high
who
met
Abraham
returning
from
the
slaughter
of
the
and
blessed
Heb7:2
To
whom
also
Abraham
gave
a
tenth
part
of
first
being
by
interpretation
King
of
and
after
that
also
King
of
which
King
of
Heb7:3
Without
without
without
having
neither
beginning
of
nor
end
of
but
made
like
unto
the
S
on
of
abideth
a
priest
Heb7:4
Now
consider
how
great
this
man
unto
whom
even
the
patriarch
Abraham
gave
the
tenth
of
the
Heb7:5
And
verily
they
that
are
of
the
sons
of
who
receive
the
office
of
the
have
a
commandment
to
take
tithes
of
the
people
according
to
the
that
of
their
though
they
come
out
of
the
loins
of
Heb7:6
But
he
whose
descent
is
not
counted
from
them
received
tithes
of
and
blessed
him
that
had
the
Heb7:7
And
without
all
contradiction
the
less
is
blessed
of
the
Heb7:8
And
here
men
that
die
receive
but
there
he
receiveth
of
whom
it
is
witnessed
that
he
Heb7:9
And
as
I
may
so
Levi
who
receiveth
payed
tithes
in
Heb7:10
For
he
was
yet
in
the
loins
of
his
when
Melchisedec
met
Heb7:11
If
therefore
perfection
were
by
the
Levitical
(for
under
it
the
people
received
the
law,)
what
further
need
was
there
that
another
priest
should
rise
after
the
order
of
Melchisedec,
and
not
be
called
after
the
order
of
Heb7:12
For
the
priesthood
being
there
is
made
of
necessity
a
change
also
of
the
Heb7:13
For
he
of
whom
these
things
are
spoken
pertaineth
to
another
of
which
no
man
gave
attendance
at
the
Heb7:14
For
it
is
evident
that
our
Lord
sprang
out
of
Juda;
of
which
tribe
Moses
spake
nothing
concerning
Heb7:15
And
it
is
yet
far
more
for
that
after
the
similitude
of
Melchisedec
there
ariseth
another
Heb7:16
Who
is
not
after
the
law
of
a
carnal
but
after
the
power
of
an
endless
Heb7:17
For
he
testifieth,
Thou
art
a
priest
for
ever
after
the
order
of
Melchisedec.
Heb7:18
For
there
is
verily
a
disannulling
of
the
commandment
going
before
for
the
weakness
and
unprofitableness
Heb7:19
For
the
law
made
nothing
but
the
bringing
in
of
a
better
hope
by
the
which
we
draw
nigh
unto
Heb7:20
And
inasmuch
as
not
without
an
oath
he
was
made
Heb7:21
(For
those
priests
were
made
without
an
but
this
with
an
oath
by
him
that
said
unto
The
Lord
sware
and
will
not
Thou
art
a
priest
for
ever
after
the
order
of
Melchisedec:)
Heb7:22
By
so
much
was
Jesus
made
a
surety
of
a
better
Heb7:23
And
they
truly
were
many
because
they
were
not
suffered
to
continue
by
reason
of
Heb7:24
But
this
because
he
continueth
hath
an
unchangeable
Heb7:25
Wherefore
he
is
able
also
to
save
them
to
the
uttermost
that
come
unto
God
by
seeing
he
ever
liveth
to
make
intercessi
on
for
Heb7:26
For
such
an
high
priest
became
who
is
undefiled,
separate
from
and
made
higher
than
the
heaven
s;
Heb7:27
Who
needeth
not
as
those
high
to
offer
up
first
for
his
own
and
then
for
the
for
this
he
did
when
he
offered
up
Heb7:28
For
the
law
maketh
men
high
priests
which
have
but
the
word
of
the
which
was
since
the
maketh
the
Son
,
who
is
consecrated
for
Heb8:1
Now
of
the
things
which
we
have
spoken
this
is
the
We
have
such
an
high
who
is
set
on
the
right
hand
of
the
thr
one
of
the
Majesty
in
the
Heb8:2
A
minister
of
the
and
of
the
true
which
the
Lord
and
not
Heb8:3
For
every
high
priest
is
ordained
to
offer
gifts
and
wherefore
it
is
of
necessity
that
this
man
have
somewhat
al
so
to
Heb8:4
For
if
he
were
on
he
should
not
be
a
seeing
that
there
are
priests
that
offer
gifts
according
to
the
Heb8:5
Who
serve
unto
the
example
and
shadow
of
heavenly
as
Moses
was
admonished
of
God
when
he
was
about
to
make
the
taber
nacle:
saith
that
thou
make
all
things
according
to
the
pattern
shewed
to
thee
in
the
Heb8:6
But
now
hath
he
obtained
a
more
excellent
by
how
much
also
he
is
the
mediator
of
a
better
which
was
esta
blished
upon
better
Heb8:7
For
if
that
first
covenant
had
been
then
should
no
place
have
been
sought
for
the
Heb8:8
For
finding
fault
with
he
the
days
saith
the
when
I
will
make
a
new
covenant
with
the
house
of
Israel
and
with
the
house
of
Heb8:9
Not
according
to
the
covenant
that
I
made
with
their
fathers
in
the
day
when
I
took
them
by
the
hand
to
lead
them
out
of
the
land
of
because
they
continued
not
in
my
and
I
regarded
them
saith
the
Heb8:10
For
this
is
the
covenant
that
I
will
make
with
the
house
of
Israel
after
those
saith
the
I
will
put
my
laws
int
o
their
and
write
them
in
their
and
I
will
be
to
them
a
and
they
shall
be
to
me
a
Heb8:11
And
they
shall
not
teach
every
man
his
and
every
man
his
Know
the
for
all
shall
know
from
the
least
to
the
Heb8:12
For
I
will
be
merciful
to
their
and
their
sins
and
their
iniquities
will
I
remember
no
Heb8:13
In
that
he
A
new
he
hath
made
the
first
Now
that
which
decayeth
and
waxeth
old
is
ready
to
vanish
awa

Heb9:1
Then
verily
the
first
covenant
had
also
ordinances
of
divine
and
a
worldly
Heb9:2
For
there
was
a
tabernacle
the
wherein
was
the
and
the
and
the
which
is
called
t
he
Heb9:3
And
after
the
second
the
tabernacle
which
is
called
the
Holiest
of
Heb9:4
Which
had
the
golden
and
the
ark
of
the
covenant
overlaid
round
about
with
wherein
was
the
golden
pot
that
had
and
Aaron's
rod
that
and
the
tables
of
the
Heb9:5
And
over
it
the
cherubims
of
glory
shadowing
the
mercyseat;
of
which
we
cannot
now
speak
Heb9:6
Now
when
these
things
were
thus
the
priests
went
always
into
the
first
accomplishing
the
service
of
Go
d.
Heb9:7
But
into
the
second
went
the
high
priest
alone
once
every
not
without
which
he
offered
for
and
for
the
errors
of
the
Heb9:8
The
Holy
Ghost
this
that
the
way
into
the
holiest
of
all
was
not
yet
made
while
as
the
first
tabernacl
e
was
yet
Heb9:9
Which
was
a
figure
for
the
time
then
in
which
were
offered
both
gifts
and
that
could
not
make
him
that
did
the
service
as
pertaining
to
the
Heb9:10
Which
stood
only
in
meats
and
and
divers
and
carnal
imposed
on
them
until
the
time
of
reforma
tion.
Heb9:11
But
Christ
being
come
an
high
priest
of
good
things
to
by
a
greater
and
more
perfect
not
made
with
that
is
to
not
of
this
Heb9:12
Neither
by
the
blood
of
goats
and
but
by
his
own
blood
he
entered
in
once
into
the
holy
having
obtained
eter
nal
redemption
for
Heb9:13
For
if
the
blood
of
bulls
and
of
and
the
ashes
of
an
heifer
sprinkling
the
sanctifieth
to
the
purifying
of
the
Heb9:14
How
much
more
shall
the
blood
of
who
through
the
eternal
Spirit
offered
himself
without
spot
to
purge
your
con
science
from
dead
works
to
serve
the
living
Heb9:15
And
for
this
cause
he
is
the
mediator
of
the
new
that
by
means
of
for
the
redemption
of
the
transgression
s
that
were
under
the
first
they
which
are
called
might
receive
the
promise
of
eternal
Heb9:16
For
where
a
testament
there
must
also
of
necessity
be
the
death
of
the
Heb9:17
For
a
testament
is
of
force
after
men
are
otherwise
it
is
of
no
strength
at
all
while
the
testator
Heb9:18
Whereupon
neither
the
first
testament
was
dedicated
without
Heb9:19
For
when
Moses
had
spoken
every
precept
to
all
the
people
according
to
the
he
took
the
blood
of
calves
and
of
w
ith
and
scarlet
and
and
sprinkled
both
the
and
all
the
Heb9:20
This
is
the
blood
of
the
testament
which
God
hath
enjoined
unto
Heb9:21
Moreover
he
sprinkled
with
blood
both
the
and
all
the
vessels
of
the
Heb9:22
And
almost
all
things
are
by
the
law
purged
with
and
without
shedding
of
blood
is
no
Heb9:23
It
was
therefore
necessary
that
the
patterns
of
things
in
the
heavens
should
be
purified
with
but
the
heavenly
thing
s
themselves
with
better
sacrifices
than
Heb9:24
For
Christ
is
not
entered
into
the
holy
places
made
with
which
are
the
figures
of
the
but
into
heaven
now
to
appear
in
the
presence
of
God
for
Heb9:25
Nor
yet
that
he
should
offer
himself
as
the
high
priest
entereth
into
the
holy
place
every
year
with
blood
of
others
;
Heb9:26
For
then
must
he
often
have
suffered
since
the
foundation
of
the
but
now
once
in
the
end
of
the
world
hath
he
appear
ed
to
put
away
sin
by
the
sacrifice
of
Heb9:27
And
as
it
is
appointed
unto
men
once
to
but
after
this
the
Heb9:28
So
Christ
was
once
offered
to
bear
the
sins
of
and
unto
them
that
look
for
him
shall
he
appear
the
second
time
withou
t
sin
unto
Heb10:1
For
the
law
having
a
shadow
of
good
things
to
and
not
the
very
image
of
the
can
never
with
those
sacrifices
w
hich
they
offered
year
by
year
continually
make
the
comers
thereunto
Heb10:2
For
then
would
they
not
have
ceased
to
be
because
that
the
worshippers
once
purged
should
have
had
no
more
conscie
nce
of
Heb10:3
But
in
those
sacrifices
there
is
a
remembrance
again
made
of
sins
every
Heb10:4
For
it
is
not
possible
that
the
blood
of
bulls
and
of
goats
should
take
away
Heb10:5
Wherefore
when
he
cometh
into
the
he
Sacrifice
and
offering
thou
wouldest
but
a
body
hast
thou
prepared
Heb10:6
In
burnt
offerings
and
sacrifices
for
sin
thou
hast
had
no
Heb10:7
Then
said
I
come
(in
the
volume
of
the
book
it
is
written
of
me,)
to
do
thy
O
Heb10:8
Above
when
he
Sacrifice
and
offering
and
burnt
offerings
and
offering
for
sin
thou
wouldest
neither
hadst
pleasu
re
which
are
offered
by
the
Heb10:9
Then
said
I
come
to
do
thy
O
He
taketh
away
the
that
he
may
establish
the
Heb10:10
By
the
which
will
we
are
sanctified
through
the
offering
of
the
body
of
Jesus
Christ
once
for
Heb10:11
And
every
priest
standeth
daily
ministering
and
offering
oftentimes
the
same
which
can
never
take
away
Heb10:12
But
this
after
he
had
offered
one
sacrifice
for
sins
for
sat
down
on
the
right
hand
of
Heb10:13
From
henceforth
expecting
till
his
enemies
be
made
his
Heb10:14
For
by
one
offering
he
hath
perfected
for
ever
them
that
are
Heb10:15
Whereof
the
Holy
Ghost
also
is
a
witness
to
for
after
that
he
had
said
Heb10:16
This
is
the
covenant
that
I
will
make
with
them
after
those
saith
the
I
will
put
my
laws
into
their
an
d
in
their
minds
will
I
write
Heb10:17
And
their
sins
and
iniquities
will
I
remember
no
Heb10:18
Now
where
remission
of
these
there
is
no
more
offering
for
Heb10:19
Having
boldness
to
enter
into
the
holiest
by
the
blood
of
Heb10:20
By
a
new
and
living
which
he
hath
consecrated
for
through
the
that
is
to
his
Heb10:21
And
having
an
high
priest
over
the
house
of
Heb10:22
Let
us
draw
near
with
a
true
heart
in
full
assurance
of
having
our
hearts
sprinkled
from
an
evil
and
ou
r
bodies
washed
with
pure
Heb10:23
Let
us
hold
fast
the
profession
of
our
faith
without
(for
he
is
faithful
that
promised;)
Heb10:24
And
let
us
consider
one
another
to
provoke
unto
love
and
to
good
Heb10:25
Not
forsaking
the
assembling
of
ourselves
as
the
manner
of
some
but
exhorting
one
and
so
much
the
m
as
ye
see
the
day
Heb10:26
For
if
we
sin
wilfully
after
that
we
have
received
the
knowledge
of
the
there
remaineth
no
more
sacrifice
for
Heb10:27
But
a
certain
fearful
looking
for
of
judgment
and
fiery
which
shall
devour
the
Heb10:28
He
that
despised
law
died
without
mercy
under
two
or
three
Heb10:29
Of
how
much
sorer
suppose
shall
he
be
thought
who
hath
trodden
under
foot
the
Son
of
and
hath
counted
the
blood
of
the
wherewith
he
was

But
call
to

whilst
ye
became

For
ye
had
compassion
of

took
joyfully
the

Cast

therefore

not

Abel

unto
God
a

without

it

For
so
is
the
will
of
that
with
well
doing
ye
may
put
to
silence
the
ignorance
of
foolish

As

For
this
is
if

For

when
ye

this
is
acceptable
with

For
even
hereunto
were
ye
because
Christ
also
suffered
for
leaving
us

that
ye
should
follow
his
st

1Pet2:22
Who
did
no
neither
was
guile
found
in
his
1Pet2:23
when
he
was
reviled
not
when

his
own
body
on

that
being
dead

live
unto

whose
stripes
ye
were

For
ye
were
as
sheep
going
but
are
now
returned

the
Shepherd
and
Bishop
of

be
in

your
own

any

they
also
may

the
conversation
of

1Pet3:2
While
they
behold
your
chaste
conversation
coupled
with
1Pet3:3
Whose
adorning
let
it
not
be
that
outward
adorning
of
plaiting
the

of
wearing

of
putting

1Pet3:4
But
let
it
be

not

of
a
meek

is
in
the
sight
of
God

For
after
this
manner
in
the
old
time

holy
women
who
trusted

in
subjection
unto
their

Even
as
Sara

Not

For
he
that
will
love
and
see
good
let
him
refrain
his
tongue
from

his
lips
that
they
speak
no
guile

1Pet3:11
Let

For
the
eyes
of

his
ears

the
face

And
who
is
he
that

But

But
sanctify

that

Having

they
speak

of

may
be
ashamed
that
falsely
accuse

For
it
is
if
the
will
of
God
be
that
ye
suffer
for
well
than
for
evil
1Pet3:18
For
Christ
also
hath
once
suffered
for
the
just

the
that
he
might
bring
us
to
being
put
to
death
in

but
quickened
by
the
1Pet3:19
By
which
also
he
went
and
preached
unto
the
spirits
in
1Pet3:20
Which
sometime
were
when
once
the
longsuffering
of
God
waited
in
the
days
of
while
the
ark
was
a
prepar

wherein
that
eight
souls
were
saved
by
1Pet3:21
The
like
figure
whereunto
even
baptism
doth
also
now
save
us
(not
the
putting
away
of
the
filth
of
the
but
the
answ

of
a
good
conscience
toward
God,)
by
the
resurrection
of

1Pet3:22
Who
is
gone
into
and
is
on
the
right
hand
of
angels
and
authorities
and
powers
being
made
subject
unto
1Pet4:1
Forasmuch
then
as
Christ
hath
suffered
for
us
in
the
arm
yourselves
likewise
with
the
same
for
he
that
hath
su
ffered
in
the
flesh
hath
ceased
from
1Pet4:2
That
he
no
longer
should
live
the
rest
of
his
time
in
the
flesh
to
the
lusts
of
but
to
the
will
of
1Pet4:3
For
the
time
past
of
our
life
may
suffice
us
to
have
wrought
the
will
of
the
when
we
walked
in
lu
sts,
excess
of
and
abominable
idolatries:
1Pet4:4
Wherein
they
think
it
strange
that
ye
run
not
with
them
to
the
same
excess
of
speaking
evil
of
1Pet4:5
Who
shall
give
account
to
him
that
is
ready
to
judge
the
quick
and
the
1Pet4:6
For
for
this
cause
was
the
gospel
preached
also
to
them
that

they
might
be
judged
according
to
men
in
the
fl

but
live
according
to
God
in
the
1Pet4:7
But
the
end
of
all
things
is
at

ye
therefore
and
watch
unto
1Pet4:8
And
above
all
things
have
fervent
charity
among

charity

cover
the
multitude
of
1Pet4:9
Use
hospitality
one
to
another
without

As
every
man
hath
received
the
even
so

same

good
stewards
of

manifold
grace
of
G

1Pet4:11
If
any
man
let
him
speak
as
the
oracles
of
if
any
man
let
him
do
it
as
of
the
ability
which
God
give
that
God
in
all
things
may
be
glorified
through
Jesus
to
whom
be
praise
and
dominion
for
ever
and
1Pet4:12
think
it
not
strange
concerning
the
fiery
trial
which
is
to
try
as
though
some
strange
thing
happened
unto

ou:
1Pet4:13
But
inasmuch
as
ye
are
partakers
of
Christ's
when
his
glory
shall
be

may
be
glad

But
let

you
suffer
as

or
as

or
as
an

as
a
busybody
in
other
men's

Yet
if
any
man
suffer
as
a
let
him
not
be
but
let
him
glorify
God
on
this

For
the
time
is
come
that

must
begin
at

house
of

if

shall
the

be

And

Wherefore
let

2Pet1:1
Simon
a
servant
and
an
apostle
of
Jesus
to
them
that
have
obtained
like
precious
faith
with
us
through
the
r
ighteousness
of
God
and
our
Saviour
Jesus
2Pet1:2
Grace
and
peace
be
multiplied
unto
you
through
the
knowledge
of
and
of
Jesus
our
2Pet1:3
According
as
his
divine
power
hath
given
unto
us
all
things
that
pertain
unto
life
and
through
the
knowledge
of
him
that
hath
called
us
to
glory
and
2Pet1:4
Whereby
are
given
unto
us
exceeding
great
and
precious
that
by
these
ye
might
be
partakers
of
the
divine
having
escaped
the
corruption
that
is
in
the
world
through
2Pet1:5
And
beside
giving
all
add
to
your
faith
and
to
virtue
2Pet1:6
And
to
knowledge
and
to
temperance
and
to
patience
2Pet1:7
And
to
godliness
brotherly
and
to
brotherly
kindness
2Pet1:8
For
if
these
things
be
in
and
they
make
you
that
ye
shall
neither
be
barren
nor
unfruitful
in
the
knowledge
of
our
Lord
Jesus
2Pet1:9
But
he
that
lacketh
these
things
is
and
cannot
see
afar
and
hath
forgotten
that
he
was
purged
from
his
old
sins
.
2Pet1:10
Wherefore
the
give
diligence
to
make
your
calling
and
election
for
if
ye
do
these
ye
shall
never

For
so
an
entrance
shall
be
ministered
unto
you
abundantly
into
the
everlasting
kingdom
of
our
Lord
and
Saviour
Jesus
Chri
2Pet1:12
Wherefore
I
will
not
be
negligent
to
put
you
always
in
remembrance
of
these
though
ye
know
and
be
establishe
d
in
the
present
2Pet1:13
I
think
it
as
long
as
I
am
in
this
to
stir
you
up
by
putting
you
in
2Pet1:14
Knowing
that
shortly
I
must
put
off
this
my
even
as
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
hath
shewed
2Pet1:15
Moreover
I
will
endeavour
that
ye
may
be
able
after
my
decease
to
have
these
things
always
in
2Pet1:16
For
we
have
not
followed
cunningly
devised
when
we
made
known
unto
you
the
power
and
coming
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Chri
but
were
eyewitnesses
of
his
2Pet1:17
For
he
received
from
God
the
Father
honour
and
when
there
came
such
a
voice
to
him
from
the
excellent
This
i
s
my
beloved
in
whom
I
am
well
2Pet1:18
And
this
voice
which
came
from
heaven
we
when
we
were
with
him
in
the
holy
2Pet1:19
We
have
also
a
more
sure
word
of
whereunto
ye
do
well
that
ye
take
as
unto
a
light
that
shineth
in
a
dark
until
the
day
and
the
day
star
arise
in
your
2Pet1:20
Knowing
this
that
no
prophecy
of
the
scripture
is
of
any
private
2Pet1:21
For
the
prophecy
came
not
in
old
time
by
the
will
of
but
holy
men
of
God
spake
as
they
were
moved
by
the
Holy
2Pet2:1
But
there
were
false
prophets
also
among
the
even
as
there
shall
be
false
teachers
among
who
privily
shall
bri

in
damnable
heresies,
even
denying
the
Lord
that
bought
and
bring
upon
themselves
swift
2Pet2:2
And
many
shall
follow
their
pernicious
by
reason
of
whom
the
way
of
truth
shall
be
evil
spoken
2Pet2:3
And
through
covetousness
shall
they
with
feigned
words
make
merchandise
of
whose
judgment
now
of
a
long
time
lingereth
and
their
damnation
slumbereth
2Pet2:4
For
if
God
spared
not
the
angels
that
but
cast
them
down
to
and
delivered
them
into
chains
of
to
be
reserved
unto
2Pet2:5
And
spared
not
the
old
but
saved
Noah

eighth

preacher
of
bringing

the
flood
upon
the
world
of

And
turning
the
cities
of
Sodom
and
Gomorrha
into
ashes
condemned
them
with
an
making
them
an
ensample
unto
thos

And

filthy
conversation
of

But
as

Having

full

that
cannot
cease
from
beguiling
unstable
an
heart
they
have
exercised
with
covetous
cursed
2Pet2:15
Which
have
forsaken
the
right
and
are
gone
following
the
way
of
Balaam
the
son
of
Bosor,
who
loved
the
wages
of

But
was
rebuked
for

For
when

a

escaped
the
pollutions
of

through

knowledge
of

Jesus
the

again
entangled

the
latter

is
worse

For
it

been
better
for

This
second
I
now
write
unto
in
both
which
I
stir
up
your
pure
minds
by
way
of

That
ye
may
be
mindful
of

words
which
were
spoken
before
by
the
holy

of

For
this
is
the
love
of

victory

I
have
a
few
things
against

to
seduce
my
servants

As

as
I
I
rebuke

be
zealous
and
Rev3:20
I
stand
at
the
and
if
any
man
hear
my
and
open

I
will
come
in
to
and
will
sup
wi
th
and
he
with
Rev3:21
To
him
that
overcometh
will
I
grant
to
sit
with
me
in
my
even
as
I
also
and
am
set
down
with
my
Father
in
his
Rev3:22
He
that
hath
an
let
him
hear
what
the
Spirit
saith
unto
the
Rev4:1
After
this
I
a
door
was
opened
in
and
the
first
voice
which
I
heard
was
as
it
were
of
a
trumpet
talking
with
which
Come
up
and
I
will
shew
thee
things
which
must
be
Rev4:2
And
immediately
I
was
in
the
a
throne
was
set
in
and
one
sat
on
the
Rev4:3
And
he
that
sat
was
to
look
upon
like
a
jasper
and
a
sardine
and
there
was
a
rainbow
round
about
the
in
sight
like
unto
an
Rev4:4
And
round
about
the
throne
were
four
and
twenty
and
upon
the
seats
I
saw
four
and
twenty
elders
clothed
in
w
hite
and
they
had
on
their
heads
crowns
of
Rev4:5
And
out
of
the
throne
proceeded
lightnings
and
thunderings
and
and
there
were
seven
lamps
of
fire
burning
before
the
which
are
the
seven
Spirits
of
Rev4:6
And
before
the
throne
there
was
a
sea
of
glass
like
unto
and
in
the
midst
of
the
and
round
about
the
throne
,
were
four
beasts
full
of
eyes
before
and
Rev4:7
And
the
first
beast
was
like
a
and
the
second
beast
like
a
and
the
third
beast
had
a
face
as
a
and
the
four
th
beast
was
like
a
flying
Rev4:8
And
the
four
beasts
had
each
of
them
six
wings
about
and
they
were
full
of
eyes
and
they
rest
not
day
and
night
,
LORD
God
which
and
and
is
to
Rev4:9
And
when
those
beasts
give
glory
and
honour
and
thanks
to
him
that
sat
on
the
who
liveth
for
ever
and
Rev4:10
The
four
and
twenty
elders
fall
down
before
him
that
sat
on
the
and
worship
him
that
liveth
for
ever
and
and
cast
their
crowns
before
the
Rev4:11
Thou
art
O
to
receive
glory
and
honour
and
for
thou
hast
created
all
and
for
thy
pleasure
they
are
and
were
Rev5:1
And
I
saw
in
the
right
hand
of
him
that
sat
on
the
throne
a
book
written
within
and
on
the
sealed
with
seven
seals
.
Rev5:2
And
I
saw
a
strong
angel
proclaiming
with
a
loud
Who
is
worthy
to
open
the
and
to
loose
the
seals
Rev5:3
And
no
man
in
nor
in
neither
under
the
was
able
to
open
the
neither
to
look
Rev5:4
And
I
wept
because
no
man
was
found
worthy
to
open
and
to
read
the
neither
to
look
Rev5:5
And
one
of
the
elders
saith
unto
Weep
the
Lion
of
the
tribe
of
Juda,
the
Root
of
hath
prevailed
to
o
pen
the
and
to
loose
the
seven
seals
Rev5:6
And
I
in
the
midst
of
the
throne
and
of
the
four
and
in
the
midst
of
the
stood
a
Lamb
as
it
had
been
having
seven
horns
and
seven
which
are
the
seven
Spirits
of
God
sent
forth
into
all
the
Rev5:7
And
he
came
and
took
the
book
out
of
the
right
hand
of
him
that
sat
upon
the
Rev5:8
And
when
he
had
taken
the
the
four
beasts
and
four
and
twenty
elders
fell
down
before
the
having
every
one
of
th
em
and
golden
vials
full
of
which
are
the
prayers
of
Rev5:9
And
they
sung
a
new
Thou
art
worthy
to
take
the
and
to
open
the
seals
for
thou
wast
and
hast
redeemed
us
to
God
by
thy
blood
out
of
every
and
and
and
Rev5:10
And
hast
made
us
unto
our
God
kings
and
and
we
shall
reign
on
the
Rev5:11
And
I
and
I
heard
the
voice
of
many
angels
round
about
the
throne
and
the
beasts
and
the
and
the
number
of
them
was
ten
thousand
times
ten
and
thousands
of
Rev5:12
Saying
with
a
loud
Worthy
is
the
Lamb
that
was
slain
to
receive
and
and
and
and
hon
and
and
Rev5:13
And
every
creature
which
is
in
and
on
the
and
under
the
and
such
as
are
in
the
and
all
that
are
in
heard
I
and
and
and
be
unto
him
that
sitteth
upon
the
and
unto
the
Lamb
fo
r
ever
and
Rev5:14
And
the
four
beasts
And
the
four
and
twenty
elders
fell
down
and
worshipped
him
that
liveth
for
ever
and
Rev6:1
And
I
saw
when
the
Lamb
opened
one
of
the
and
I
as
it
were
the
noise
of
one
of
the
four
beasts
saying
,
Come
and
Rev6:2
And
I
and
behold
a
white
and
he
that
sat
on
him
had
a
and
a
crown
was
given
unto
and
he
went
forth
con
quering,
and
to
Rev6:3
And
when
he
had
opened
the
second
I
heard
the
second
beast
Come
and
Rev6:4
And
there
went
out
another
horse
that
was
and
power
was
given
to
him
that
sat
thereon
to
take
peace
from
the
and
that
they
should
kill
one
and
there
was
given
unto
him
a
great
Rev6:5
And
when
he
had
opened
the
third
I
heard
the
third
beast
Come
and
And
I
and
lo
a
black
and
he
that
sat
on
him
had
a
pair
of
balances
in
his
Rev6:6
And
I
heard
a
voice
in
the
midst
of
the
four
beasts
A
measure
of
wheat
for
a
and
three
measures
of
barley
for
a
and
see
thou
hurt
not
the
oil
and
the
Rev6:7
And
when
he
had
opened
the
fourth
I
heard
the
voice
of
the
fourth
beast
Come
and
Rev6:8
And
I
and
behold
a
pale
and
his
name
that
sat
on
him
was
and
Hell
followed
with
And
power
was
giv
en
unto
them
over
the
fourth
part
of
the
to
kill
with
and
with
and
with
and
with
the
beasts
of
the
ear
Rev6:9
And
when
he
had
opened
the
fifth
I
saw
under
the
altar
the
souls
of
them
that
were
slain
for
the
word
of
and
for
the
testimony
which
they
Rev6:10
And
they
cried
with
a
loud
How
O
holy
and
dost
thou
not
judge
and
avenge
our
blood
on
them
that
dwell
on
the
Rev6:11
And
white
robes
were
given
unto
every
one
of
and
it
was
said
unto
that
they
should
rest
yet
for
a
little
season
,
until
their
fellowservants
also
and
their
that
should
be
killed
as
they
should
be
Rev6:12
And
I
beheld
when
he
had
opened
the
sixth
there
was
a
great
and
the
sun
became
black
as
sackclot
h
of
and
the
moon
became
as
Rev6:13
And
the
stars
of
heaven
fell
unto
the
even
as
a
fig
tree
casteth
her
untimely
when
she
is
shaken
of
a
mighty
w
Rev6:14
And
the
heaven
departed
as
a
scroll
when
it
is
rolled
and
every
mountain
and
island
were
moved
out
of
their
place
s.
Rev6:15
And
the
kings
of
the
and
the
great
and
the
rich
and
the
chief
and
the
mighty
and
every
bond
and
every
free
hid
themselves
in
the
dens
and
in
the
rocks
of
the
Rev6:16
And
said
to
the
mountains
and
Fall
on
and
hide
us
from
the
face
of
him
that
sitteth
on
the
and
from
the
wrath
of
the
Rev6:17
For
the
great
day
of
his
wrath
is
and
who
shall
be
able
to
Rev7:1
And
after
these
things
I
saw
four
angels
standing
on
the
four
corners
of
the
holding
the
four
winds
of
the
tha
t
the
wind
should
not
blow
on
the
nor
on
the
nor
on
any
Rev7:2
And
I
saw
another
angel
ascending
from
the
having
the
seal
of
the
living
and
he
cried
with
a
loud
voice
to
the
fo
ur
to
whom
it
was
given
to
hurt
the
earth
and
the
Rev7:3
Hurt
not
the
neither
the
nor
the
till
we
have
sealed
the
servants
of
our
God
in
their
Rev7:4
And
I
heard
the
number
of
them
which
were
and
there
were
sealed
an
hundred
and
forty

After
this
I
a
great
which
no
man
could

all
and
kindreds,
and
and
to
ngues,
stood
before
the
and
before
the
clothed
with
white
and
palms
in
their
Rev7:10
And
cried
with
a
loud
Salvation
to
our
God
which
sitteth
upon
the
and
unto
the
Rev7:11
And
all
the
angels
stood
round
about
the
and
about
the
elders
and
the
four
and
fell
before
the
throne
on
th
eir
and
worshipped

God
for

And
one
of

saying
unto
What

arrayed
in
white
and
whence

And
I
said

And
he
said
to
These

which

out
of

made
them
white

Therefore

They

For

feed
and
shall
lead
them
unto
living
fountains
of
and
God
shall
wipe
away
all
tears
from
their

And
when
he
had
opened
the
seventh
there
was
silence
in
heaven
about
the
space
of
half
an

And
I
saw
the
seven
angels

And
another

came
and
stood
at

And

it
with

there
were

And

And

with
a
loud
to
the
inhabi
ters
of
the
earth
by
reason
of
the
other
voices
of
the
trumpet
of
the
three
which
are
yet
to
Rev9:1
And
the
fifth
angel
and
I
saw
a
star
fall
from
heaven
unto
the
and
to
him
was
given
the
key
of
the
bottomles
s
Rev9:2
And
he
opened
the
bottomless
and
there
arose
a
smoke
out
of
the
as
the
smoke
of
a
great
and
the
sun
and
t
he
air
were
darkened
by
reason
of
the
smoke
of
the
Rev9:3
And
there
came
out
of
the
smoke
locusts
upon
the
and
unto
them
was
given
as
the
scorpions
of
the
earth
have
po
wer.
Rev9:4
And
it
was
commanded
them
that
they
should
not
hurt
the
grass
of
the
neither
any
green
neither
any
but
o
nly
those
men
which
have
not
the
seal
of
God
in
their
Rev9:5
And
to
them
it
was
given
that
they
should
not
kill
but
that
they
should
be
tormented
five
and
their
torment
wa
s
as
the
torment
of
a
when
he
striketh
a
Rev9:6
And
in
those
days
shall
men
seek
and
shall
not
find
and
shall
desire
to
and
death
shall
flee
from
Rev9:7
And
the
shapes
of
the
locusts
were
like
unto
horses
prepared
unto
and
on
their
heads
were
as
it
were
crowns
like
gol
d,
and
their
faces
were
as
the
faces
of
Rev9:8
And
they
had
hair
as
the
hair
of
and
their
teeth
were
as
the
teeth
of
Rev9:9
And
they
had
breastplates,
as
it
were
breastplates
of
and
the
sound
of
their
wings
was
as
the
sound
of
chariots
of
man
y
horses
running
to
Rev9:10
And
they
had
tails
like
unto
and
there
were
stings
in
their
and
their
power
was
to
hurt
men
five
Rev9:11
And
they
had
a
king
over
which
is
the
angel
of
the
bottomless
whose
name
in
the
Hebrew
tongue
is
but
in
the
Greek
tongue
hath
his
name
Rev9:12
One
woe
is
there
come
two
woes
more
Rev9:13
And
the
sixth
angel
and
I
heard
a
voice
from
the
four
horns
of
the
golden
altar
which
is
before
Rev9:14
Saying
to
the
sixth
angel
which
had
the
Loose
the
four
angels
which
are
bound
in
the
great
river
Rev9:15
And
the
four
angels
were
which
were
prepared
for
an
and
a
and
a
and
a
for
to
slay
the
third
part
of
Rev9:16
And
the
number
of
the
army
of
the
horsemen
were
two
hundred
thousand
and
I
heard
the
number
of
Rev9:17
And
thus
I
saw
the
horses
in
the
and
them
that
sat
on
having
breastplates
of
and
of
jacinth,
and
brimst
and
the
heads
of
the
horses
were
as
the
heads
of
and
out
of
their
mouths
issued
fire
and
smoke
and
Rev9:18
By
these
three
was
the
third
part
of
men
by
the
and
by
the
and
by
the
which
issued
out
of
t
heir
Rev9:19
For
their
power
is
in
their
and
in
their
for
their
tails
were
like
unto
and
had
and
with
the
m
they
do
Rev9:20
And
the
rest
of
the
men
which
were
not
killed
by
these
plagues
yet
repented
not
of
the
works
of
their
that
they
shou
ld
not
worship
and
idols
of
and
and
and
and
of
which
neither
can
nor
nor
Rev9:21
Neither
repented
they
of
their
nor
of
their
sorceries,
nor
of
their
nor
of
their
Rev10:1
And
I
saw
another
mighty
angel
come
down
from
clothed
with
a
and
a
rainbow
was
upon
his
and
his
face
w
as
as
it
were
the
and
his
feet
as
pillars
of
Rev10:2
And
he
had
in
his
hand
a
little
book
and
he
set
his
right
foot
upon
the
and
his
left
foot
on
the
Rev10:3
And
cried
with
a
loud
as
when
a
lion
roareth:
and
when
he
had
seven
thunders
uttered
their
Rev10:4
And
when
the
seven
thunders
had
uttered
their
I
was
about
to
and
I
heard
a
voice
from
heaven
saying
unto
Seal
up
those
things
which
the
seven
thunders
and
write
them
Rev10:5
And
the
angel
which
I
saw
stand
upon
the
sea
and
upon
the
earth
lifted
up
his
hand
to
Rev10:6
And
sware
by
him
that
liveth
for
ever
and
who
created
and
the
things
that
therein
and
the
and
the
things
that
therein
and
the
and
the
things
which
are
that
there
should
be
time
no
Rev10:7
But
in
the
days
of
the
voice
of
the
seventh
when
he
shall
begin
to
the
mystery
of
God
should
be
as
he
hath
declared
to
his
servants
the
Rev10:8
And
the
voice
which
I
heard
from
heaven
spake
unto
me
and
Go
and
take
the
little
book
which
is
open
in
the
han
d
of
the
angel
which
standeth
upon
the
sea
and
upon
the
Rev10:9
And
I
went
unto
the
and
said
unto
Give
me
the
little
And
he
said
unto
Take
and
eat
it
and
it
shall
make
thy
belly
but
it
shall
be
in
thy
mouth
sweet
as
Rev10:10
And
I
took
the
little
book
out
of
the
angel's
and
ate
it
and
it
was
in
my
mouth
sweet
as
and
as
soon
as
I
had
eaten
my
belly
was
Rev10:11
And
he
said
unto
Thou
must
prophesy
again
before
many
and
and
and
Rev11:1
And
there
was
given
me
a
reed
like
unto
a
and
the
angel
and
measure
the
temple
of
and
the
al
and
them
that
worship
Rev11:2
But
the
court
which
is
without
the
temple
leave
and
measure
it
for
it
is
given
unto
the
and
the
holy
ci
ty
shall
they
tread
under
foot
forty
and
two
Rev11:3
And
I
will
give
power
unto
my
two
and
they
shall
prophesy
a
thousand
two
hundred
and
threescore
clothed
in
Rev11:4
These
are
the
two
olive
and
the
two
candlesticks
standing
before
the
God
of
the
Rev11:5
And
if
any
man
will
hurt
fire
proceedeth
out
of
their
and
devoureth
their
and
if
any
man
will
hurt
th
he
must
in
this
manner
be
Rev11:6
These
have
power
to
shut
that
it
rain
not
in
the
days
of
their
and
have
power
over
waters
to
turn
them
to
and
to
smite
the
earth
with
all
as
often
as
they
Rev11:7
And
when
they
shall
have
finished
their
the
beast
that
ascendeth
out
of
the
bottomless
pit
shall
make
war
agains
t
and
shall
overcome
and
kill
Rev11:8
And
their
dead
bodies
shall
lie
in
the
street
of
the
great
which
spiritually
is
called
Sodom
and
where
also
ou
r
Lord
was
Rev11:9
And
they
of
the
people
and
kindreds
and
tongues
and
nations
shall
see
their
dead
bodies
three
days
and
an
and
shall
n
ot
suffer
their
dead
bodies
to
be
put
in
Rev11:10
And
they
that
dwell
upon
the
earth
shall
rejoice
over
and
make
and
shall
send
gifts
one
to
because
t
hese
two
prophets
tormented
them
that
dwelt
on
the
Rev11:11
And
after
three
days
and
an
half
the
Spirit
of
life
from
God
entered
into
and
they
stood
upon
their
and
great
fear
fell
upon
them
which
saw
Rev11:12
And
they
heard
a
great
voice
from
heaven
saying
unto
Come
up
And
they
ascended
up
to
heaven
in
a
and
their
enemies
beheld
Rev11:13
And
the
same
hour
was
there
a
great
and
the
tenth
part
of
the
city
and
in
the
earthquake
were
slain
of
m
en
seven
and
the
remnant
were
affrighted,
and
gave
glory
to
the
God
of
Rev11:14
The
second
woe
is
the
third
woe
cometh
Rev11:15
And
the
seventh
angel
and
there
were
great
voices
in
The
kingdoms
of
this
world
are
become
the
ki
ngdoms
of
our
and
of
his
and
he
shall
reign
for
ever
and
Rev11:16
And
the
four
and
twenty
which
sat
before
God
on
their
fell
upon
their
and
worshipped
Rev11:17
We
give
thee
O
LORD
God
which
and
and
art
to
because
thou
hast
taken
to
thee
th
y
great
and
hast
Rev11:18
And
the
nations
were
and
thy
wrath
is
and
the
time
of
the
that
they
should
be
and
that
thou
sho
uldest
give
reward
unto
thy
servants
the
and
to
the
and
them
that
fear
thy
small
and
and
shouldest
d
estroy
them
which
destroy
the
Rev11:19
And
the
temple
of
God
was
opened
in
and
there
was
seen
in
his
temple
the
ark
of
his
and
there
were
ligh
tnings,
and
and
thunderings,
and
an
and
great
Rev12:1
And
there
appeared
a
great
wonder
in
a
woman
clothed
with
the
and
the
moon
under
her
and
upon
her
head
a
crown
of
twelve
Rev12:2
And
she
being
with
child
travailing
in
and
pained
to
be
Rev12:3
And
there
appeared
another
wonder
in
and
behold
a
great
red
having
seven
heads
and
ten
and
seven
cro
wns
upon
his
Rev12:4
And
his
tail
drew
the
third
part
of
the
stars
of
and
did
cast
them
to
the
and
the
dragon
stood
before
the
wo
man
which
was
ready
to
be
for
to
devour
her
child
as
soon
as
it
was
Rev12:5
And
she
brought
forth
a
man
who
was
to
rule
all
nations
with
a
rod
of
and
her
child
was
caught
up
unto
an
d
to
his
Rev12:6
And
the
woman
fled
into
the
where
she
hath
a
place
prepared
of
that
they
should
feed
her
there
a
thousand
two
hundred
and
threescore
Rev12:7
And
there
was
war
in
Michael
and
his
angels
fought
against
the
and
the
dragon
fought
and
his
Rev12:8
And
prevailed
neither
was
their
place
found
any
more
in
Rev12:9
And
the
great
dragon
was
cast
that
old
called
the
and
which
deceiveth
the
whole
he
was
c
ast
out
into
the
and
his
angels
were
cast
out
with
Rev12:10
And
I
heard
a
loud
voice
saying
in
Now
is
come
and
and
the
kingdom
of
our
and
the
power
of
his
for
the
accuser
of
our
brethren
is
cast
which
accused
them
before
our
God
day
and
Rev12:11
And
they
overcame
him
by
the
blood
of
the
and
by
the
word
of
their
and
they
loved
not
their
lives
unto
th
e
Rev12:12
Therefore
ye
and
ye
that
dwell
in
Woe
to
the
inhabiters
of
the
earth
and
of
the
for
the
devil
is
come
down
unto
having
great
because
he
knoweth
that
he
hath
but
a
short
Rev12:13
And
when
the
dragon
saw
that
he
was
cast
unto
the
he
persecuted
the
woman
which
brought
forth
the
man
Rev12:14
And
to
the
woman
were
given
two
wings
of
a
great
that
she
might
fly
into
the
into
her
where
she
is
nourished
for
a
and
and
half
a
from
the
face
of
the
Rev12:15
And
the
serpent
cast
out
of
his
mouth
water
as
a
flood
after
the
that
he
might
cause
her
to
be
carried
away
of
the
Rev12:16
And
the
earth
helped
the
and
the
earth
opened
her
and
swallowed
up
the
flood
which
the
dragon
cast
out
of
hi
s
Rev12:17
And
the
dragon
was
wroth
with
the
and
went
to
make
war
with
the
remnant
of
her
which
keep
the
commandments
of
and
have
the
testimony
of
Jesus
Rev13:1
And
I
stood
upon
the
sand
of
the
and
saw
a
beast
rise
up
out
of
the
having
seven
heads
and
ten
and
upon
hi
s
horns
ten
and
upon
his
heads
the
name
of
Rev13:2
And
the
beast
which
I
saw
was
like
unto
a
and
his
feet
were
as
the
feet
of
a
and
his
mouth
as
the
mouth
of
a
and
the
dragon
gave
him
his
and
his
and
great
Rev13:3
And
I
saw
one
of
his
heads
as
it
were
wounded
to
and
his
deadly
wound
was
and
all
the
world
wondered
after
t
he
Rev13:4
And
they
worshipped
the
dragon
which
gave
power
unto
the
and
they
worshipped
the
Who
is
like
unto
the
who
is
able
to
make
war
with
Rev13:5
And
there
was
given
unto
him
a
mouth
speaking
great
things
and
and
power
was
given
unto
him
to
continue
forty
and
two
Rev13:6
And
he
opened
his
mouth
in
blasphemy
against
to
blaspheme
his
and
his
and
them
that
dwell
in
Rev13:7
And
it
was
given
unto
him
to
make
war
with
the
and
to
overcome
and
power
was
given
him
over
all
kindreds,
and
and
Rev13:8
And
all
that
dwell
upon
the
earth
shall
worship
whose
names
are
not
written
in
the
book
of
life
of
the
Lamb
slain
from
the
foundation
of
the
Rev13:9
If
any
man
have
an
let
him
Rev13:10
He
that
leadeth
into
captivity
shall
go
into
he
that
killeth
with
the
sword
must
be
killed
with
the
Here
is
the
patience
and
the
faith
of
the
Rev13:11
And
I
beheld
another
beast
coming
up
out
of
the
and
he
had
two
horns
like
a
and
he
spake
as
a
Rev13:12
And
he
exerciseth
all
the
power
of
the
first
beast
before
and
causeth
the
earth
and
them
which
dwell
therein
to
worsh
ip
the
first
whose
deadly
wound
was
Rev13:13
And
he
doeth
great
so
that
he
maketh
fire
come
down
from
heaven
on
the
earth
in
the
sight
of
Rev13:14
And
deceiveth
them
that
dwell
on
the
earth
by
the
means
of
those
miracles
which
he
had
power
to
do
in
the
sight
of
the
bea
saying
to
them
that
dwell
on
the
that
they
should
make
an
image
to
the
which
had
the
wound
by
a
and
did
li
ve.
Rev13:15
And
he
had
power
to
give
life
unto
the
image
of
the
that
the
image
of
the
beast
should
both
and
cause
that
a
s
many
as
would
not
worship
the
image
of
the
beast
should
be
Rev13:16
And
he
causeth
both
small
and
rich
and
free
and
to
receive
a
mark
in
their
right
or
in
their
Rev13:17
And
that
no
man
might
buy
or
save
he
that
had
the
or
the
name
of
the
or
the
number
of
his
Rev13:18
Here
is
Let
him
that
hath
understanding
count
the
number
of
the
for
it
is
the
number
of
a
and
his
numb
er
is
Six
hundred
threescore
and
Rev14:1
And
I
a
Lamb
stood
on
the
mount
and
with
him
an
hundred
forty
and
four
having
his
Father's
name
written
in
their
Rev14:2
And
I
heard
a
voice
from
as
the
voice
of
many
and
as
the
voice
of
a
great
and
I
heard
the
voice
of
harpers
harping
with
their
Rev14:3
And
they
sung
as
it
were
a
new
song
before
the
and
before
the
four
and
the
and
no
man
could
learn
t
hat
song
but
the
hundred
and
forty
and
four
which
were
redeemed
from
the
Rev14:4
These
are
they
which
were
not
defiled
with
for
they
are
These
are
they
which
follow
the
Lamb
whithersoever
he
goeth.
These
were
redeemed
from
among
being
the
firstfruits
unto
God
and
to
the
Rev14:5
And
in
their
mouth
was
found
no
for
they
are
without
fault
before
the
throne
of
Rev14:6
And
I
saw
another
angel
fly
in
the
midst
of
having
the
everlasting
gospel
to
preach
unto
them
that
dwell
on
the
ear
and
to
every
and
and
and
Rev14:7
Saying
with
a
loud
Fear
and
give
glory
to
for
the
hour
of
his
judgment

and
worship
him
that
made

And
there
followed
another
Babylon

is
that
great
because
she
made
all
nations
drink
of
the
wine
of
the
wrath
of
her
Rev14:9
And
the
third
angel
followed
saying
with
a
loud
If
any
man
worship
the
beast
and
his
and
receive
his
ma
rk
in
his
or
in
his
Rev14:10
The
same
shall
drink
of
the
wine
of
the
wrath
of
which
is
poured
out
without
mixture
into
the
cup
of
his
and
he
shall
be
tormented
with
fire
and
brimstone
in
the
presence
of
the
holy
and
in
the
presence
of
the
Rev14:11
And
the
smoke
of
their
torment
ascendeth
up
for
ever
and
and
they
have
no
rest
day
nor
who
worship
the
beast
and
his
and
whosoever
receiveth
the
mark
of
his
Rev14:12
Here
is
the
patience
of
the
here
are
they
that
keep
the
commandments
of
and
the
faith
of
Rev14:13
And
I
heard
a
voice
from
heaven
saying
unto
Blessed
are
the
dead
which
die
in
the
Lord
from
sa
ith
the
that
they
may
rest
from
their
and
their
works
do
follow
Rev14:14
And
I
and
behold
a
white
and
upon
the
cloud
one
sat
like
unto
the
Son
of
having
on
his
head
a
golden
c
rown,
and
in
his
hand
a
sharp
Rev14:15
And
another
angel
came
out
of
the
crying
with
a
loud
voice
to
him
that
sat
on
the
Thrust
in
thy
and
for
the
time
is
come
for
thee
to
for
the
harvest
of
the
earth

Rev14:16
And
he
that
sat
on
the
cloud
thrust
in
his
sickle
on
the
and
the
earth
was
Rev14:17
And
another
angel
came
out
of
the
temple
which
is
in
he
also
having
a
sharp
Rev14:18
And
another
angel
came
out
from
the
which
had
power
over
and
cried
with
a
loud
cry
to
him
that
had
the
sharp
Thrust
in
thy
sharp
and
gather
the
clusters
of
the
vine
of
the
for
her
grapes
are
fully
Rev14:19
And
the
angel
thrust
in
his
sickle
into
the
and
gathered
the
vine
of
the
and
cast
it
into
the
great
winepres
s
of
the
wrath
of
Rev14:20
And
the
winepress
was
trodden
without
the
and
blood
came
out
of
the
even
unto
the
horse
by
the
s
pace
of
a
thousand
and
six
hundred
Rev15:1
And
I
saw
another
sign
in
great
and
seven
angels
having
the
seven
last
for
in
them
is
filled
u
p
the
wrath
of
Rev15:2
And
I
saw
as
it
were
a
sea
of
glass
mingled
with
and
them
that
had
gotten
the
victory
over
the
and
over
his

and
over
his
and
over
the
number
of
his
stand
on
the
sea
of
having
the
harps
of

And
they
sing
the
song
of
Moses

servant

the
song
of
the
Great

marvellous
are

come
and

for

made
Rev15:5
And
after
that
I
the
temple
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
testimony
in
heaven
was
Rev15:6
And
the
seven
angels
came
out
of
the
having
the
seven
clothed
in
pure
and
white
and
having
their
br
easts
girded
with
golden
Rev15:7
And
one
of
the
four
beasts
gave
unto
the
seven
angels
seven
golden
vials
full
of
the
wrath
of
who
liveth
for
ever
and
Rev15:8
And
the
temple
was
filled
with
smoke
from
the
glory
of
and
from
his
and
no
man
was
able
to
enter
into
the
templ
e,
till
the
seven
plagues
of
the
seven
angels
were
Rev16:1
And
I
heard
a
great
voice
out
of
the
temple
saying
to
the
seven
Go
your
and
pour
out
the
vials
of
the
wrath
o
f
God
upon
the
Rev16:2
And
the
first
and
poured
out
his
vial
upon
the
and
there
fell
a
noisome
and
grievous
sore
upon
the
men
which
h
ad
the
mark
of
the
and
upon
them
which
worshipped
his
Rev16:3
And
the
second
angel
poured
out
his
vial
upon
the
and
it
became
as
the
blood
of
a
dead
and
every
living
soul
died
in
the
Rev16:4
And
the
third
angel
poured
out
his
vial
upon
the
rivers
and
fountains
of
and
they
became
Rev16:5
And
I
heard
the
angel
of
the
waters
Thou
art
O
which
and
and
shalt
because
thou
hast
j
udged
Rev16:6
For
they
have
shed
the
blood
of
saints
and
and
thou
hast
given
them
blood
to
for
they
are
Rev16:7
And
I
heard
another
out
of
the
altar
Even
Lord
God
true
and
righteous
are
thy
Rev16:8
And
the
fourth
angel
poured
out
his
vial
upon
the
and
power
was
given
unto
him
to
scorch
men
with
Rev16:9
And
men
were
scorched
with
great
and
blasphemed
the
name
of
which
hath
power
over
these
and
they
repent
ed
not
to
give
him
Rev16:10
And
the
fifth
angel
poured
out
his
vial
upon
the
seat
of
the
and
his
kingdom
was
full
of
and
they
gnawed
their
tongues
for
Rev16:11
And
blasphemed
the
God
of
heaven
because
of
their
pains
and
their
and
repented
not
of
their
Rev16:12
And
the
sixth
angel
poured
out
his
vial
upon
the
great
river
and
the
water
thereof
was
dried
that
the
way
o
f
the
kings
of
the
east
might
be
Rev16:13
And
I
saw
three
unclean
spirits
like
frogs
come
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
and
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
and
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
false
Rev16:14
For
they
are
the
spirits
of
working
which
go
forth
unto
the
kings
of
the
earth
and
of
the
whole
t
o
gather
them
to
the
battle
of
that
great
day
of
God
Rev16:15
I
come
as
a
Blessed
is
he
that
watcheth,
and
keepeth
his
lest
he
walk
and
they
see
his
sha
Rev16:16
And
he
gathered
them
together
into
a
place
called
in
the
Hebrew
tongue
Rev16:17
And
the
seventh
angel
poured
out
his
vial
into
the
and
there
came
a
great
voice
out
of
the
temple
of
from
the
It
is
Rev16:18
And
there
were
and
and
and
there
was
a
great
such
as
was
not
since
men
were
upon
the
so
mighty
an
and
so
Rev16:19
And
the
great
city
was
divided
into
three
and
the
cities
of
the
nations
and
great
Babylon
came
in
remembrance
before
to
give
unto
her
the
cup
of
the
wine
of
the
fierceness
of
his
Rev16:20
And
every
island
fled
and
the
mountains
were
not
Rev16:21
And
there
fell
upon
men
a
great
hail
out
of
every
stone
about
the
weight
of
a
and
men
blasphemed
God
becau
se
of
the
plague
of
the
for
the
plague
thereof
was
exceeding
Rev17:1
And
there
came
one
of
the
seven
angels
which
had
the
seven
and
talked
with
saying
unto
Come
I
will
s
hew
unto
thee
the
judgment
of
the
great
whore
that
sitteth
upon
many
Rev17:2
With
whom
the
kings
of
the
earth
have
committed
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
have
been
made
drunk
with
the
wine
of
her
Rev17:3
So
he
carried
me
away
in
the
spirit
into
the
and
I
saw
a
woman
sit
upon
a
scarlet
coloured
full
of
names
of
having
seven
heads
and
ten
Rev17:4
And
the
woman
was
arrayed
in
purple
and
scarlet
and
decked
with
gold
and
precious
stones
and
having
a
golde
n
cup
in
her
hand
full
of
abominations
and
filthiness
of
her
Rev17:5
And
upon
her
forehead
was
a
name
BABYLON
THE
THE
MOTHER
OF
HARLOTS
AND
ABOMINATIONS
OF
THE
Rev17:6
And
I
saw
the
woman
drunken
with
the
blood
of
the
and
with
the
blood
of
the
martyrs
of
and
when
I
saw
I
wondered
with
great
Rev17:7
And
the
angel
said
unto
Wherefore
didst
thou
I
will
tell
thee
the
mystery
of
the
and
of
the
beast
that
c
arrieth
which
hath
the
seven
heads
and
ten
Rev17:8
The
beast
that
thou
sawest

out
of

not

from

foundation
of

when

yet
Rev17:9
And
here
is
the
mind
which
hath
The
seven
heads

seven
on
which
the
woman
sitteth.
Rev17:10
And
there
are
seven
five
are
and
one
and
the
other
is
not
yet
and
when
he
he
must
continu

a
short
Rev17:11
And
the
beast
that
and
is
even
he
is
the
and
is
of
the
and
goeth
into
Rev17:12
And
the
ten
horns
which
thou
sawest
are
ten
which
have
received
no
kingdom
as
but
receive
power
as
kings
one
h
our
with
the
Rev17:13
These
have
one
and
shall
give
their
power
and
strength
unto
the
Rev17:14
These
shall
make
war
with
the
and
the
Lamb
shall
overcome
for
he
is
Lord
of
and
King
of
and
they
that
are
with
him
are
and
and
Rev17:15
And
he
saith
unto
The
waters
which
thou
sawest,
where
the
whore
sitteth,
are
and
and
and
Rev17:16
And
the
ten
horns
which
thou
sawest
upon
the
these
shall
hate
the
and
shall
make
her
desolate
and
and
shall
eat
her
and
burn
her
with
Rev17:17
For
God
hath
put
in
their
hearts
to
fulfil
his
and
to
and
give
their
kingdom
unto
the
until
the
words
of
God
shall
be
Rev17:18
And
the
woman
which
thou
sawest
is
that
great
which
reigneth
over
the
kings
of
the
Rev18:1
And
after
these
things
I
saw
another
angel
come
down
from
having
great
and
the
earth
was
lightened
with
his
Rev18:2
And
he
cried
mightily
with
a
strong

become
the

For
all

drunk
of

of

have
committed
fornicati

the
merchants
of

are
waxed
rich
through

I
heard
another

from

is
called

And
the

which
were

followed
him
upon

And
out
of

mouth
goeth
a

with

should
smite

I
saw
an

standing

he
cried
with
a
loud
saying
to
all
the
fowls
that
fly
in

Come

gather
yourselves
together

may
eat

make
war
against

And
the

with

the
false

wrought
miracles
before

he
deceived
them

And
the

slain
with
the
sword
of
him
that
sat
upon
the
which
sword
proceeded
out
of
his

all
the
fowls
were
filled
with

And
I
saw
an
angel
come
down
from
having
the
key
of
the
bottomless
pit
and
a
great
chain
in
his
Rev20:2
And
he
laid
hold
on
the
that
old
which
is
the

and
bound
him
a
thousand

And
cast
him
into
the
bottomless

shut
him
and
set
a
seal
upon
that
he
should
deceive
the
nations
no
till

thousand
years
should
be

after
that
he
must
be
loosed

And
I
saw

they
sat
upon

judgment
was
given

were
beheaded

twelve
apostles

that
talked

had
a

And
when

I
fell
down
to
worship
before
the
feet
of

saith
he
